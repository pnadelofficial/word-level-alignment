1.1.1
1
Θουκυδίδης Ἀθηναῖος ξυνέγραψε τὸν πόλεμον τῶν Πελοποννησίων καὶ Ἀθηναίων, ὡς ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς ἀλλήλους, ἀρξάμενος εὐθὺς καθισταμένου καὶ ἐλπίσας μέγαν τε ἔσεσθαι καὶ ἀξιολογώτατον τῶν προγεγενημένων, τεκμαιρόμενος ὅτι ἀκμάζοντές τε ᾖσαν ἐς αὐτὸν ἀμφότεροι παρασκευῇ τῇ πάσῃ καὶ τὸ ἄλλο Ἑλληνικὸν ὁρῶν ξυνιστάμενον πρὸς ἑκατέρους, τὸ μὲν εὐθύς, τὸ δὲ καὶ διανοούμενον.
Thucydides, an Athenian, compiled the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, as they waged war against each other. He began his account from the outset of the war, anticipating that it would be a significant and most noteworthy conflict of all those that had occurred previously, reasoning that both sides were at their peak in terms of total preparation and that he observed the rest of the Greek world aligning with one side or the other, some immediately, and some considering it.

1.1.2
2
κίνησις γὰρ αὕτη μεγίστη δὴ τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἐγένετο καὶ μέρει τινὶ τῶν βαρβάρων, ὡς δὲ εἰπεῖν καὶ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἀνθρώπων.
For this conflict was indeed the greatest upheaval for the Greeks and even for some part of the barbarians, and, one might say, affected most of mankind.

1.1.3
3
τὰ γὰρ πρὸ αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἔτι παλαίτερα σαφῶς μὲν εὑρεῖν διὰ χρόνου πλῆθος ἀδύνατα ἦν, ἐκ δὲ τεκμηρίων ὧν ἐπὶ μακρότατον σκοποῦντί μοι πιστεῦσαι ξυμβαίνει οὐ μεγάλα νομίζω γενέσθαι οὔτε κατὰ τοὺς πολέμους οὔτε ἐς τὰ ἄλλα.
Events before this, and even those more ancient, are difficult to discern clearly due to the passage of time. However, based on the evidence I can rely upon, after extensive examination, I believe they were not of great significance, neither in terms of wars nor in other aspects.

1.2.1
4
φαίνεται γὰρ ἡ νῦν Ἑλλὰς καλουμένη οὐ πάλαι βεβαίως οἰκουμένη, ἀλλὰ μεταναστάσεις τε οὖσαι τὰ πρότερα καὶ ῥᾳδίως ἕκαστοι τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀπολείποντες βιαζόμενοι ὑπό τινων αἰεὶ πλειόνων.
For it appears that what is now called Hellas was not long ago settled in a stable manner, but was subject to frequent migrations, with each group easily abandoning their own places due to being overpowered by others more numerous.

1.2.2
5
τῆς γὰρ ἐμπορίας οὐκ οὔσης, οὐδ’ ἐπιμειγνύντες ἀδεῶς ἀλλήλοις οὔτε κατὰ γῆν οὔτε διὰ θαλάσσης, νεμόμενοί τε τὰ αὑτῶν ἕκαστοι ὅσον ἀποζῆν καὶ περιουσίαν χρημάτων οὐκ ἔχοντες οὐδὲ γῆν φυτεύοντες, ἄδηλον ὂν ὁπότε τις ἐπελθὼν καὶ ἀτειχίστων ἅμα ὄντων ἄλλος ἀφαιρήσεται, τῆς τε καθ’ ἡμέραν ἀναγκαίου τροφῆς πανταχοῦ ἂν ἡγούμενοι ἐπικρατεῖν, οὐ χαλεπῶς ἀπανίσταντο, καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ οὔτε μεγέθει πόλεων ἴσχυον οὔτε τῇ ἄλλῃ παρασκευῇ.
Due to the absence of trade and the lack of safe interaction with each other, either by land or sea, and as each group was only subsisting on what they had, without surplus wealth or cultivating land (it being uncertain when someone might come and seize it, especially since they lacked walled defenses), they easily relocated, considering that they could find their necessary daily sustenance anywhere. This resulted in them not being strong, either in the size of their cities or in other preparations.

1.2.3
6
μάλιστα δὲ τῆς γῆς ἡ ἀρίστη αἰεὶ τὰς μεταβολὰς τῶν οἰκητόρων εἶχεν, ἥ τε νῦν Θεσσαλία καλουμένη καὶ Βοιωτία Πελοποννήσου τε τὰ πολλὰ πλὴν Ἀρκαδίας, τῆς τε ἄλλης ὅσα ἦν κράτιστα.
The most fertile lands always experienced the most changes in inhabitants, notably what is now called Thessaly and Boeotia, and much of the Peloponnese except Arcadia, as well as other highly productive regions.

1.2.4
7
διὰ γὰρ ἀρετὴν γῆς αἵ τε δυνάμεις τισὶ μείζους ἐγγιγνόμεναι στάσεις ἐνεποίουν ἐξ ὧν ἐφθείροντο, καὶ ἅμα ὑπὸ ἀλλοφύλων μᾶλλον ἐπεβουλεύοντο.
For the richness of the land led to greater power for some, which caused internal conflicts that led to their ruin, and made them more susceptible to plots by foreigners.

1.2.5
8
τὴν γοῦν Ἀττικὴν ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον διὰ τὸ λεπτόγεων ἀστασίαστον οὖσαν ἄνθρωποι ᾤκουν οἱ αὐτοὶ αἰεί.
Indeed, Attica, due to its infertile land, remained largely free of internal strife and thus was continuously inhabited by the same people.

1.2.6
9
καὶ παράδειγμα τόδε τοῦ λόγου οὐκ ἐλάχιστόν ἐστι διὰ τὰς μετοικίας ἐς τὰ ἄλλα μὴ ὁμοίως αὐξηθῆναι.
This is a prime example of how the migrations did not similarly contribute to growth in other regions.

1.2.6
10
ἐκ γὰρ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος οἱ πολέμῳ ἢ στάσει ἐκπίπτοντες παρ’ Ἀθηναίους οἱ δυνατώτατοι ὡς βέβαιον ὂν ἀνεχώρουν, καὶ πολῖται γιγνόμενοι εὐθὺς ἀπὸ παλαιοῦ μείζω ἔτι ἐποίησαν πλήθει ἀνθρώπων τὴν πόλιν, ὥστε καὶ ἐς Ἰωνίαν ὕστερον ὡς οὐχ ἱκανῆς οὔσης τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀποικίας ἐξέπεμψαν.
For from the rest of Greece, those displaced by war or sedition fled to Athens as a safe haven, and upon becoming citizens, they further increased the city's population, leading to the establishment of colonies in Ionia due to Attica's inability to sustain them.

1.3.1
11
δηλοῖ δέ μοι καὶ τόδε τῶν παλαιῶν ἀσθένειαν οὐχ ἥκιστα.
This also illustrates the relative weakness of ancient times.

1.3.1
12
πρὸ γὰρ τῶν Τρωικῶν οὐδὲν φαίνεται πρότερον κοινῇ ἐργασαμένη ἡ Ἑλλάς.
For before the Trojan War, Greece appears not to have undertaken any unified action.

1.3.2
13
δοκεῖ δέ μοι, οὐδὲ τ- ὄνομα τοῦτο ξύμπασά πω εἶχεν, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν πρὸ Ἕλληνος τοῦ Δευκαλίωνος καὶ πάνυ οὐδὲ εἶναι ἡ ἐπίκλησις αὕτη, κατὰ ἔθνη δὲ ἄλλα τε καὶ τὸ Πελασγικὸν ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν παρέχεσθαι, Ἕλληνος δὲ καὶ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ Φθιώτιδι ἰσχυσάντων, καὶ ἐπαγομένων αὐτοὺς ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ ἐς τὰς ἄλλας πόλεις, καθ’ ἑκάστους μὲν ἤδη τῇ ὁμιλίᾳ μᾶλλον καλεῖσθαι Ἕλληνας, οὐ μέντοι πολλοῦ γε χρόνου ἐδύνατο καὶ ἅπασιν ἐκνικῆσαι.
It seems to me that the name 'Hellas' was not yet universally applied, but that before Hellen, the son of Deucalion, this name did not even exist. Different tribes, especially the Pelasgic, had their own names. But when Hellen and his sons gained power in Phthiotis, and were invited to aid other cities, gradually the term 'Hellenes' began to be used more widely in interactions, though it took a long time for this name to prevail among all.

1.3.3
14
τεκμηριοῖ δὲ μάλιστα Ὅμηρος;
Homer provides the strongest evidence for this.

1.3.3
15
πολλῷ γὰρ ὕστερον ἔτι καὶ τῶν Τρωικῶν γενόμενος οὐδαμοῦ τοὺς ξύμπαντας ὠνόμασεν, οὐδ’ ἄλλους ἢ τοὺς μετ’ Ἀχιλλέως ἐκ τῆς Φθιώτιδος, οἵπερ καὶ πρῶτοι Ἕλληνες ἦσαν, Δαναοὺς δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἔπεσι καὶ Ἀργείους καὶ Ἀχαιοὺς ἀνακαλεῖ.
For Homer, who lived much later than the Trojan War, never used the name to describe all Greeks, but only those who came with Achilles from Phthiotis, the first to be called Hellenes. In his verses, he refers to them as Danaans, Argives, and Achaeans.

1.3.3
16
οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ βαρβάρους εἴρηκε διὰ τὸ μηδὲ Ἕλληνάς πω, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, ἀντίπαλον ἐς ἓν ὄνομα ἀποκεκρίσθαι.
Nor did he mention 'barbarians', as, in my opinion, the Greeks were not yet distinguished by a single name in opposition to them.

1.3.4
17
οἱ δ’ οὖν ὡς ἕκαστοι Ἕλληνες κατὰ πόλεις τε ὅσοι ἀλλήλων ξυνίεσαν καὶ ξύμπαντες ὕστερον κληθέντες οὐδὲν πρὸ τῶν Τρωικῶν δι’ ἀσθένειαν καὶ ἀμειξίαν ἀλλήλων ἁθρόοι ἔπραξαν.
Therefore, individual Greek communities, as well as all those later known collectively as Greeks, did nothing in concert before the Trojan War due to their weakness and lack of mutual association.

1.3.4
18
ἀλλὰ καὶ ταύτην τὴν στρατείαν θαλάσσῃ ἤδη πλείω χρώμενοι ξυνεξῆλθον.
However, even this expedition, with more extensive use of the sea, they undertook together.

1.4.1
19
Μίνως γὰρ παλαίτατος ὧν ἀκοῇ ἴσμεν ναυτικὸν ἐκτήσατο καὶ τῆς νῦν Ἑλληνικῆς θαλάσσης ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐκράτησε καὶ τῶν Κυκλάδων νήσων ἦρξέ τε καὶ οἰκιστὴς πρῶτος τῶν πλείστων ἐγένετο, Κᾶρας ἐξελάσας καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας ἡγεμόνας ἐγκαταστήσας.
For Minos, the earliest whom we know by report, established a navy and controlled most of what is now the Greek sea. He ruled the Cyclades islands, being the first to colonize most of them, after expelling the Carians and installing his own sons as governors.

1.4.1
20
τό τε λῃστικόν, ὡς εἰκός, καθῄρει ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης ἐφ’ ὅσον ἐδύνατο, τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλον ἰέναι αὐτῷ.
He also, as much as he could, cleared the sea of piracy, to ensure a smoother flow of revenues to himself.

1.5.1
21
οἱ γὰρ Ἕλληνες τὸ πάλαι καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων οἵ τε ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ παραθαλάσσιοι καὶ ὅσοι νήσους εἶχον, ἐπειδὴ ἤρξαντο μᾶλλον περαιοῦσθαι ναυσὶν ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους,
For the Greeks of old, and also the barbarians who lived near the sea on the mainland and those who inhabited the islands, once they began to cross over to one another more frequently by ships,

1.5.2
22
δηλοῦσι δὲ τῶν τε ἠπειρωτῶν τινὲς ἔτι καὶ νῦν, οἷς κόσμος καλῶς τοῦτο δρᾶν, καὶ οἱ παλαιοὶ τῶν ποιητῶν τὰς πύστεις τῶν καταπλεόντων πανταχοῦ ὁμοίως ἐρωτῶντες εἰ λῃσταί εἰσιν, ὡς οὔτε ὧν πυνθάνονται ἀπαξιούντων τὸ ἔργον, οἷς τε ἐπιμελὲς εἴη εἰδέναι οὐκ ὀνειδιζόντων.
This is shown by some that dwell on the continent even at the present day, with whom it is an honour to perform this cleverly; and by the ancient poets, who introduce men asking the question of such as sail to their coasts, in all cases alike, whether they are pirates: as though neither those of whom they inquire, disowned the employment; nor those who were interested in knowing, reproached them with it.

1.5.3
23
ἐλῄζοντο δὲ καὶ κατ’ ἤπειρον ἀλλήλους. καὶ μέχρι τοῦδε πολλὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος τῷ παλαιῷ τρόπῳ νέμεται περί τε Λοκροὺς τοὺς Ὀζόλας καὶ Αἰτωλοὺς καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνας καὶ τὴν ταύτῃ ἤπειρον.
They also robbed one another on the continent; and to this day many parts of Greece live after the old fashion; as the Locri Ozolae, the Aetolians, and Acarnanians, and those in that part of the continent.

1.5.3
24
τό τε σιδηροφορεῖσθαι τούτοις τοῖς ἠπειρώταις ἀπὸ τῆς παλαιᾶς λῃστείας ἐμμεμένηκεν.
And the fashion of wearing arms has continued amongst these continental states from their old trade of piracy.

1.6.1
25
πᾶσα γὰρ ἡ Ἑλλὰς ἐσιδηροφόρει διὰ τὰς ἀφάρκτους τε οἰκήσεις καὶ οὐκ ἀσφαλεῖς παρ’ ἀλλήλους ἐφόδους, καὶ ξυνήθη τὴν δίαιταν μεθ’ ὅπλων ἐποιήσαντο ὥσπερ οἱ βάρβαροι.
For the whole of Greece used to wear arms, owing to their habitations being unprotected, and their communication with each other insecure; and they passed their ordinary life with weapons, like the barbarians.

1.6.2
26
σημεῖον δ’ ἐστὶ ταῦτα τ

1.6.3
27
ἐν τοῖς πρῶτοι δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι τόν τε σίδηρον κατέθεντο καὶ ἀνειμένῃ τῇ διαίτῃ ἐς τὸ τρυφερώτερον μετέστησαν.
Now the Athenians were the first who laid down their armour, and by a more easy style of life changed to greater luxury.

1.6.3
28
καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι αὐτοῖς τῶν εὐδαιμόνων διὰ τὸ ἁβροδίαιτον οὐ πολὺς χρόνος ἐπειδὴ χιτῶνάς τε λινοῦς ἐπαύσαντο φοροῦντες καὶ χρυσῶν τεττίγων ἐνέρσει κρωβύλον ἀναδούμενοι τῶν ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ τριχῶν.
And the elders of their rich men no long time ago ceased wearing from delicacy linen tunics, and binding up a knot of the hair on their heads with a tie of golden grasshoppers.

1.6.3
29
ἀφ’ οὗ καὶ Ἰώνων τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς ἐπὶ πολὺ αὕτη ἡ σκευὴ κατέσχεν.
Whence also this fashion prevailed for a long time with the elders of the Ionians, from their affinity to them.

1.6.4
30
μετρίᾳ δ’ αὖ ἐσθῆτι καὶ ἐς τὸν νῦν τρόπον πρῶτοι Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐχρήσαντο καὶ ἐς τὰ ἄλλα πρὸς τοὺς πολλοὺς οἱ τὰ μείζω κεκτημένοι ἰσοδίαιτοι μάλιστα κατέστησαν.
But on the contrary, a moderate style of dressing, and according to the present mode, was first used by the Lacedaemonians; and in other respects their wealthier men most conformed themselves in their living to the common people.

1.6.5
31
ἐγυμνώθησάν τε πρῶτοι καὶ ἐς τὸ φανερὸν ἀποδύντες λίπα μετὰ τοῦ γυμνάζεσθαι ἠλείψαντο.
And they were the first who stripped themselves, and undressing in public, smeared themselves with grease in their gymnastic exercises.

1.6.5
32
τὸ δὲ πάλαι καὶ ἐν τῷ Ὀλυμπικῷ ἀγῶνι διαζώματα ἔχοντες περὶ τὰ αἰδοῖα οἱ ἀθληταὶ ἠγωνίζοντο, καὶ οὐ πολλὰ ἔτη ἐπειδὴ πέπαυται.
And formerly even at the Olympic games the combatants contended with girdles round their middle; and it is not many years since it ceased to be so.

1.6.5
33
ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς βαρβάροις ἔστιν οἷς νῦν, καὶ μάλιστα τοῖς Ἀσιανοῖς, πυγμῆς καὶ πάλης ἆθλα τίθεται, καὶ διεζωμένοι τοῦτο δρῶσιν.
Nay even now amongst some of the barbarians, and especially those of Asia, prizes for boxing and wrestling are given, and they wear girdles when they contend for them.

1.6.6
34
πολλὰ δ’ ἂν καὶ ἄλλα τις ἀποδείξειε τὸ παλαιὸν Ἑλληνικὸν ὁμοιότροπα τῷ νῦν βαρβαρικῷ διαιτώμενον.
And in many other respects also one might show that the ancient Greeks lived in a manner similar to the barbarians of the present age.

1.7.1
35
τῶν δὲ πόλεων ὅσαι μὲν νεώτατα ᾠκίσθησαν καὶ ἤδη πλωιμωτέρων ὄντων, περιουσίας μᾶλλον ἔχουσαι χρημάτων ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς τοῖς αἰγιαλοῖς τείχεσιν ἐκτίζοντο καὶ τοὺς ἰσθμοὺς ἀπελάμβανον ἐμπορίας τε ἕνεκα καὶ τῆς πρὸς τοὺς προσοίκους ἕκαστοι ἰσχύος.
Of the cities, again, such as were founded most recently and when there were now greater facilities of navigation, having greater abundance of wealth, they were built with walls on the very shores; and occupied isthmuses, with a view both to commerce and to security against their several neighbours.

1.7.1
36
αἱ δὲ παλαιαὶ διὰ τὴν λῃστείαν ἐπὶ πολὺ ἀντίσχουσαν ἀπὸ θαλάσσης μᾶλλον ᾠκίσθησαν, αἵ τε ἐν ταῖς νήσοις καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἠπείροις (ἔφερον γὰρ ἀλλήλους τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὅσοι ὄντες οὐ θαλάσσιοι κάτω ᾤκουν), καὶ μέχρι τοῦδε ἔτι ἀνῳκισμένοι εἰσίν.
Whereas the old ones, owing to the long continuance of piracy, were built farther off from the sea, both those in the islands and those on the mainlands; (for they used to plunder one another, and all the rest who lived by the sea without being seamen;) and even to the present day they are built inland.

1.8.1
37
καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον λῃσταὶ ἦσαν οἱ νησιῶται, Κᾶρές τε ὄντες καὶ Φοίνικες·
And the islanders especially were pirates, being Carians and Phoenicians.

1.8.1
38
οὗτοι γὰρ δὴ τὰς πλείστας τῶν νήσων ᾤκησαν.
For it was these that had colonized most of the islands.

1.8.1
39
μαρτύριον δέ·
And this is a proof of it:

1.8.1
40
Δήλου γὰρ καθαιρομένης ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων ἐν τῷδε τῷ πολέμῳ καὶ τῶν θηκῶν ἀναιρεθεισῶν ὅσαι ἦσαν τῶν τεθνεώτων ἐν τῇ νήσῳ, ὑπὲρ ἥμισυ Κᾶρες ἐφάνησαν, γνωσθέντες τῇ τε σκευῇ τῶν ὅπλων ξυντεθαμμένῃ καὶ τῷ τρόπῳ ᾧ νῦν ἔτι θάπτουσιν.
For when Delos was purified by the Athenians during this war and the graves of all who had died on the island were opened, more than half were found to be Carians, identified by the weapons buried with them and by the burial method still in use today.

1.8.2
41
καταστάντος δὲ τοῦ Μίνω ναυτικοῦ πλωιμώτερα ἐγένετο παρ’ ἀλλήλους (οἱ γὰρ ἐκ τῶν νήσων κακοῦργοι ἀνέστησαν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ, ὅτεπερ καὶ τὰς πολλὰς αὐτῶν κατῴκιζε) καὶ οἱ παρὰ θάλασσαν ἄνθρωποι μᾶλλον ἤδη τὴν κτῆσιν τῶν χρημάτων ποιούμενοι βεβαιότερον ᾤκουν καί τινες καὶ τείχη περιεβάλλοντο ὡς πλουσιώτεροι ἑαυτῶν γιγνόμενοι.
But when the navy of Minos was established, there were greater facilities of sailing to each other. For the malefactors in the islands were expelled by him, at the same time that he was colonizing most of them. And the men on the sea-coast, now making greater acquisition of wealth, led a more settled life and some of them even surrounded themselves with walls, on the strength of growing richer than they had before been.

1.8.3
42
ἐφιέμενοι γὰρ τῶν κερδῶν οἵ τε ἥσσους ὑπέμενον τὴν τῶν κρεισσόνων δουλείαν,
For through desire of gain, the lower orders submitted to be slaves to their betters;

1.8.4
43
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ μᾶλλον ἤδη ὄντες ὕστερον χρόνῳ ἐπὶ Τροίαν ἐστράτευσαν.
And being now more in this state of things, some time after they made the expedition against Troy.

1.9.1
44
Ἀγαμέμνων τέ μοι δοκεῖ τῶν τότε δυνάμει προύχων καὶ οὐ τοσοῦτον τοῖς Τυνδάρεω ὅρκοις κατειλημμένους τοὺς Ἑλένης μνηστῆρας ἄγων τὸν στόλον ἀγεῖραι.
And Agamemnon appears to me to have assembled the armament because he surpassed the men of that day in power, and not so much because he took the suitors of Helen bound by their oaths to Tyndarus.

1.9.2
45
λέγουσι δὲ καὶ οἱ τὰ σαφέστατα Πελοποννησίων μνήμῃ παρὰ τῶν πρότερον δεδεγμένοι Πέλοπά τε πρῶτον πλήθει χρημάτων, ἃ ἦλθεν ἐκ τῆς Ἀσίας ἔχων ἐς ἀνθρώπους ἀπόρους, δύναμιν περιποιησάμενον τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν τῆς χώρας ἔπηλυν ὄντα ὅμως σχεῖν, καὶ ὕστερον τοῖς ἐκγόνοις ἔτι μείζω ξυνενεχθῆναι, Εὐρυσθέως μὲν ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ὑπὸ Ἡρακλειδῶν ἀποθανόντος, Ἀτρέως δὲ μητρὸς ἀδελφοῦ ὄντος αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπιτρέψαντος Εὐρυσθέως, ὅτ’ ἐστράτευε, Μυκήνας τε καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν κατὰ τὸ οἰκεῖον Ἀτρεῖ (τυγχάνειν δὲ αὐτὸν φεύγοντα τὸν πατέρα διὰ τὸν Χρυσίππου θάνατον), καὶ ὡς οὐκέτι ἀνεχώρησεν Εὐρυσθεύς, βουλομένων καὶ τῶν Μυκηναίων φόβῳ τῶν Ἡρακλειδῶν καὶ ἅμα δυνατὸν δοκοῦντα εἶναι καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τεθεραπευκότα τῶν Μυκηναίων τε καὶ ὅσων Εὐρυσθεὺς ἦρχε τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀτρέα παραλαβεῖν, καὶ τῶν Περσειδῶν τοὺς Πελοπίδας μείζους καταστῆναι.
It is said too by those of the Peloponnesians who have received the most certain accounts by tradition from their forefathers, that Pelops first acquired power by the abundance of riches with which he came from Asia to men who were in needy circumstances; and although a new-comer, yet gave his name to the country; and that afterwards still greater power fell to the lot of his descendants, as Eurystheus was killed in Attica by the Heraclidae, and Atreus was his mother's brother, and Eurystheus, when going on the expedition, intrusted Mycenae and the government to Atreus, on the ground of their connexion; (he happened to be flying from his father on account of the death of Chrysippus :) and when Eurystheus did not return again, they say that at the wish of the Mycenaeans themselves, through their fear of the Heraclidae, and also because he appeared to be powerful, and had courted the commons, Atreus received the kingdom of the Mycenaeans and all that Eurystheus ruled over; and that so the descendants of Pelops became greater than those of Perseus.

1.9.3
46
ἅ μοι δοκεῖ Ἀγαμέμνων παραλαβὼν καὶ ναυτικῷ τε ἅμα ἐπὶ πλέον τῶν ἄλλων ἰσχύσας, τὴν στρατείαν οὐ χάριτι τὸ πλέον ἢ φόβῳ ξυναγαγὼν ποιήσασθαι.
And I think that Agamemnon, from having received this inheritance, and from being strong in his navy also at the same time to a greater extent than others, assembled and made the expedition not so much by favour as by fear.

1.9.4
47
φαίνεται γὰρ ναυσί τε πλείσταις αὐτὸς ἀφικόμενος καὶ Ἀρκάσι προσπαρασχών, ὡς Ὅμηρος τοῦτο δεδήλωκεν, εἴ τῳ ἱκανὸς τεκμηριῶσαι.
For he appears to have both come himself with most ships, and to have furnished them for the Arcadians besides; as Homer has also shown, if he is sufficient authority for any one.

1.9.4
48
καὶ ἐν τοῦ σκήπτρου ἅμα τῇ παραδόσει εἴρηκεν αὐτὸν πολλῇσι νήσοισι καὶ Ἄργεϊ παντὶ ἀνάσσειν.
And also, in [his account of] the transmission of the sceptre, he has mentioned that he "O'er numerous islands and all Argos ruled."

1.9.4
49
οὐκ ἂν οὖν νήσων ἔξω τῶν περιοικίδων (αὗται δὲ οὐκ ἂν πολλαὶ εἶεν) ἠπειρώτης ὢν ἐκράτει, εἰ μή τι καὶ ναυτικὸν εἶχεν.
Now, as he lived on the mainland, he would not have been master of islands, except those that were adjacent, (and those would not be numerous,) if he had not also had some naval force.

1.9.4
50
εἰκάζειν δὲ χρὴ καὶ ταύτῃ τῇ στρατείᾳ οἷα ἦν τὰ πρὸ αὐτῆς.
And we must conjecture by this expedition, what was the character of those before it.

1.10.1
51
καὶ ὅτι μὲν Μυκῆναι μικρὸν ἦν, ἢ εἴ τι τῶν τότε πόλισμα νῦν μὴ ἀξιόχρεων δοκεῖ εἶναι, οὐκ ἀκριβεῖ ἄν τις σημείῳ χρώμενος ἀπιστοίη μὴ γενέσθαι τὸν στόλον τοσοῦτον ὅσον οἵ τε ποιηταὶ εἰρήκασι καὶ ὁ λόγος κατέχει.
And as to Mycenae having been a small place, or if any town in those times appear now to be inconsiderable, this would be no certain proof to rest upon, for disbelieving that the armament was as large as the poets have said, and as report prevails.

1.10.2
52
Λακεδαιμονίων γὰρ εἰ ἡ πόλις ἐρημωθείη, λειφθείη δὲ τά τε ἱερὰ καὶ τῆς κατασκευῆς τὰ ἐδάφη, πολλὴν ἂν οἶμαι ἀπιστίαν τῆς δυνάμεως προελθόντος πολλοῦ χρόνου τοῖς ἔπειτα πρὸς τὸ κλέος αὐτῶν εἶναι (καίτοι Πελοποννήσου τῶν πέντε τὰς δύο μοίρας νέμονται, τῆς τε ξυμπάσης ἡγοῦνται καὶ τῶν ἔξω ξυμμάχων πολλῶν.
For if the city of the Lacedaemonians were laid desolate, and the temples and foundations of the public buildings were left, I think that when a long time had passed by, posterity would have great disbelief of their power in proportion to their fame. (And yet they occupy two of the five divisions of the Peloponnese, and take the lead of the whole of it, and of their allies out of it in great numbers.

1.10.2
53
ὅμως δὲ οὔτε ξυνοικισθείσης πόλεως οὔτε ἱεροῖς καὶ κατασκευαῖς πολυτελέσι χρησαμένης, κατὰ κώμας δὲ τῷ παλαιῷ τῆς Ἑλλάδος τρόπῳ οἰκισθείσης, φαίνοιτ’ ἂν ὑποδεεστέρα), Ἀθηναίων δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο παθόντων διπλασίαν ἂν τὴν δύναμιν εἰκάζεσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς φανερᾶς ὄψεως τῆς πόλεως ἢ ἔστιν.
Still, as the city is neither built closely, nor has sumptuous temples and public buildings, but is built in villages, after the old fashion of Greece, it would have an inferior appearance), whereas if the Athenians were to suffer the same fate, I think their power would be conjectured, from the appearance of the city to the eye, to have been double what it is.

1.10.3
54
οὔκουν ἀπιστεῖν εἰκός, οὐδὲ τὰς ὄψεις τῶν πόλεων μᾶλλον σκοπεῖν ἢ τὰς δυνάμεις, νομίζειν δὲ τὴν στρατείαν ἐκείνην μεγίστην μὲν γενέσθαι τῶν πρὸ αὑτῆς, λειπομένην δὲ τῶν νῦν, τῇ Ὁμήρου αὖ ποιήσει εἴ τι χρὴ καὶ ἐνταῦθα πιστεύειν, ἣν εἰκὸς ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον μὲν ποιητὴν ὄντα κοσμῆσαι, ὅμως δὲ φαίνεται καὶ οὕτως ἐνδεεστέρα.
Therefore, it's unlikely to be incredulous, nor should one focus more on the appearance of cities rather than their power. It should be considered that the expedition back then was the greatest of its time but falls short of those of the present. In this matter too, if one should trust Homer's poetry, it is expected that he, as a poet, would embellish the story, yet even so, it appears less impressive.

1.10.4
55
πεποίηκε γὰρ χιλίων καὶ διακοσίων νεῶν, τὰς μὲν Βοιωτῶν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν ἀνδρῶν, τὰς δὲ Φιλοκτήτου πεντήκοντα, δηλῶν, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, τὰς μεγίστας καὶ ἐλαχίστας·
For he has made it to consist of twelve hundred ships, those of the Boeotians carrying 120 men, and those of Philoctetes 50; meaning to show, as I think, the largest and the least.

1.10.4
56
ἄλλων γοῦν μεγέθους πέρι ἐν νεῶν καταλόγῳ οὐκ ἐμνήσθη.
At any rate he has made no mention of the size of any others in the catalogue of the ships.

1.10.4
57
αὐτερέται δὲ ὅτι ἦσαν καὶ μάχιμοι πάντες, ἐν ταῖς Φιλοκτήτου ναυσὶ δεδήλωκεν·
And that they all were themselves rowers and fighting men, he has shown in the case of the ships of Philoctetes.

1.10.4
58
τοξότας γὰρ πάντας πεποίηκε τοὺς προσκώπους.
For he has represented all the men at the oar as bowmen.

1.10.4
59
περίνεως δὲ οὐκ εἰκὸς πολλοὺς ξυμπλεῖν ἔξω τῶν βασιλέων καὶ τῶν μάλιστα ἐν τέλει, ἄλλως τε καὶ μέλλοντας πέλαγος περαιώσεσθαι μετὰ σκευῶν πολεμικῶν, οὐδ’ αὖ τὰ πλοῖα κατάφαρκτα ἔχοντας, ἀλλὰ τῷ παλαιῷ τρόπῳ λῃστικώτερον παρεσκευασμένα.
And it is not probable that many supernumeraries would sail with them, except the kings and highest officers; especially as they were going to cross the open sea with munitions of war; and, on the other hand, had not their vessels decked, but equipped, after the old fashion, more like privateers.

1.10.5
60
πρὸς τὰς μεγίστας δ’ οὖν καὶ ἐλαχίστας ναῦς τὸ μέσον σκοποῦντι οὐ πολλοὶ φαίνονται ἐλθόντες, ὡς ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς Ἑλλάδος κοινῇ πεμπόμενοι.
Looking then at the mean of the largest and the smallest ships, they do not appear to have gone in any great number, considering that they were sent by the whole of Greece in common.

1.11.1
61
αἴτιον δ’ ἦν ο

1.11.1
62
τῆς γὰρ τροφῆς ἀπορίᾳ τόν τε στρατὸν ἐλάσσω ἤγαγον καὶ ὅσον ἤλπιζον αὐτόθεν πολεμοῦντα βιοτεύσειν, ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἀφικόμενοι μάχῃ ἐκράτησαν (δῆλον δέ;
For owing to difficulty of subsistence, they took their army the smaller, and such only as they hoped would live on the country itself while carrying on the war; and when on their arrival they were superior in battle, (and that they were so is evident, for they would not else have built the fortification for their camp,)

1.11.1
63
τὸ γὰρ ἔρυμα τῷ στρατοπέδῳ οὐκ ἂν ἐτειχίσαντο), φαίνονται δ’ οὐδ’ ἐνταῦθα πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει χρησάμενοι, ἀλλὰ πρὸς γεωργίαν τῆς Χερσονήσου τραπόμενοι καὶ λῃστείαν τῆς τροφῆς ἀπορίᾳ.
they appear not even then to have employed all their force, but to have turned to the cultivation of the Chersonese, and to piracy, for want of food.

1.11.1
64
ᾗ καὶ μᾶλλον οἱ Τρῶες αὐτῶν διεσπαρμένων τὰ δέκα ἔτη ἀντεῖχον βίᾳ, τοῖς αἰεὶ ὑπολειπομένοις ἀντίπαλοι ὄντες.
And in this way the Trojans, owing to their being scattered, the more easily held out [*] by open force those ten years;

1.11.2
65
περιουσίαν δὲ εἰ ἦλθον ἔχοντες τροφῆς καὶ ὄντες ἁθρόοι ἄνευ λῃστείας καὶ γεωργίας ξυνεχῶς τὸν πόλεμον διέφερον , ῥᾳδίως ἂν μάχῃ κρατοῦντες εἷλον , οἵ γε καὶ οὐχ ἁθρόοι , ἀλλὰ μέρει τῷ αἰεὶ παρόντι ἀντεῖχον , πολιορκίᾳ δ’ ἂν προσκαθεζόμενοι ἐν ἐλάσσονί τε χρόνῳ καὶ ἀπονώτερον τὴν Τροίαν εἷλον .
But if they had gone with abundance of food, and in a body had continuously carried through the war, without foraging and agriculture, they would easily have conquered them in battle, and taken the place; since even though not united, but only with the part that was successively present, they held out against them. Now by pressing the siege, [I say,] they would have taken Troy both in less time and with less trouble.

1.11.2
66
ἀλλὰ δι’ ἀχρηματίαν τά τε πρὸ τούτων ἀσθενῆ ἦν καὶ αὐτά γε δὴ ταῦτα, ὀνομαστότατα τῶν πρὶν γενόμενα, δηλοῦται τοῖς ἔργοις ὑποδεέστερα ὄντα τῆς φήμης καὶ τοῦ νῦν περὶ αὐτῶν διὰ τοὺς ποιητὰς λόγου κατεσχηκότος.
But through want of money both the undertakings before this were weak, and this itself, though more famous than the former, is shown by facts to have been inferior to its fame, and to the present report of it, which has prevailed by means of the poets.

1.12.1
67
ἐπεὶ καὶ μετὰ τὰ Τρωικὰ ἡ Ἑλλὰς ἔτι μετανίστατό τε καὶ κατῳκίζετο, ὥστε μὴ ἡσυχάσασαν αὐξηθῆναι.
For even after the Trojan war Greece was still moving about and settling itself, so that it could not increase its power by remaining at rest.

1.12.2
68
ἥ τε γὰρ ἀναχώρησις τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐξ Ἰλίου χρονία γενομένη πολλὰ ἐνεόχμωσε,
and factions, generally speaking, arose in the states; in consequence of which men were expelled, and founded cities.

1.12.3
69
Βοιωτοί τε γὰρ οἱ νῦν ἑξηκοστῷ ἔτει μετὰ Ἰλίου ἅλωσιν ἐξ Ἄρνης ἀναστάντες ὑπὸ Θεσσαλῶν τὴν νῦν μὲν Βοιωτίαν, πρότερον δὲ Καδμηίδα γῆν καλουμένην ᾤκισαν

1.12.4
70
μόλις τε ἐν πολλῷ χρόνῳ ἡσυχάσασα ἡ Ἑλλὰς βεβαίως καὶ οὐκέτι ἀνισταμένη ἀποικίας ἐξέπεμψε, καὶ Ἴωνας μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ νησιωτῶν τοὺς πολλοὺς ᾤκισαν, Ἰταλίας δὲ καὶ Σικελίας τὸ πλεῖστον Πελοποννήσιοι τῆς τε ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος ἔστιν ἃ χωρία.
And Greece having with difficulty, after a long time, enjoyed settled peace, and being no longer subject to migrations, began to send out colonies; and the Athenians colonized Ionia, and most of the islands; and the Peloponnesians, the greater part of Italy and Sicily, and some places in the rest of Greece.

1.12.4
71
πάντα δὲ ταῦτα ὕστερον τῶν Τρωικῶν ἐκτίσθη.
But all these places were founded after the Trojan war.

1.13.1
72
δυνατωτέρας δὲ γιγνομένης τῆς Ἑλλάδος καὶ τῶν χρημάτων τὴν κτῆσιν ἔτι μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον ποιουμένης τὰ πολλὰ τυραννίδες ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι καθίσταντο, τῶν προσόδων μειζόνων γιγνομένων
Now when Greece was becoming more powerful, and acquiring possession of money still more than before, tyrannies, generally speaking, were established in the cities, from the revenues becoming greater;

1.13.2
73
πρῶτοι δὲ Κορίνθιοι λέγονται ἐγγύτατα τοῦ νῦν τρόπου μεταχειρίσαι τὰ περὶ τὰς ναῦς, καὶ τριήρεις ἐν Κορίνθῳ πρῶτον τῆς Ἑλλάδος ναυπηγηθῆναι.
Now the Corinthians are said first to have managed naval matters most nearly to the present fashion, and triremes to have been built at Corinth first in Greece.

1.13.3
74
φαίνεται δὲ καὶ Σαμίοις Ἀμεινοκλῆς Κορίνθιος ναυπηγὸς ναῦς ποιήσας τέσσαρας·
And Aminocles, a Corinthian shipwright, appears to have built four ships for the Samians also.

1.13.3
75
ἔτη δ’ ἐστὶ μάλιστα τριακόσια ἐς τὴν τελευτὴν τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου ὅτε Ἀμεινοκλῆς Σαμίοις ἦλθεν·
Now it is about three hundred years to the end of this war from the time that Aminocles went to the Samians;

1.13.4
76
ναυμαχία τε παλαιτάτη ὧν ἴσμεν γίγνεται Κορινθίων πρὸς Κερκυραίους·
and the most ancient sea-fight with which we are acquainted was fought between the Corinthians and the Corcyraeans.

1.13.4
77
ἔτη δὲ μάλιστα καὶ ταύτῃ ἑξήκοντα καὶ διακόσιά ἐστι μέχρι τοῦ αὐτοῦ χρόνου.
And from that too it is about two hundred and sixty years to the same period.

1.13.5
78
οἰκοῦντες γὰρ τὴν πόλιν οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἰσθμοῦ αἰεὶ δή ποτε ἐμπόριον εἶχον, τῶν Ἑλλήνων τὸ πάλαι κατὰ γῆν τὰ πλείω ἢ κατὰ θάλασσαν, τῶν τε ἐντὸς Πελοποννήσου καὶ τῶν ἔξω, διὰ τῆς ἐκείνων παρ’ ἀλλήλους ἐπιμισγόντων, χρήμασί τε δυνατοὶ ἦσαν, ὡς καὶ τοῖς παλαιοῖς ποιηταῖς δεδήλωται·
For the Corinthians, having their city situated on the isthmus, had always possessed an emporium; as the Greeks of old, both those within the Peloponnese and those without, had intercourse with each other by land more than by sea, through their country: and they were very rich, as is shown even by the old poets; for they gave the title of "wealthy" to the place.

1.13.5
79
ἀφνειὸν γὰρ ἐπωνόμασαν τὸ χωρίον.
For they named the place "wealthy".

1.13.5
80
ἐπειδή τε οἱ Ἕλληνες μᾶλλον ἔπλῳζον, τὰς ναῦς κτησάμενοι τὸ λῃστικὸν καθῄρουν, καὶ ἐμπόριον παρέχοντες ἀμφό

1.13.6
81
καὶ Ἴωσιν ὕστερον πολὺ γίγνεται ναυτικὸν ἐπὶ Κύρου Περσῶν πρώτου βασιλεύοντος καὶ Καμβύσου τοῦ υἱέος αὐτοῦ, τῆς τε καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς θαλάσσης Κύρῳ πολεμοῦντες ἐκράτησάν τινα χρόνον.
And the Ionians afterwards had a large navy in the time of Cyrus, the first king of the Persians, and Cambyses his son; and while at war with Cyrus, commanded the sea along their coast for some time.

1.13.6
82
καὶ Πολυκράτης Σάμου τυραννῶν ἐπὶ Καμβύσου ναυτικῷ ἰσχύων ἄλλας τε τῶν νήσων ὑπηκόους ἐποιήσατο καὶ Ῥήνειαν ἑλὼν ἀνέθηκε τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι τῷ Δηλίῳ.
Polycrates also, tyrant of Samos, in the time of Cambyses, having a strong fleet, both made some other of the islands subject to him, and took Rhenea and dedicated it to the Delian Apollo.

1.13.6
83
Φωκαῆς τε Μασσαλίαν οἰκίζοντες Καρχηδονίους ἐνίκων ναυμαχοῦντες·
And the Phocaeans, while founding Massalia, conquered the Carthaginians in a sea-fight.

1.14.1
84
δυνατώτατα γὰρ ταῦτα τῶν ναυτικῶν ἦν.
These were the strongest of their navies.

1.14.1
85
φαίνεται δὲ καὶ ταῦτα πολλαῖς γενεαῖς ὕστερα γενόμενα τῶν Τρωικῶν τριήρεσι μὲν ὀλίγαις χρώμενα, πεντηκοντόροις δ’ ἔτι καὶ πλοίοις μακροῖς ἐξηρτυμένα ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνα.
But even these, though many generations after the Trojan war, appear to have used but few triremes, and to have been still fitted out with fifty-oared vessels, and long boats, as that fleet was.

1.14.2
86
ὀλίγον τε πρὸ τῶν Μηδικῶν καὶ τοῦ Δαρείου θανάτου, ὃς μετὰ Καμβύσην Περσῶν ἐβασίλευσε, τριήρεις περί τε Σικελίαν τοῖς τυράννοις ἐς πλῆθος ἐγένοντο καὶ Κερκυραίοις·
And it was but a short time before the Median war, and the death of Darius, who was king of the Persians after Cambyses, that triremes were possessed in any number by the tyrants of Sicily and the Corcyraeans.

1.14.2
87
ταῦτα γὰρ τελευταῖα πρὸ τῆς Ξέρξου στρατείας ναυτικὰ ἀξιόλογα ἐν τῇ Ἑλλάδι κατέστη·
For these were the last navies worth mentioning established in Greece before the expedition of Xerxes.

1.14.3
88
Αἰγινῆται γὰρ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι, καὶ εἴ τινες ἄλλοι, βραχέα ἐκέκτηντο, καὶ τούτων τὰ πολλὰ πεντηκοντόρους·
as the Aeginetans and Athenians, and whoever else had any, possessed but small ones, and of those the greater part fifty-oared vessels;

1.14.3
89
ὀψέ τε ἀφ’ οὗ Ἀθηναίους Θεμιστοκλῆς ἔπεισεν Αἰγινήταις πολεμοῦντας, καὶ ἅμα τοῦ βαρβάρου προσδοκίμου ὄντος, τὰς ναῦς ποιήσασθαι αἷσπερ καὶ ἐναυμάχησαν·
and it was only lately that Themistocles persuaded the Athenians, when at war with the Aeginetans, and when the barbarian was also expected, to build those very ships with which they fought him by sea;

1.14.3
90
καὶ αὗται οὔπω εἶχον διὰ πάσης καταστρώματα·
and these were not yet decked throughout.

1.15.1
91
τὰ μὲν οὖν ναυτικὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων τοιαῦτα ἦν, τά τε παλαιὰ καὶ τὰ ὕστερον γενόμενα·
Of such a [deficient] character then were the navies of the Greeks, both the ancient ones and those which were built afterwards.

1.15.1
92
ἰσχὺν δὲ περιεποιήσαντο ὅμως οὐκ ἐλαχίστην οἱ προσσχόντες αὐτοῖς χρημάτων τε προσόδῳ καὶ ἄλλων ἀρχῇ·
And yet those who paid attention to them obtained the greatest power, both by income of money and dominion over others:

1.15.1
93
ἐπιπλέοντες γὰρ τὰς νήσους κατεστρέφοντο, καὶ μάλιστα ὅσοι μὴ διαρκῆ εἶχον χώραν·
for they sailed against the islands, and subdued them; especially those who had not sufficient extent of country.

1.15.2
94
κατὰ γῆν δὲ πόλεμος, ὅθεν τις καὶ δύναμις παρεγένετο, οὐδεὶς ξυνέστη·
But as for war by land, from which any power [*] was acquired, there was none.

1.15.2
95
πάντες δὲ ἦσαν, ὅσοι καὶ ἐγένοντο, πρὸς ὁμόρους τοὺς σφετέρους ἑκάστοις, καὶ ἐκδήμους στρατείας πολὺ ἀπὸ τῆς ἑαυτῶν ἐπ’ ἄλλων καταστροφῇ οὐκ ἐξῇσαν οἱ Ἕλληνες·
Such as did arise, were all against their several neighbours; and the Greeks did not go out in any foreign expeditions far from their country for the subjugation of others.

1.15.2
96
οὐ γὰρ ξυνειστήκεσαν πρὸς τὰς μεγίστας πόλεις ὑπήκοοι, οὐδ’ αὖ αὐτοὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἴσης κοινὰς στρατείας ἐποιοῦντο, κατ’ ἀλλήλους δὲ μᾶλλον ὡς ἕκαστοι οἱ ἀστυγείτονες ἐπολέμουν·
For they had not ranged themselves with the chief states as subjects; nor, on the other hand, did they of their own accord, on fair and equal terms, make common expeditions; but it was rather neighbouring states that separately waged war upon each other.

1.15.3
97
μάλιστα δὲ ἐς τὸν πάλαι ποτὲ γενόμενον πόλεμον Χαλκιδέων καὶ Ἐρετριῶν καὶ τὸ ἄλλο Ἑλληνικὸν ἐς ξυμμαχίαν ἑκατέρων διέστη·
But it was for the war carried on at an early period between the Chalcidians and Eretrians, that the rest of Greece also was most generally divided in alliance with one side or the other.

1.16.1
98
ἐπεγένετο δὲ ἄλλοις τε ἄλλοθι κωλύματα μὴ αὐξηθῆναι, καὶ Ἴωσι προχωρησάντων ἐπὶ μέγα τῶν πραγμάτων Κῦρος καὶ ἡ Περσικὴ βασιλεία Κροῖσον καθελοῦσα καὶ ὅσα ἐντὸς Ἅλυος ποταμοῦ πρὸς θάλασσαν ἐπεστράτευσε καὶ τὰς ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ πόλεις ἐδούλωσε, Δαρεῖός τε ὕστερον τῷ Φοινίκων ναυτικῷ κρατῶν καὶ τὰς νήσους.
Now to others there arose in other ways obstacles to their increase; and in the case of the Ionians, when their power had advanced to a high pitch, Cyrus and the Persian kingdom, having subdued Croesus and all within the Halys to the sea, marched against them, and reduced to bondage their cities on the mainland, as Darius afterwards did even the islands, conquering them by means of the fleet of the Phoenicians.

1.17.1
99
τύραννοί τε ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐν ταῖς Ἑλληνικαῖς πόλεσι, τὸ ἐφ’ ἑαυτῶν μόνον προορώμενοι ἔς τε τὸ σῶμα καὶ ἐς τὸ τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον αὔξειν δι’ ἀσφαλείας ὅσον ἐδύναντο μάλιστα τὰς πόλεις ᾤκουν, ἐπράχθη δὲ οὐδὲν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἔργον ἀξιόλογον, εἰ μὴ εἴ τι πρὸς περιοίκους τοὺς αὐτῶν ἑκάστοις.
As for the tyrants, such as there were in the Grecian cities, since they provided only for what concerned themselves, with a view to the safety of their own persons, and the aggrandizement of their own family, they governed their cities with caution, as far as they possibly could; and nothing memorable was achieved by them; [indeed nothing,] except it might be against their own several border states.

1.17.1
100
οἱ γὰρ ἐν Σικελίᾳ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐχώρησαν δυνάμεως.
[I speak of those in old Greece,] for those in Sicily advanced to a very great degree of power.

1.17.1
101
οὕτω πανταχόθεν ἡ Ἑλλὰς ἐπὶ πολὺν χρόνον κατείχετο μήτε κοινῇ φανερὸν μηδὲν κατεργάζεσθαι, κα

1.18.1
102
ἐπειδὴ δὲ οἵ τε Ἀθηναίων τύραννοι καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος ἐπὶ πολὺ καὶ πρὶν τυραννευθείσης οἱ πλεῖστοι καὶ τελευταῖοι πλὴν τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων κατελύθησαν (ἡ γὰρ Λακεδαίμων μετὰ τὴν κτίσιν τῶν νῦν ἐνοικούντων αὐτὴν Δωριῶν ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ὧν ἴσμεν χρόνον στασιάσασα ὅμως ἐκ παλαιτάτου καὶ ηὐνομήθη καὶ αἰεὶ ἀτυράννευτος ἦν; ἔτη γάρ ἐστι μάλιστα τετρακόσια καὶ ὀλίγῳ πλείω ἐς τὴν τελευτὴν τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου ἀφ’ οὗ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τῇ αὐτῇ πολιτείᾳ χρῶνται, καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ δυνάμενοι καὶ τὰ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις πόλεσι καθίστασαν),
But after the tyrants of the Athenians and those in the rest of Greece, (which even at an earlier period [*] was for a long time subject to tyrants,) the most and last, excepting those in Sicily, had been deposed by the Lacedaemonians; (for Lacedaemon, after the settlement of the Dorians who now inhabit it, though torn by factions for the longest time of any country that we are acquainted with, yet from the earliest period enjoyed good laws, and was always free from tyrants; for it is about four hundred years, or a little more, to the end of this war, that the Lacedaemonians have been in possession of the same form of government; and being for this reason powerful, they settled matters in the other states also;)

1.18.1
103
μετὰ δὲ τὴν τῶν τυράννων κατάλυσιν ἐκ τῆς Ἑλλάδος οὐ πολλοῖς ἔτεσιν ὕστερον καὶ ἡ ἐν Μαραθῶνι μάχη Μήδων πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ἐγένετο.
after, [*] I say, the deposition of the tyrants in the rest of Greece, not many years subsequently the battle of Marathon was fought between the Medes and Athenians.

1.18.2
104
δεκάτῳ δὲ ἔτει μετ’ αὐτὴν αὖθις ὁ βάρβαρος τῷ μεγάλῳ στόλῳ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα δουλωσόμενος ἦλθεν.
In the tenth year after that, the barbarian again came with his great armament against Greece, intending to enslave it.

1.18.2
105
καὶ μεγάλου κινδύνου ἐπικρεμασθέντος οἵ τε Λακεδαιμόνιοι τῶν ξυμπολεμησάντων Ἑλλήνων ἡγήσαντο δυνάμει προύχοντες, καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπιόντων τῶν Μήδων διανοηθέντες ἐκλιπεῖν τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἀνασκευασάμενοι ἐς τὰς ναῦς ἐσβάντες ναυτικοὶ ἐγένοντο.
And when a great danger was impending, the Lacedaemonians, being the most powerful, took the lead of the Greeks who had joined in the war, and the Athenians, anticipating the approach of the Medes, decided to abandon their city and, having embarked on their ships, became a naval people.

1.18.2
106
κοινῇ τε ἀπωσάμενοι τὸν βάρβαρον, ὕστερον οὐ πολλῷ διεκρίθησαν πρός τε Ἀθηναίους καὶ Λακεδαιμονίους οἵ τε ἀποστάντες βασιλέως Ἕλληνες καὶ οἱ ξυμπολεμήσαντες.
After jointly repelling the barbarian, not long after, a division arose between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, involving both the Greeks who had revolted from the king and those who had fought together.

1.18.2
107
δυνάμει γὰρ ταῦτα μέγιστα διεφάνη.
For these states emerged as the greatest in power.

1.18.2
108
ἴσχυον γὰρ οἱ μὲν κατὰ γῆν, οἱ δὲ ναυσίν.
The one was strong by land, the other by sea.

1.18.3
109
καὶ ὀλίγον μὲν χρόνον ξυνέμεινεν ἡ ὁμαιχμία, ἔπειτα διενεχθέντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπολέμησαν μετὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων πρὸς ἀλλήλους.
For a short time, the alliance held together, but then the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, having become estranged, waged war against each other with their allies.

1.18.3
110
καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Ἑλλήνων εἴ τινές που διασταῖεν, πρὸς τούτους ἤδη ἐχώρουν.
And if any of the other Greeks were at odds anywhere, they now sided with these.

1.18.3
111
ὥστε ἀπὸ τῶν Μηδικῶν ἐς τόνδε αἰεὶ τὸν πόλεμον τὰ μὲν σπενδόμενοι, τὰ δὲ πολεμοῦντες ἢ ἀλλήλοις ἢ τοῖς ἑαυτῶν ξυμμάχοις ἀφισταμένοις εὖ παρεσκευάσαντο τὰ πολέμια καὶ ἐμπειρότεροι ἐγένοντο μετὰ κινδύνων τὰς μελέτας ποιούμενοι.
Therefore, from the Persian wars to this war, sometimes making peace and at other times waging war, either with each other or with their own revolting allies, they well prepared for war and became more experienced, conducting their drills amidst dangers.

1.19.1
112
καὶ οἱ μὲν Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὐχ ὑποτελεῖς ἔχοντες φόρου τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἡγοῦντο, κατ’ ὀλιγαρχίαν δὲ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς μόνον ἐπιτηδείως ὅπως πολιτεύσουσι θεραπεύοντες.
The Lacedaemonians, not treating their allies as tributaries, led them, paying attention only to governing by oligarchy in their own interest.

1.19.1
113
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ναῦς τε τῶν πόλεων τῷ χρόνῳ παραλαβόντες πλὴν Χίων καὶ Λεσβίων, καὶ χρήματα τοῖς πᾶσι τάξαντες φέρειν.
The Athenians, however, having in time taken ships from the states, except Chios and Lesbos, and having imposed a tribute of money on all.

1.20.1
114
τὰ μὲν οὖν παλαιὰ τοιαῦτα ηὗρον, χαλεπὰ ὄντα παντὶ ἑξῆς τεκμηρίῳ πιστεῦσαι.
Thus, I found the early state of things to be, though it is difficult to trust every successive proof.

1.20.1
115
οἱ γὰρ ἄνθρωποι τὰς ἀκοὰς τῶν προγεγενημένων, καὶ ἢν ἐπιχώρια σφίσιν ᾖ, ὁμοίως ἀβασανίστως παρ’ ἀλλήλων δέχονται.
For men receive reports of past events, even if they concern their own country, without examination from each other.

1.20.2
116
Ἀθηναίων γοῦν τὸ πλῆθος Ἵππαρχον οἴονται ὑφ’ Ἁρμοδίου καὶ Ἀριστογείτονος τύραννον ὄντα ἀποθανεῖν, καὶ οὐκ ἴσασιν ὅτι Ἱππίας μὲν πρεσβύτατος ὢν ἦρχε τῶν Πεισιστράτου υἱέων, Ἵππαρχος δὲ καὶ Θεσσαλὸς ἀδελφοὶ ἦσαν αὐτοῦ.
For instance, most Athenians believe that Hipparchus was a tyrant when he was killed by Harmodius and Aristogeiton, not knowing that Hippias, being the eldest of Pisistratus' sons, was in power, and Hipparchus and Thessalus were his brothers.

1.20.3
117
πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὄντα καὶ οὐ χρόνῳ ἀμνηστούμε

1.20.3
118
οὕτως ἀταλαίπωρος τοῖς πολλοῖς ἡ ζήτησις τῆς ἀληθείας, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἑτοῖμα μᾶλλον τρέπονται.
Thus, the search for truth is often neglected by most, and they tend to turn more towards readily available information.

1.21.1
119
ἐκ δὲ τῶν εἰρημένων τεκμηρίων ὅμως τοιαῦτα ἄν τις νομίζων μάλιστα ἃ διῆλθον οὐχ ἁμαρτάνοι, καὶ οὔτε ὡς ποιηταὶ ὑμνήκασι περὶ αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον κοσμοῦντες μᾶλλον πιστεύων, οὔτε ὡς λογογράφοι ξυνέθεσαν ἐπὶ τὸ προσαγωγότερον τῇ ἀκροάσει ἢ ἀληθέστερον, ὄντα ἀνεξέλεγκτα καὶ τὰ πολλὰ ὑπὸ χρόνου αὐτῶν ἀπίστως ἐπὶ τὸ μυθῶδες ἐκνενικηκότα, ηὑρῆσθαι δὲ ἡγησάμενος ἐκ τῶν ἐπιφανεστάτων σημείων ὡς παλαιὰ εἶναι ἀποχρώντως.
However, from the mentioned proofs, if one were to suppose that things were generally as I have described them, he would not be mistaken. He should neither believe as the poets have glorified them in exaggeration, nor as historians have composed, in a more appealing but less truthful manner, their subjects being unverifiable and often becoming incredible due to the passage of time, having reached mythical proportions. But, considering from the most prominent signs, one would rightly ascertain their antiquity.

1.21.2
120
καὶ ὁ πόλεμος οὗτος, καίπερ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐν ᾧ μὲν ἂν πολεμῶσι τὸν παρόντα αἰεὶ μέγιστον κρινόντων, παυσαμένων δὲ τὰ ἀρχαῖα μᾶλλον θαυμαζόντων, ἀπ’ αὐτῶν τῶν ἔργων σκοποῦσι δηλώσει ὅμως μείζων γεγενημένος αὐτῶν.
This war, although people always regard the war they are fighting as the greatest at the time, and admire past wars once they have ended, will still prove to have been greater in reality from the facts themselves.

1.22.1
121
καὶ ὅσα μὲν λόγῳ εἶπον ἕκαστοι ἢ μέλλοντες πολεμήσειν ἢ ἐν αὐτῷ ἤδη ὄντες, χαλεπὸν τὴν ἀκρίβειαν αὐτὴν τῶν λεχθέντων διαμνημονεῦσαι ἦν ἐμοί τε ὧν αὐτὸς ἤκουσα καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοθέν ποθεν ἐμοὶ ἀπαγγέλλουσιν.
It was difficult to remember with accuracy what each side said either when preparing for war or when already in it, both for me with what I heard myself and for others reporting to me from various sources.

1.22.1
122
ὡς δ’ ἂν ἐδόκουν ἐμοὶ ἕκαστοι περὶ τῶν αἰεὶ παρόντων τὰ δέοντα μάλιστ’ εἰπεῖν, ἐχομένῳ ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τῆς ξυμπάσης γνώμης τῶν ἀληθῶς λεχθέντων, οὕτως εἴρηται.
I have recorded the speeches as I thought each party would most likely have spoken about the matters at hand, staying as close as possible to the overall intent of what was actually said.

1.22.2
123
τὰ δ’ ἔργα τῶν πραχθέντων ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ παρατυχόντος πυνθανόμενος ἠξίωσα γράφειν, οὐδ’ ὡς ἐμοὶ ἐδόκει, ἀλλ’ οἷς τε αὐτὸς παρῆν καὶ παρὰ τῶν ἄλλων ὅσον δυνατὸν ἀκριβείᾳ περὶ ἑκάστου ἐπεξελθών.
Regarding the actions that occurred in the war, I did not consider it appropriate to write from mere hearsay or as it seemed to me, but from what I myself witnessed and from others, investigating each event as accurately as possible.

1.22.3
124
ἐπιπόνως δὲ ηὑρίσκετο, διότι οἱ παρόντες τοῖς ἔργοις ἑκάστοις οὐ τ- αὐτὰ περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν ἔλεγον, ἀλλ’ ὡς ἑκατέρων τις εὐνοίας ἢ μνήμης ἔχοι.
It was arduous to ascertain the truth because those present at each event did not all report the same thing, but as each might be biased or remember differently.

1.22.4
125
καὶ ἐς μὲν ἀκρόασιν ἴσως τὸ μὴ μυθῶδες αὐτῶν ἀτερπέστερον φανεῖται.
For listening, the non-mythical nature of these accounts might seem less entertaining.

1.22.4
126
ὅσοι δὲ βουλήσονται τῶν τε γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς σκοπεῖν καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ποτὲ αὖθις κατὰ τὸ ἀνθρώπινον τοιούτων καὶ παραπλησίων ἔσεσθαι, ὠφέλιμα κρίνειν αὐτὰ ἀρκούντως ἕξει.
Those who wish to understand clearly what has happened and what will happen again in similar and approximate circumstances according to human nature will find these accounts sufficiently useful.

1.22.4
127
κτῆμά τε ἐς αἰεὶ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀγώνισμα ἐς τὸ παραχρῆμα ἀκούειν ξύγκειται.
This is composed as a lasting possession rather than as a competition to be heard at the moment.

1.23.1
128
τῶν δὲ πρότερον ἔργων μέγιστον ἐπράχθη τὸ Μηδικόν, καὶ τοῦτο ὅμως δυοῖν ναυμαχίαιν καὶ πεζομαχίαιν ταχεῖαν τὴν κρίσιν ἔσχεν.
Of previous events, the greatest was the Persian War, which nevertheless was quickly decided by two naval and two land battles.

1.23.1
129
τούτου δὲ τοῦ πολέμου μῆκός τε μέγα προύβη, παθήματά τε ξυνηνέχθη γενέσθαι ἐν αὐτῷ τῇ Ἑλλάδι οἷα οὐχ ἕτερα ἐν ἴσῳ χρόνῳ.
But this war had a great duration and brought together such calamities in Greece as never occurred in an equal period of time.

1.23.2
130
οὔτε γὰρ πόλεις τοσαίδε ληφθεῖσαι ἠρημώθησαν, αἱ μὲν ὑπὸ βαρβάρων, αἱ δ’ ὑπὸ σφῶν αὐτῶν ἀντιπολεμούντων (εἰσὶ δ’ αἳ καὶ οἰκήτορας μετέβαλον ἁλισκόμεναι), οὔτε φυγαὶ τοσαίδε ἀνθρώπων καὶ φόνος, ὁ μὲν κατ’ αὐτὸν τὸν πόλεμον, ὁ δὲ διὰ τὸ στασιάζειν.
For so many cities were never before captured and laid waste, some by barbarians, others by their own countrymen at war; some even changed inhabitants upon being taken. Nor were there so many exiles and such slaughter of people, both during the war and due to internal strife.

1.23.3
131
τά τε πρότερον ἀκοῇ μὲν λεγόμενα, ἔργῳ δὲ σπανιώτερον βεβαιούμενα οὐκ ἄπιστα κατέστη, σεισμῶν τε πέρι, οἳ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἅμα μέρος γῆς καὶ ἰσχυρότατοι οἱ αὐτοὶ ἐπέσχον, ἡλίου τε ἐκλείψεις, αἳ πυκνότεραι παρὰ τὰ ἐκ τοῦ πρὶν χρόνου μνημονευόμενα ξυνέβησαν, αὐχμοί τε ἔστι παρ’ οἷς μεγάλοι καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν καὶ λιμοὶ καὶ ἡ οὐχ ἥκιστα βλάψασα καὶ μέρος τι φθείρασα ἡ λοιμώδης νόσος.
What was previously mentioned in hearsay but less frequently confirmed by action became credible, including earthquakes affecting a vast part of the earth, most violently at the same time, solar eclipses more frequent than before recorded, severe droughts in some regions leading to famines, and the devastating and partly destructive plague.

1.23.3
132
ταῦτα γὰρ πάντα μετὰ τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου ἅμα ξυνεπέθετο.
All these events coincided with this war.

1.23.4
133
ἤρξαντο δὲ αὐτοῦ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Πελοποννήσιοι λύσαντες τὰς τριακοντούτεις σπονδὰς αἳ αὐτοῖς ἐγένοντο μετὰ Εὐβοίας ἅλωσιν.
The war was initiated by the Athenians and Peloponnesians, breaking the thirty years' truce following the capture of Euboea.

1.23.5
134
διότι δ’ ἔλυσαν, τὰς αἰτίας προύγραψα πρῶτον καὶ τὰς διαφοράς, τοῦ μή τινα ζητῆσαί ποτε ἐξ ὅτου τοσοῦτος πόλεμος τοῖς Ἕλλησι κατέστη.
The reasons for breaking the truce were detailed earlier, including their differences, to avoid the need to investigate the origins of such a great war among the Greeks.

1.23.6
135
τὴν μὲν γὰρ ἀληθεστάτην πρόφασιν, ἀφανεστάτην δὲ λόγῳ, τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἡγοῦμαι μεγάλους γιγνομένους καὶ φόβον παρέχοντας τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἀναγκάσαι ἐς τὸ πολεμεῖν.
For the truest reason, though least brought forward in words, I consider to have been that the Athenians, becoming great and causing fear to the Lacedaemonians, compelled them to go to war.

1.23.6
136
αἱ δ’ ἐς τὸ φανερὸν λεγόμεναι αἰτίαι αἵδ’ ἦσαν ἑκατέρων, ἀφ’ ὧν λύσαντες τὰς σπονδὰς ἐς τὸν πόλεμον κατέστησαν.
The causes openly alleged by both sides, which led to the breaking of the truce and the onset of war, were as follows:

1.24.1
137
Ἐπίδαμνός ἐστι πόλις ἐν δεξιᾷ ἐσπλέοντι ἐς τὸν Ἰόνιον κόλπον.
Epidamnos is a city on the right as you sail into the Ionian Gulf.

1.24.1
138
προσοικοῦσι δ’ αὐτὴν Ταυλάντιοι βάρβαροι, Ἰλλυρικὸν ἔθνος.
It is neighbored by the Taulantii, a barbarian people of Illyria.

1.24.2
139
ταύτην ἀπῴκισαν μὲν Κερκυραῖοι, οἰκιστὴς δ’ ἐγένετο Φαλίος Ἐρατοκλείδου Κορίνθιος γένος τῶν ἀφ’ Ἡρακλέους, κατὰ δὴ τὸν παλαιὸν νόμον ἐκ τῆς μητροπόλεως κατακληθείς.
The city was colonized by the Corcyraeans, and Phalius, the son of Eratoclides, a Corinthian of Heraclidae lineage, was chosen to lead the colony, according to the ancient custom, by the mother city.

1.24.2
140
ξυνῴκισαν δὲ καὶ Κορινθίων τινὲς καὶ τοῦ ἄλλου Δωρικοῦ γένους.
Some Corinthians and others of the Doric race also joined in establishing the colony.

1.24.3
141
προελθόντος δὲ τοῦ χρόνου ἐγένετο ἡ τῶν Ἐπιδαμνίων δύναμις μεγάλη καὶ πολυάνθρωπος.
In time, Epidamnus grew in strength and population.

1.24.4
142
στασιάσαντες δὲ ἐν ἀλλήλοις ἔτη πολλά, ὡς λέγεται, ἀπὸ πολέμου τινὸς τῶν προσοίκων βαρβάρων ἐφθάρησαν καὶ τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς πολλῆς ἐστερήθησαν.
After many years of internal strife, as it is said, following a war with neighboring barbarians, they were greatly weakened and lost much of their power.

1.24.5
143
τὰ δὲ τελευταῖα πρὸ τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου ὁ δῆμος αὐτῶν ἐξεδίωξε τοὺς δυνατούς, οἱ δὲ ἐπελθόντες μετὰ τῶν βαρβάρων ἐλῄζοντο τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει κατά τε γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν.
Before this war, the common people of Epidamnus had expelled the powerful; those expelled, joining forces with barbarians, were raiding those in the city by land and sea.

1.24.6
144
οἱ δὲ ἐν τῇ πόλει ὄντες Ἐπιδάμνιοι ἐπειδὴ ἐπιέζοντο, πέμπουσιν ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν πρέσβεις ὡς μητρόπολιν οὖσαν, δεόμενοι μὴ σφᾶς περιορᾶν φθειρομένους, ἀλλὰ τούς τε φεύγοντας ξυναλλάξαι σφίσι καὶ τὸν τῶν βαρβάρων πόλεμον καταλῦσαι.
The Epidamnians in the city, under pressure, sent ambassadors to Corcyra, their mother-city, pleading not to be abandoned to destruction, but for reconciliation with the exiles and to put an end to the war with the barbarians.

1.24.7
145
ταῦτα δὲ ἱκέται καθεζόμενοι ἐς τὸ Ἥραιον ἐδέοντο.
As suppliants, they made these requests, sitting in the temple of Hera.

1.24.7
146
οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι τὴν ἱκετείαν οὐκ ἐδέξαντο, ἀλλ’ ἀπράκτους ἀπέπεμψαν.
However, the Corcyraeans did not accept their supplication and dismissed them without action.

1.25.1
147
γνόντες δὲ οἱ Ἐπιδάμνιοι οὐδεμίαν σφίσιν ἀπὸ Κερκύρας τιμωρίαν οὖσαν ἐν ἀπόρῳ εἴχοντο θέσθαι τὸ παρόν, καὶ πέμψαντες ἐς Δελφοὺς τὸν θεὸν ἐπήροντο εἰ παραδοῖεν Κορινθίοις τὴν πόλιν ὡς οἰκισταῖς καὶ τιμωρίαν τινὰ πειρῷντ’ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ποιεῖσθαι.
Recognizing no assistance from Corcyra, the Epidamnians were uncertain about their current situation. They sent to Delphi to inquire if they should surrender their city to the Corinthians as founders and seek some redress from them.

1.25.1
148
ὁ δ’ αὐτοῖς ἀνεῖλε παραδοῦναι καὶ ἡγεμόνας ποιεῖσθαι.
The oracle instructed them to surrender and appoint leaders.

1.25.2
149
ἐλθόντες δὲ οἱ Ἐπιδάμνιοι ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον κατὰ τὸ μαντεῖον παρέδοσαν τὴν ἀποικίαν, τόν τε οἰκιστὴν ἀποδεικνύντες σφῶν ἐκ Κορίνθου ὄντα καὶ τὸ χρηστήριον δηλοῦντες, ἐδέοντό τε μὴ σφᾶς περιορᾶν φθειρομένους, ἀλλ’ ἐπαμῦναι.
The Epidamnians came to Corinth, as per the oracle's guidance, and handed over their colony, showing that their founder was from Corinth and referring to the oracle. They pleaded not to be ignored in their destruction but to be defended.

1.25.3
150
Κορίνθιοι δὲ κατά τε τὸ δίκαιον ὑπεδέξαντο τὴν τιμωρίαν, νομίζοντες οὐχ ἧσσον ἑαυτῶν εἶναι τὴν ἀποικίαν ἢ Κερκυραίων, ἅμα δὲ καὶ μίσει τῶν Κερκυραίων, ὅτι αὐτῶν παρημέλουν ὄντες ἄποικοι.
And the Corinthians undertook their defence, both on the ground of equity, (as thinking the colony no less their own than the Corcyraeans',) and also for hatred of the Corcyraeans; because, although they were their colony, they slighted them.

1.25.4
151
οὔτε γὰρ ἐν πανηγύρεσι ταῖς κοιναῖς διδόντες γέρα τὰ νομιζόμενα οὔτε Κορινθίῳ ἀνδρὶ προκαταρχόμενοι τῶν ἱερῶν ὥσπερ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀποικίαι.
For they neither gave to them the customary privileges in their general religious assemblies, nor to any individual Corinthian, when performing the initiatory rites of sacrifice, as their other colonies did.

1.25.4
152
περιφρονοῦντες δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ χρημάτων δυνάμει ὄντες κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον ὁμοῖα τοῖς Ἑλλήνων πλουσιωτάτοις καὶ τῇ ἐς πόλεμον παρασκευῇ δυνατώτεροι, ναυτικῷ δὲ καὶ πολὺ προύχειν.
But despised them, as they were both equal in wealth to the very richest of the Greeks at that time, and more powerful in resources for war, and sometimes prided themselves on being even very far superior in their fleet.

1.26.1
153
πάντων οὖν τούτων ἐγκλήματα ἔχοντες οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἔπεμπον ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον ἄσμενοι τὴν ὠφελίαν, οἰκήτορά τε τὸν βουλόμενον ἰέναι κελεύοντες καὶ Ἀμπρακιωτῶν καὶ Λευκαδίων καὶ ἑαυτῶν φρουρούς.
The Corinthians therefore, having complaints against them for all these things, gladly proceeded to send the aid to Epidamnus, not only telling whosoever would to go and dwell there, but also sending a garrison of Ambraciots, Leucadians, and their own citizens.

1.26.2
154
ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ πεζῇ ἐς Ἀπολλωνίαν, Κορινθίων οὖσαν ἀποικίαν, δέει τῶν Κερκυραίων μὴ κωλύωνται ὑπ’ αὐτῶν κατὰ θάλασσαν περαιούμενοι.
Which succours marched by land to Apollonia, a colony of the Corinthians, for fear of the Corcyraeans, lest they should be hindered by them in their passage by sea.

1.26.3
155
Κερκυραῖοι δὲ ἐπειδὴ ᾔσθοντο τούς τε οἰκήτορας καὶ φρουροὺς ἥκοντας ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον τήν τε ἀποικίαν Κορινθίοις δεδομένην, ἐχαλέπαινον.
The Corcyraeans, on finding that the settlers and the garrison were come to Epidamnus, and that the colony was delivered up to the Corinthians, were very angry.

1.26.3
156
καὶ πλεύσαντες εὐθὺς πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι ναυσὶ καὶ ὕστερον ἑτέρῳ στόλῳ τούς τε φεύγοντας ἐκέλευον κατ’ ἐπήρειαν δέχεσθαι αὐτούς (ἦλθον γὰρ ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν οἱ τῶν Ἐπιδαμνίων φυγάδες, τάφους τε ἀποδεικνύντες καὶ ξυγγένειαν, ἣν προϊσχόμενοι ἐδέοντο σφᾶς κατάγειν) τούς τε φρουροὺς οὓς Κορίνθιοι ἔπεμψαν καὶ τοὺς οἰκήτορας ἀποπέμπειν.
And sailing immediately thither with twenty-five ships, and afterwards with another fleet, they commanded them, by way of insult, both to recall those whom they had banished (for the exiles of the Epidamnians had come to Corcyra, pointing out the sepulchres of their ancestors and their kindred to them, on the plea of which they begged that they would restore them), and to dismiss the garrison sent thither by the Corinthians and the settlers.

1.26.4
157
οἱ δὲ Ἐπιδάμνιοι οὐδὲν αὐτῶν ὑπήκουσαν, ἀλλὰ στρατεύουσιν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ Κερκυραῖοι τεσσαράκοντα ναυσὶ μετὰ τῶν φυγάδων ὡς κατάξοντες, καὶ τοὺς Ἰλλυριοὺς προσλαβόντες.
The Epidamnians did not comply with any of these demands. In response, the Corcyraeans, along with forty ships and the banished Epidamnians, prepared to attack them, also enlisting the aid of the Illyrians.

1.26.5
158
προσκαθεζόμενοι δὲ τὴν πόλιν προεῖπον Ἐπιδαμνίων τε τὸν βουλόμενον καὶ τοὺς ξένους ἀπαθεῖς ἀπιέναι .
Once they had besieged the city, they allowed any Epidamnians and strangers who wished to leave to do so safely.

1.26.5
159
εἰ δὲ μή, ὡς πολεμίοις χρήσεσθαι.
They declared that anyone who chose not to leave would be treated as an enemy.

1.26.5
160
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἐπείθοντο, οἱ μὲν Κερκυραῖοι (ἔστι δ’ ἰσθμὸς τὸ χωρίον) ἐπολιόρκουν τὴν πόλιν,
Since the Epidamnians refused to comply, the Corcyraeans, considering the location an isthmus, proceeded to besiege the city.

1.27.1
161
Κορίνθιοι δ’, ὡς αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῆς Ἐπιδάμνου ἦλθον ἄγγελοι ὅτι πολιορκοῦνται, παρεσκευάζοντο στρατείαν, καὶ ἅμα ἀποικίαν ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον ἐκήρυσσον ἐπὶ τῇ ἴσῃ καὶ ὁμοίᾳ τὸν βουλόμενον ἰέναι .
When the Corinthians received news that Epidamnus was under siege, they began preparing a military expedition and announced a colony to Epidamnus, inviting anyone interested to join on equal terms.

1.27.1
162
εἰ δέ τις τὸ παραυτίκα μὲν μὴ ἐθέλει ξυμπλεῖν, μετέχειν δὲ βούλεται τῆς ἀποικίας, πεντήκοντα δραχμὰς καταθέντα Κορινθίας μένειν .
They also offered an option for those who did not want to join the expedition immediately but still wanted to be part of the colony: they could deposit fifty Corinthian drachmas and remain.

1.27.1
163
ἦσαν δὲ καὶ οἱ πλέοντες πολλοὶ καὶ οἱ τ- ἀργύριον καταβάλλοντες .
There were many who joined the voyage, as well as those who deposited the money.

1.27.2
164
ἐδεήθησαν δὲ καὶ τῶν Μεγαρέων ναυσὶ σφᾶς ξυμπροπέμψαι, εἰ ἄρα κωλύοιντο ὑπὸ Κερκυραίων πλεῖν .
They requested assistance from the Megareans to convoy them with ships, in case the Corcyraeans attempted to block their passage.

1.27.2
165
οἱ δὲ παρεσκευάζοντο αὐτοῖς ὀκτὼ ναυσὶ ξυμπλεῖν, καὶ Παλῆς Κεφαλλήνων τέσσαρσιν .
The Megareans prepared to accompany them with eight ships, and the citizens of Pale in Cephalonia with four.

1.27.2
166
καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίων ἐδεήθησαν, οἳ παρέσχον πέντε, Ἑρμιονῆς δὲ μίαν καὶ Τροιζήνιοι δύο, Λευκάδιοι δὲ δέκα καὶ Ἀμπρακιῶται ὀκτώ .
They also sought help from the Epidaurians, who provided five ships, the Hermionians one, the Traezenians two, the Leucadians ten, and the Ambraciots eight.

1.27.2
167
Θηβαίους δὲ χρήματα ᾔτησαν καὶ Φλειασίους, Ἠλείους δὲ ναῦς τε κενὰς καὶ χρήματα .
They requested money from the Thebans and Phliasians and from the Eleans both empty ships and money.

1.27.2
168
αὐτῶν δὲ Κορινθίων νῆες παρεσκευάζοντο τριάκοντα καὶ τρισχίλιοι ὁπλῖται .
The Corinthians themselves prepared thirty ships and three thousand hoplites.

1.28.1
169
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐπύθοντο οἱ Κερκυραῖοι τὴν παρασκευήν, ἐλθόντες ἐς Κόρινθον μετὰ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Σικυωνίων πρέσβεων, οὓς παρέλαβον, ἐκέλευον Κορινθίους τοὺς ἐν Ἐπιδάμνῳ φρουρούς τε καὶ οἰκήτορας ἀπάγειν, ὡς οὐ μετὸν αὐτοῖς Ἐπιδάμνου .
When the Corcyraeans heard of this preparation, they went to Corinth in company with some Lacedaemonian and Sicyonian ambassadors, whom they took with them, and required the Corinthians to recall the garrison and settlers that were in Epidamnus, as they had nothing to do with the place.

1.28.2
170
εἰ δέ τι ἀντιποιοῦνται, δίκας ἤθελον δοῦναι ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ παρὰ πόλεσιν αἷς ἂν ἀμφότεροι ξυμβῶσιν
But if they laid any claim to it, they were willing to submit to trial in the Peloponnese before such cities as they should both agree on.

1.28.2
171
ὁποτέρων δ’ ἂν δικασθῇ εἶναι τὴν ἀποικίαν, τούτους κρατεῖν
And to which ever of the two parties it should be decided that the colony belonged, they should retain it.

1.28.2
172
ἤθελον δὲ καὶ τῷ ἐν Δελφοῖς μαντείῳ ἐπιτρέψαι
They were willing also to refer their cause to the oracle of Delphi.

1.28.3
173
πόλεμον δὲ οὐκ εἴων ποιεῖν
But they told them not to proceed to war.

1.28.3
174
εἰ δὲ μή, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀναγκασθήσεσθαι ἔφασαν, ἐκείνων βιαζομένων, φίλους ποιεῖσθαι οὓς οὐ βούλονται ἑτέρους τῶν νῦν ὄντων μᾶλλον ὠφελίας ἕνεκα
Else, they said, they themselves would be forced, if forced by the other party, to make different friends from those they currently had, for the sake of gaining assistance.

1.28.4
175
οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι ἀπεκρίναντο αὐτοῖς, ἢν τάς τε ναῦς καὶ τοὺς βαρβάρους ἀπὸ Ἐπιδάμνου ἀπαγάγωσι, βουλεύσεσθαι
The Corinthians answered them that if they would withdraw their fleet and the barbarians from Epidamnus, they would consult on the matter.

1.28.4
176
πρότερον δ’ οὐ καλῶς ἔχειν τοὺς μὲν πολιορκεῖσθαι, αὐτοὺς δὲ δικάζεσθαι
But before that was done, it was not right that the Epidamnians should be besieged while they were appealing to justice.

1.28.5
177
Κερκυραῖοι δὲ ἀντέλεγον, ἢν καὶ ἐκεῖνοι τοὺς ἐν Ἐπιδάμνῳ ἀπαγάγωσι, ποιήσειν ταῦτα
The Corcyraeans replied that if the Corinthians too would withdraw the men they had in Epidamnus, they would do so.

1.28.5
178
ἑτοῖμοι δὲ εἶναι καὶ ὥστε ἀμφοτέρους μένειν κατὰ χώραν, σπονδὰς δὲ ποιήσασθαι ἕως ἂν ἡ δίκη γένηται
They were also ready to let both parties remain where they were and to make a truce until the trial was held.

1.29.1
179
Κορίνθιοι δὲ οὐδὲν τούτων ὑπήκουον, ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ πλήρεις αὐτοῖς ἦσαν αἱ νῆες καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι παρῆσαν, προπέμψαντες κήρυκα πρότερον πόλεμον προεροῦντα Κερκυραίοις, ἄραντες ἑβδομήκοντα ναυσὶ καὶ πέντε δισχιλίοις τε ὁπλίταις ἔπλεον ἐπὶ τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον Κερκυραίοις ἐναντία πολεμήσοντες
The Corinthians did not heed any of these proposals. Once their ships were fully manned and their allies had arrived, they sent a herald to declare war on the Corcyraeans. Then, with seventy ships and two thousand heavy-armed soldiers, they sailed to Epidamnus to wage war against the Corcyraeans.

1.29.2
180
ἐστρατήγει δὲ τῶν μὲν νεῶν Ἀριστεὺς ὁ Πελλίχου καὶ Καλλικράτης ὁ Καλλίου καὶ Τιμάνωρ ὁ Τιμάνθους, τοῦ δὲ πεζοῦ Ἀρχέτιμός τε ὁ Εὐρυτίμου καὶ Ἰσαρχίδας ὁ Ἰσάρχου
Their fleet was commanded by Aristeus the son of Pellichas, Callicrates the son of Callias, and Timanor the son of Timanthes; the land forces by Archetimus the son of Eurytimus, and Isarchidas the son of Isarchus.

1.29.3
181
ἐπειδὴ δ’ ἐγένοντο ἐν Ἀκτίῳ τῆς Ἀνακτορίας γῆς, οὗ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνός ἐστιν, ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ Ἀμπρακικοῦ κόλπου, οἱ Κερκυραῖοι κήρυκά τε προύπεμψαν αὐτοῖς ἐν ἀκατίῳ ἀπεροῦντα μὴ πλεῖν ἐπὶ σφᾶς καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἅμα ἐπλήρουν, ζεύξαντές τε τὰς παλαιὰς ὥστε πλωίμους εἶναι καὶ τὰς ἄλλας ἐπισκευάσαντες
After they were come to Actium in the territory of Anactorium, where is the temple of Apollo, at the mouth of the gulf of Ambracia, the Corcyraeans sent forward a herald to them to forbid their sailing against them; and at the same time were manning their ships, having both undergirded the old ones, so as to make them sea-worthy, and equipped the rest.

1.29.4
182
ὡς δὲ ὁ κῆρύξ τε ἀπήγγειλεν οὐδὲν εἰρηναῖον παρὰ τῶν Κορινθίων καὶ αἱ νῆες αὐτοῖς ἐπεπλήρωντο οὖσαι ὀγδοήκοντα (τεσσαράκοντα γὰρ Ἐπίδαμνον ἐπολιόρκουν), ἀνταναγαγόμενοι καὶ παραταξάμενοι ἐναυμάχησαν
When the herald brought back from the Corinthians no peaceable answer, and their ships were manned, to the number of eighty sail (for forty were besieging Epidamnus), they put out against them, and formed their line, and engaged them.

1.29.5
183
καὶ ἐνίκησαν οἱ Κερκυραῖοι παρὰ πολὺ καὶ ναῦς πέντε καὶ δέκα διέφθειραν τῶν Κορινθίων
And the Corcyraeans won a decided victory, and destroyed fifteen ships of the Corinthians.

1.29.5
184
τῇ δὲ αὐτῇ ἡμέρᾳ αὐτοῖς ξυνέβη καὶ τοὺς τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον πολιορκοῦντας παραστήσασθαι ὁμολογίᾳ ὥστε τοὺς μὲν ἐπήλυδας ἀποδόσθαι, Κορινθίους δὲ δήσαντας ἔχειν ἕως ἂν ἄλλο τι δόξῃ
It happened likewise the same day, that those too who were besieging Epidamnus reduced it to surrender, on condition that they should sell the strangers, and keep the Corinthians in bonds, till something else should be determined.

1.30.1
185
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ναυμαχίαν οἱ Κερκυραῖοι τροπαῖον στήσαντες ἐπὶ τῇ Λευκίμμῃ τῆς Κερκυραίας ἀκρωτηρίῳ τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους οὓς ἔλαβον αἰχμαλώτους ἀπέκτειναν, Κορινθίους δὲ δήσαντες εἶχον
After the battle, the Corcyraeans having set up a trophy on Leucimna, a promontory of Corcyra, slew the other prisoners they had taken, but kept the Corinthians in bonds.

1.30.2
186
ὕστερον δέ, ἐπειδὴ οἱ Κορίνθιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἡσσημένοι ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου, τῆς θαλάσσης ἁπάσης ἐκράτουν τῆς κατ’ ἐκεῖνα τὰ χωρία οἱ Κερκυραῖοι, καὶ πλεύσαντες ἐς Λευκάδα τὴν Κορινθίων ἀποικίαν τῆς γῆς ἔτεμον καὶ Κυλλήνην τὸ Ἠλείων ἐπίνειον ἐνέπρησαν, ὅτι ναῦς καὶ χρήματα παρέσχον Κορινθίοις.
Subsequently, when the Corinthians and their allies, after being vanquished at sea, were gone home, the Corcyraeans were masters of the whole sea in those parts, and sailed to Leucas, a Corinthian colony, and wasted part of the territory; and burnt Cyllene, the arsenal of the Eleans, because they had furnished both money and shipping to the Corinthians.

1.30.3

τοῦ τε χρόνου τὸν πλεῖστον μετὰ τὴν ναυμαχίαν ἐπεκράτουν τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ τοὺς τῶν Κορινθίων ξυμμάχους ἐπιπλέοντες ἔφθειρον, μέχρι οὗ Κορίνθιοι περιιόντι τῷ θέρει πέμψαντες ναῦς καὶ στρατιάν, ἐπεὶ σφῶν οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐπόνουν, ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο ἐπὶ Ἀκτίῳ καὶ περὶ τὸ Χειμέριον τῆς Θεσπρωτίδος φυλακῆς ἕνεκα τῆς τε Λευκάδος καὶ τῶν ἄλλων πόλεων ὅσαι σφίσι φίλιαι ἦσαν.
And most of the time after the battle they were masters of the sea, and continued sailing against and ravaging the allies of the Corinthians; until, on the return of summer, the Corinthians sent ships and an army, in consequence of the distress of their allies, and formed an encampment on Actium, and about Chimerium in Thesprotis, for the protection of Leucas and such other states as were friendly to them.

1.30.4
188
ἀντεστρατοπεδεύοντο δὲ καὶ οἱ Κερκυραῖοι ἐπὶ τῇ Λευκίμμῃ ναυσί τε καὶ πεζῷ.
The Corcyraeans also formed an encampment in opposition to them, on Leucimna, both for their ships and land-forces.

1.30.4
189
ἐπέπλεον δὲ οὐδέτεροι ἀλλήλοις, ἀλλὰ τὸ θέρος τοῦτο ἀντικαθεζόμενοι χειμῶνος ἤδη ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἑκάτεροι.
Neither party sailed against the other; but remaining in opposite stations this summer, at the approach of winter they then each retired homeward.

1.31.1
190
τὸν δ’ ἐνιαυτὸν πάντα τὸν μετὰ τὴν ναυμαχίαν καὶ τὸν ὕστερον οἱ Κορίνθιοι ὀργῇ φέροντες τὸν πρὸς Κερκυραίους πόλεμον ἐναυπηγοῦντο καὶ παρεσκευάζοντο τὰ κράτιστα νεῶν στόλον, ἔκ τε αὐτῆς Πελοποννήσου ἀγείροντες καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος ἐρέτας, μισθῷ πείθοντες.
Now the whole of the year after the sea-fight, and the succeeding one, the Corinthians, being indignant about the war with the Corcyraeans, were building ships, and preparing with all their might a naval armament, drawing together rowers both from the Peloponnese itself and the rest of Greece, by the inducement of the pay they gave.

1.31.2
191
πυνθανόμενοι δὲ οἱ Κερκυραῖοι τὴν παρασκευὴν αὐτῶν ἐφοβοῦντο, καί (ἦσαν γὰρ οὐδενὸς Ἑλλήνων ἔνσπονδοι οὐδὲ ἐσεγράψαντο ἑαυτοὺς οὔτε ἐς τὰς Ἀθηναίων σπονδὰς οὔτε ἐς τὰς Λακεδαιμονίων) ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς ἐλθοῦσιν ὡς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ξυμμάχους γενέσθαι καὶ ὠφελίαν τινὰ πειρᾶσθαι ἀπ’ αὐτῶν εὑρίσκεσθαι.
And the Corcyraeans, on hearing of their preparations, were alarmed; and being in alliance with none of the Greeks, and not having enrolled themselves in the league either of the Athenians or of the Lacedaemonians, they determined to go to the Athenians, and make alliance with them, and endeavour to obtain some assistance from them.

1.31.3
192
οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι πυθόμενοι ταῦτα ἦλθον καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας πρεσβευσόμενοι, ὅπως μὴ σφίσι πρὸς τῷ Κερκυραίων ναυτικῷ καὶ τὸ αὐτῶν προσγενόμενον ἐμπόδιον γένηται θέσθαι τὸν πόλεμον ᾗ βούλονται.
And the Corinthians, on hearing this, went themselves also to Athens on an embassy, to prevent the addition of the Athenian navy to that of the Corcyraeans being an impediment to their concluding the war as they wished.

1.31.4
193
καταστάσης δὲ ἐκκλησίας ἐς ἀντιλογίαν ἦλθον, καὶ οἱ μὲν Κερκυραῖοι ἔλεξαν τοιάδε.
And an assembly having been convened, they came to controversy; and the Corcyraeans spoke as follows:-

1.32.1
194
"Δίκαιον, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, τοὺς μήτε εὐεργεσίας μεγάλης μήτε ξυμμαχίας προυφειλομένης ἥκοντας παρὰ τοὺς πέλας ἐπικουρίας, ὥσπερ καὶ ἡμεῖς νῦν, δεησομένους ἀναδιδάξαι πρῶτον, μάλιστα μὲν ὡς καὶ ξύμφορα δέονται, εἰ δὲ μή, ὅτι γε οὐκ ἐπιζήμια, ἔπειτα δὲ ὡς καὶ τὴν χάριν βέβαιον ἕξουσιν;"
"It is but just, Athenians, that those who without any previous obligation, either of great benefit or alliance, come to their neighbours, as we now do, to beg their assistance, should convince them in the first place, if possible, that they ask what is even expedient but if not that, at any rate what is not injurious; and in the second place, that they will also retain a lasting sense of the favour: and if they establish none of these points clearly, they should not be angry if they do not succeed.

1.32.1
195
εἰ δὲ τούτων μηδὲν σαφὲς καταστήσουσι, μὴ ὀργίζεσθαι ἢν ἀτυχῶσιν.
But the Corcyraeans have sent us with a conviction that, together with their request for alliance, they will show that these points may be relied on by you.

1.32.2
196
Κερκυραῖοι δὲ μετὰ τῆς ξυμμαχίας τῆς αἰτήσεως καὶ ταῦτα πιστεύοντες ἐχυρὰ ὑμῖν παρέξεσθαι ἀπέστειλαν ἡμᾶς.
Now the same policy has happened to prove inconsistent in your eyes, with regard to our request, and inexpedient, with regard to our own interest at the present time.

1.32.3
197
τετύχηκε δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐπιτήδευμα πρός τε ὑμᾶς ἐς τὴν χρείαν ἡμῖν ἄλογον καὶ ἐς τὰ ἡμέτερα αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἀξύμφορον.
This course of action, however, has turned out to be both unreasonable in appealing to you and currently detrimental to our own interests.

1.32.4
198
ξύμμαχοί τε γὰρ οὐδενός πω ἐν τῷ πρὸ τοῦ χρόνῳ ἑκούσιοι γενόμενοι νῦν ἄλλων τοῦτο δεησόμενοι ἥκομεν , καὶ ἅμα ἐς τὸν παρόντα πόλεμον Κορινθίων ἐρῆμοι δι’ αὐτὸ καθέσταμεν .
For having never yet in time past voluntarily become the allies of any party, we are now come to beg this of others; and at the same time we have, owing to it, been left destitute with regard to the present war with the Corinthians.

1.32.4
199
καὶ περιέστηκεν ἡ δοκοῦσα ἡμῶν πρότερον σωφροσύνη , τὸ μὴ ἐν ἀλλοτρίᾳ ξυμμαχίᾳ τῇ τοῦ πέλας γνώμῃ ξυγκινδυνεύειν , νῦν ἀβουλία καὶ ἀσθένεια φαινομένη .
And what before seemed our prudence, viz. not to join in the peril of our neighbour's views by being in alliance with others, has turned out now to be evident folly and weakness.

1.32.5
200
τὴν μὲν οὖν γενομένην ναυμαχίαν αὐτοὶ κατὰ μόνας ἀπεωσάμεθα Κορινθίους ·
In the late sea-fight, indeed, by ourselves and single-handed we repulsed the Corinthians.

1.32.5
201
ἐπειδὴ δὲ μείζονι παρασκευῇ ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς ὥρμηνται καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀδύνατοι ὁρῶμεν ὄντες τῇ οἰκείᾳ μόνον δυνάμει περιγενέσθαι , καὶ ἅμα μέγας ὁ κίνδυνος εἰ ἐσόμεθα ὑπ’ αὐτοῖς , ἀνάγκη καὶ ὑμῶν καὶ ἄλλου παντὸς ἐπικουρίας δεῖσθαι , καὶ ξυγγνώμη εἰ μὴ μετὰ κακίας , δόξης δὲ μᾶλλον ἁμαρτίᾳ τῇ πρότερον ἀπραγμοσύνῃ ἐναντία τολμῶμεν .
But since they have set out against us with a larger force from the Peloponnese and the rest of Greece, and we see ourselves unable to escape by our own power alone; and at the same time our peril is great, if we are subjugated by them; we must beg assistance both from you and every one else: and it is pardonable, if we venture on a course contrary to our former non-interference, [which was practised,] not from any evil intention, but rather from an error of judgment.

1.33.1
202
" γενήσεται δὲ ὑμῖν πειθομένοις καλὴ ἡ ξυντυχία κατὰ πολλὰ τῆς ἡμετέρας χρείας , πρῶτον μὲν ὅτι ἀδικουμένοις καὶ οὐχ ἑτέρους βλάπτουσι τὴν ἐπικουρίαν ποιήσεσθε , ἔπειτα περὶ τῶν μεγίστων κινδυνεύοντας δεξάμενοι ὡς ἂν μάλιστα μετ’ αἰειμνήστου μαρτυρίου τὴν χάριν καταθήσεσθε ·
"Now if you are persuaded by us, the occurrence of our request will be honourable to you in many respects: first, because you will be granting the assistance to men who are injured, and not injuring others: in the next place, by receiving men who have their highest interests at stake, you would bestow the obligation with testimony [to the fact] [*] that would, as far as possible, be always remembered.

1.33.1
203
ναυτικόν τε κεκτήμεθα πλὴν τοῦ παρ’ ὑμῖν πλεῖστον .
and, [lastly,] we are in possession of a navy the largest except yours.

1.33.2
204
καὶ σκέψασθε ·
And consider

1.33.2
205
τίς εὐπραξία σπανιωτέρα ἢ τίς τοῖς πολεμίοις λυπηροτέρα , εἰ ἣν ὑμεῖς ἂν πρὸ πολλῶν χρημάτων καὶ χάριτος ἐτιμήσασθε δύναμιν ὑμῖν προσγενέσθαι , αὕτη πάρεστιν αὐτεπάγγελτος ἄνευ κινδύνων καὶ δαπάνης διδοῦσα ἑαυτήν , καὶ προσέτι φέρουσα ἐς μὲν τοὺς πολλοὺς ἀρετήν , οἷς δὲ ἐπαμυνεῖτε χάριν , ὑμῖν δ’ αὐτοῖς ἰσχύν ·
what good fortune is more rare, or what more annoying to the enemy, than if that power, the addition of which to yours you would have valued above much money and favour, come of its own accord, offering itself without dangers and expense; and moreover affording, in the eyes of the world at large, a character for goodness, and to those whom you will assist, obligation; and to yourselves, strength;

1.33.2
206
ἃ ἐν τῷ παντὶ χρόνῳ ὀλίγοις δὴ ἅμα πάντα ξυνέβη , καὶ ὀλίγοι ξυμμαχίας δεόμενοι οἷς ἐπικαλοῦνται ἀσφάλειαν καὶ κόσμον οὐχ ἧσσον διδόντες ἢ ληψόμενοι παραγίγνονται .
all of which advantages together have fallen to the lot of few indeed in the whole course of time: and few are there who, when begging alliance, go conferring safety and honour on the men whose aid they invoke, no less than to receive them.

1.33.3
207
τὸν δὲ πόλεμον, δι’ ὅνπερ χρήσιμοι ἂν εἶμεν, εἴ τις ὑμῶν μὴ οἴεται ἔσεσθαι, γνώμης ἁμαρτάνει καὶ οὐκ αἰσθάνεται τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους φόβῳ τῷ ὑμετέρῳ πολεμησείοντας καὶ τοὺς Κορινθίους δυναμένους παρ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ ὑμῖν ἐχθροὺς ὄντας καὶ προκαταλαμβάνοντας ἡμᾶς νῦν ἐς τὴν ὑμετέραν ἐπιχείρησιν, ἵνα μὴ τῷ κοινῷ ἔχθει κατ’ αὐτοὺς μετ’ ἀλλήλων στῶμεν μηδὲ δυοῖν φθάσαι ἁμάρτωσιν, ἢ κακῶσαι ἡμᾶς ἢ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς βεβαιώσασθαι. And as for the war in which we should be useful, if any of you do not think that it will arise, he is deceived in his opinion; and does not observe that the Lacedaemonians, through their fear of you, are longing for war and that the Corinthians have power with them, and are hostile to you, and are now first subduing us with a view to attacking you, that we may not stand with each other in common hostility to them; and that they may not fail to gain one of two advantages, either to injure us, or to strengthen themselves.

1.33.4
208
ἡμέτερον δέ γ’ αὖ ἔργον προτερῆσαι , τῶν μὲν διδόντων , ὑμῶν δὲ δεξαμένων τὴν ξυμμαχίαν , καὶ προεπιβουλεύειν αὐτοῖς μᾶλλον ἢ ἀντεπιβουλεύειν .
But it is our business, on the contrary, to be beforehand with them, by our offering and your accepting the alliance; and to plot against them first, rather than to meet their plots against us.

1.34.1
209
ἢν δὲ λέγωσιν ὡς οὐ δίκαιον τοὺς σφετέρους ἀποίκους ὑμᾶς δέχεσθαι , μαθόντων ὡς πᾶσα ἀποικία εὖ μὲν πάσχουσα τιμᾷ τὴν μητρόπολιν , ἀδικουμένη δὲ ἀλλοτριοῦται ·
"But should they say that it is not just for you to receive their colonists, let them learn that every colony, if well treated, honours its mother-country; but if wronged, is estranged from it; for they are not sent out to be slaves, but to be on the same footing with those who are left at home.

1.34.1
210
οὐ γὰρ ἐπὶ τῷ δοῦλοι , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τῷ ὁμοῖοι τοῖς λειπομένοις εἶναι ἐκπέμπονται .
For they are not sent out to be slaves, but to be on the same footing with those who are left at home.

1.34.2
211
ὡς δὲ ἠδίκουν σαφές ἐστιν ·
And that they wronged us, is evident;

1.34.2
212
προκληθέντες γὰρ περὶ Ἐπιδάμνου ἐς κρίσιν πολέμῳ μᾶλλον ἢ τῷ ἴσῳ ἐβουλήθησαν τὰ ἐγκλήματα μετελθεῖν .
for when challenged [*] to a judicial decision respecting Epidamnus, they chose to prosecute the charges by war rather than by equity.

1.34.3
213
καὶ ὑμῖν ἔστω τι τεκμήριον ἃ πρὸς ἡμᾶς τοὺς ξυγγενεῖς δρῶσιν , ὥστε ἀπάτῃ τε μὴ παράγεσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτῶν δεομένοις τε ἐκ τοῦ εὐθέος μὴ ὑπουργεῖν ·
And let what they are doing to us, their kinsmen, be a warning to you, that you may both avoid being seduced by them, through any false pretence; and may refuse to assist them, if they ask you in a straightforward manner:

1.34.3
214
ὁ γὰρ ἐλαχίστας τὰς μεταμελείας ἐκ τοῦ χαρίζεσθαι τοῖς ἐναντίοις λαμβάνων ἀσφαλέστατος ἂν διατελοίη .
for he who incurs the fewest regrets from gratifying his enemies would continue in the greatest safety.

1.35.1
215
λύσετε δὲ οὐδὲ τὰς Λακεδαιμονίων σπονδὰς δεχόμενοι ἡμᾶς μηδετέρων ὄντας ξυμμάχους ·
"But neither will you break the treaty with the Lacedaemonians by receiving us, who are allies of neither party.

1.35.2
216
εἴρηται γὰρ ἐν αὐταῖς , τῶν Ἑλληνίδων πόλεων ἥτις μηδαμοῦ ξυμμαχεῖ ,ἐξεῖναι παρ’ ὁποτέρους ἂν ἀρέσκηται ἐλθεῖν .
For it is mentioned in it, that whichever of the Grecian states is in alliance with no other, it has permission to go to whichever side it may please.

1.35.3
217
καὶ δεινὸν εἰ τοῖσδε μὲν ἀπό τε τῶν ἐνσπόνδων ἔσται πληροῦν τὰς ναῦς καὶ προσέτι καὶ ἐκ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα ἀπὸ τῶν ὑμετέρων ὑπηκόων , ἡμᾶς δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς προκειμένης τε ξυμμαχίας εἴρξουσι καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἄλλοθέν ποθεν ὠφελίας , εἶτα ἐν ἀδικήματι θήσονται πεισθέντων ὑμῶν ἃ δεόμεθα .
And it is hard if these shall be allowed to man their ships both from the confederates, and moreover from the rest of Greece also, and especially from your subjects, while they will exclude us both from our proposed alliance, and from assistance from any other quarter; and then consider it an injustice if you are persuaded to what we request.

1.35.4
218
πολὺ δὲ ἐν πλέονι αἰτίᾳ ἡμεῖς μὴ πείσαντες ὑμᾶς ἕξομεν ·
But much greater fault shall we find with you, if we do not persuade you.

1.35.4
219
ἡμᾶς μὲν γὰρ κινδυνεύοντας καὶ οὐκ ἐχθροὺς ὄντας ἀπώσεσθε , τῶνδε δὲ οὐχ ὅπως κωλυταὶ ἐχθρῶν ὄντων καὶ ἐπιόντων γενήσεσθε , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ὑμετέρας ἀρχῆς δύναμιν προσλαβεῖν περιόψεσθε ·
For us who are in peril, and not actuated by any hostile feeling, you will reject; while these men who are thus actuated, and have made the attack, you will be so far from restraining, that you will even overlook their gaining additional power from your dominions; which you should not do; but should either stop their mercenaries drawn from your country, or send succour to us also, in what ever way you may be persuaded; but it were best of all to receive us openly, and assist us.

1.35.4
220
ἣν οὐ δίκαιον , ἀλλ’ ἢ κ- ἐκείνων κωλύειν τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ὑμετέρας μισθοφόρους ἢ καὶ ἡμῖν πέμπειν καθ’ ὅτι ἂν πεισθῆτε ὠφελίαν , μάλιστα δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ προφανοῦς δεξαμένους βοηθεῖν .
which you should not do; but should either stop their mercenaries drawn from your country, or send succour to us also, in what ever way you may be persuaded; but it were best of all to receive us openly, and assist us.

1.35.5
221
πολλὰ δέ , ὥσπερ ἐν ἀρχῇ ὑπείπομεν , τὰ ξυμφέροντα ἀποδείκνυμεν , καὶ μέγιστον ὅτι οἵ τε αὐτοὶ πολέμιοι ἡμῖν ἦσαν , ὅπερ σαφεστάτη πίστις , καὶ οὗτοι οὐκ ἀσθενεῖς , ἀλλ’ ἱκανοὶ τοὺς μεταστάντας βλάψαι ·
And many, as we hinted at the beginning, are the advantages we hold forth to you; but the greatest of them is, that we both have the same enemies, (which is the surest bond,) and those not weak, but able to harm such as have stood aloof from them.

1.35.5
222
καὶ ναυτικῆς καὶ οὐκ ἠπειρώτιδος τῆς ξυμμαχίας διδομένης οὐχ ὁμοία ἡ ἀλλοτρίωσις , ἀλλὰ μάλιστα μέν , εἰ δύνασθε , μηδένα ἄλλον ἐᾶν κεκτῆσθαι ναῦς , εἰ δὲ μή , ὅστις ἐχυρώτατος , τοῦτον φίλον ἔχειν .
And as it is a naval, and not a land alliance that is offered you, the loss of it is not the same; but it were best, if possible, to allow no one else to possess ships; but if not, whoever is strongest in them, to have him for your friend.

1.36.1
223
" καὶ ὅτῳ τάδε ξυμφέροντα μὲν δοκεῖ λέγεσθαι , φοβεῖται δὲ μὴ δι’ αὐτὰ πειθόμενος τὰς σπονδὰς λύσῃ , γνώτω τὸ μὲν δεδιὸς αὐτοῦ ἰσχὺν ἔχον τοὺς ἐναντίους μᾶλλον φοβῆσον , τὸ δὲ θαρσοῦν μὴ δεξαμένου ἀσθενὲς ὂν πρὸς ἰσχύοντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἀδεέστερον ἐσόμενον , καὶ ἅμα οὐ περὶ τῆς Κερκύρας νῦν τὸ πλέον ἢ καὶ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν βουλευόμενος , καὶ οὐ τὰ κράτιστα αὐταῖς προνοῶν , ὅταν ἐς τὸν μέλλοντα καὶ ὅσον οὐ παρόντα πόλεμον τὸ αὐτίκα περισκοπῶν ἐνδοιάζῃ χωρίον προσλαβεῖν ὃ μετὰ μεγίστων καιρῶν οἰκειοῦταί τε καὶ πολεμοῦται .
And whoever thinks that these things which we have urged are indeed expedient, but is afraid that through being persuaded by them he would break the treaty; let him know that his fear, being attended by strength, will cause greater alarm to his enemies; but that his confidence in not having received us, being powerless will be less formidable to his foes who are strong; and also, that it is not about Corcyra more than about Athens too that he is deliberating; and that he is not providing the best for her, when for the war that is coming, and all but here, he hesitates, from present considerations, to receive a country which is made either a friend or a foe, with the greatest opportunities [for good or evil].

1.36.2
224
τῆς τε γὰρ Ἰταλίας καὶ Σικελίας καλῶς παράπλου κεῖται , ὥστε μήτε ἐκεῖθεν ναυτικὸν ἐᾶσαι Πελοποννησίοις ἐπελθεῖν τό τε ἐνθένδε πρὸς τ- ἐκεῖ παραπέμψαι , καὶ ἐς τ- ἄλλα ξυμφορώτατόν ἐστιν .
For it lies well for the voyage along shore to Italy and Sicily, so as both to prevent a navy from coming thence to the Peloponnesians, and to help on its way a fleet from these parts to those; and in other respects it is most advantageous.

1.36.3
225
βραχυτάτῳ δ’ ἂν κεφαλαίῳ , τοῖς τε ξύμπασι καὶ καθ’ ἕκαστον , τῷδ’ ἂν μὴ προέσθαι ἡμᾶς μάθοιτε ·
But the shortest summary, [*] both for general and particular statements, from which you may learn not to give us up, is the following.

1.36.3
226
τρία μὲν ὄντα λόγου ἄξια τοῖς Ἕλλησι ναυτικά , τὸ παρ’ ὑμῖν καὶ τὸ ἡμέτερον καὶ τὸ Κορινθίων ·
There being [*] but three navies worth mentioning amongst the Greeks, yours, ours, and that of the Corinthians.

1.36.3
227
τούτων δὲ εἰ περιόψεσθε τὰ δύο ἐς τ- αὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν καὶ Κορίνθιοι ἡμᾶς προκαταλήψονται , Κερκυραίοις τε καὶ Πελοποννησίοις ἅμα ναυμαχήσετε , δεξάμενοι δὲ ἡμᾶς ἕξετε πρὸς αὐτοὺς πλείοσι ναυσὶ ταῖς ἡμετέραις ἀγωνίζεσθαι " .
if you allow two of these to come together, and the Corinthians bring us under their power first, you will have to fight at sea with both Corcyraeans and Peloponnesians; but if you receive us you will be able to contend against them with the greater number of ships on your side.

1.36.4
228
τοιαῦτα μὲν οἱ Κερκυραῖοι εἶπον ·
Thus spoke the Corcyraeans;

1.36.4
229
οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι μετ’ αὐτοὺς τοιάδε .
and the Corinthians after them as follows.

1.37.1
230
" ἀναγκαῖον Κερκυραίων τῶνδε οὐ μόνον περὶ τοῦ δέξασθαι σφᾶς τὸν λόγον ποιησαμ

1.37.2
231
" φασὶ δὲ ξυμμαχίαν διὰ τὸ σῶφρον οὐδενός πω δέξασθαι ·
Now they say that it was from regard to prudence that hitherto they accepted the alliance of no party:

1.37.2
232
τὸ δ’ ἐπὶ κακουργίᾳ καὶ οὐκ ἀρετῇ ἐπετήδευσαν , ξύμμαχόν τε οὐδένα βουλόμενοι πρὸς τ- ἀδικήματα οὐδὲ μάρτυρα ἔχειν οὔτε παρακαλοῦντες αἰσχύνεσθαι .
whereas they adopted this practice for villany, and not for virtue; but from wishing to have no ally or witness in their unjust deeds, nor to be put to the blush by calling him to their aid.

1.37.3
233
καὶ ἡ πόλις αὐτῶν ἅμα αὐτάρκη θέσιν κειμένη παρέχει αὐτοὺς δικαστὰς ὧν βλάπτουσί τινα μᾶλλον ἢ κατὰ ξυνθήκας γίγνεσθαι , διὰ τὸ ἥκιστα ἐπὶ τοὺς πέλας ἐκπλέοντας μάλιστα τοὺς ἄλλους ἀνάγκῃ καταίροντας δέχεσθαι .
And their city also, lying in a self-sufficient position, makes them judges of the injuries they inflict on any one, rather than that there should be judges appointed by agreement; because, while they very seldom sail from home to their neighbours, they very frequently receive others, who of necessity touch there.

1.37.4
234
καὶ τοῦτο τὸ εὐπρεπὲς ἄσπονδον οὐχ ἵνα μὴ ξυναδικῶσιν ἑτέροις προβέβληνται , ἀλλ’ ὅπως κατὰ μόνας ἀδικῶσι καὶ ὅπως ἐν ᾧ μὲν ἂν κρατῶσι βιάζωνται , οὗ δ’ ἂν λάθωσι πλέον ἔχωσιν , ἢν δέ πού τι προσλάβωσιν ἀναισχυντῶσιν ·
And herein consists the specious shunning of confederacies, which they have put forward; not that they may avoid committing injustice with other, but that they may commit them by themselves; and that wherever they have the power, they may act with violence; and where they escape observation, they may take unfair advantage; and if in any case they have seized on something, they may not be put to the blush.

1.37.5
235
καίτοι εἰ ἦσαν ἄνδρες ,ὥσπερ φασίν , ἀγαθοί , ὅσῳ ἀληπτότεροι ἦσαν τοῖς πέλας , τόσῳ δὲ φανερωτέραν ἐξῆν αὐτοῖς τὴν ἀρετὴν διδοῦσι καὶ δεχομένοις τὰ δίκαια δεικνύναι .
And yet, if they were, as they say, honest men, the more impregnable they were to their neighbours, the more manifestly might they have shown their virtue, by giving and taking what was just.

1.38.1
236
ἀλλ’ οὔτε πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους οὔτε ἐς ἡμᾶς τοιοίδε εἰσίν , ἄποικοι δ’ ὄντες ἀφεστᾶσί τε διὰ παντὸς καὶ νῦν πολεμοῦσι , λέγοντες ὡς οὐκ ἐπὶ τῷ κακῶς πάσχειν ἐκπεμφθεῖεν .
"But neither to others nor to us are they of such a character; but although our colonists, they have all along revolted from us, and are now making war upon us; saying that they were not sent out to be ill-treated.

1.38.2
237
ἡμεῖς δὲ οὐδ’ αὐτοί φαμεν ἐπὶ τῷ ὑπὸ τούτων ὑβρίζεσθαι κατοικίσαι , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τῷ ἡγεμόνες τε εἶναι καὶ τὰ εἰκότα θαυμάζεσθαι .
But we say that neither did we settle them there to be insulted by them, but to be their leaders, and to be properly respected by them.

1.38.3
238
αἱ γοῦν ἄλλαι ἀποικίαι τιμῶσιν ἡμᾶς , καὶ μάλιστα ὑπὸ ἀποίκων στεργόμεθα ·
Our other colonies, at least, honour us, and we are very much beloved by our colonists;

1.38.4
239
καὶ δῆλον ὅτι , εἰ τοῖς πλέοσιν ἀρέσκοντές ἐσμεν , τοῖσδ’ ἂν μόνοις οὐκ ὀρθῶς ἀπαρέσκοιμεν , οὐδ’ ἐπιστρατεύομεν ἐκπρεπῶς μὴ καὶ διαφερόντως τι ἀδικούμενοι .
and it is evident, that if we are pleasing to the greater part, we should not, on a right view of the case, be displeasing to these alone; nor do we attack them unbecomingly, without being also signally injured by them.

1.38.5
240
καλὸν δ’ ἦν , εἰ καὶ ἡμαρτάνομεν , τοῖσδε μὲν εἶξαι τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ὀργῇ , ἡμῖν δὲ αἰσχρὸν βιάσασθαι τὴν τούτων μετριότητα ·
Even if we were in the wrong, it had been honourable for them to have yielded to our humour; but disgraceful for us to have done violence to their moderation:

1.38.5
241
ὕβρει δὲ καὶ ἐξουσίᾳ πλούτου πολλὰ ἐς ἡμᾶς ἄλλα τε ἡμαρτήκασι καὶ Ἐπίδαμνον ἡμετέραν οὖσαν κακουμένην μὲν οὐ προσεποιοῦντο , ἐλθόντων δὲ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ τιμωρίᾳ ἑλόντες βίᾳ ἔχουσιν .
but through pride, and power of wealth, they have both acted wrongly towards us in many other things, and with regard to Epidamnus, which belonged to us, when it was ill-treated they did not claim it; but when we went to its assistance, they took it by force, and keep it.

1.39.1
242
καὶ φασὶ δὴ δίκῃ πρότερον ἐθελῆσαι κρίνεσθαι , ἥν γε οὐ τὸν προύχοντα καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἀσφαλοῦς προκαλούμενον λέγειν τι δοκεῖν δεῖ , ἀλλὰ τὸν ἐς ἴσον τά τε ἔργα ὁμοίως καὶ τοὺς λόγους πρὶν διαγωνίζεσθαι καθιστάντα .

"And they say, forsooth, that they were before willing to have it judicially decided : but with regard to this, it is not the man who proposes it with superiority, and in safety, that should be considered to say any thing; but that man, who puts alike his actions and words on the same footing, before he enters on the struggle.

1.39.2
243
οὗτοι δὲ οὐ πρὶν πολιορκεῖν τὸ χωρίον , ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ ἡγήσαντο ἡμᾶς οὐ περιόψεσθαι , τότε καὶ τὸ εὐπρεπὲς τῆς δίκης παρέσχοντο .
But as for these men, it was not before they besieged the place, but when they thought that we should not put up with it, that they also advanced the specious plea of a judicial decision.

1.39.2
244
καὶ δεῦρο ἥκουσιν οὐ τ- ἐκεῖ μόνον αὐτοὶ ἁμαρτόντες , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑμᾶς νῦν ἀξιοῦντες οὐ ξυμμαχεῖν , ἀλλὰ ξυναδικεῖν καὶ διαφόρους ὄντας ἡμῖν δέχεσθαι σφᾶς ·
And they are come hither, not only having themselves done wrong there, but now requesting you also to join them, not in alliance, but in injury; and to receive them, when they are at variance with us. 

1.39.3
245
οὓς χρῆν , ὅτε ἀσφαλέστατοι ἦσαν , τότε προσιέναι , καὶ μὴ ἐν ᾧ ἡμεῖς μὲν ἠδικήμεθα , οὗτοι δὲ κινδυνεύουσι , μηδ’ ἐν ᾧ ὑμεῖς τῆς τε δυνάμεως αὐτῶν τότε οὐ μεταλαβόντες τῆς ὠφελίας νῦν μεταδώσετε καὶ τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων ἀπογενόμενοι τῆς ἀφ’ ἡμῶν αἰτίας τὸ ἴσον ἕξετε , πάλαι δὲ κοινώσαντας τὴν δύναμιν κοινὰ καὶ τὰ ἀποβαίνοντα ἔχειν .
But then ought they to have applied to you, when they were most secure; and not at a time when we have been injured, and they are in peril; nor at a time when you, though you did not share their power then, will now give them a share of your aid; and though you stood aloof from their misdeeds, will incur equal blame from us; but they ought long ago to have communicated their power to you, and so to have the results also in common.

1.40.1
246
ὡς μὲν οὖν αὐτοί τε μετὰ προσηκόντων ἐγκλημάτων ἐρχόμεθα καὶ οἵδε βίαιοι καὶ πλεονέκται εἰσὶ δεδήλωται ·
That we ourselves, then, come with accusations on proper grounds, and that these are violent and rapacious, has been proved;

1.40.1
247
ὡς δὲ οὐκ ἂν δικαίως αὐτοὺς δέχοισθε μαθεῖν χρή .
and that you could not with justice receive them, you must now learn.

1.40.2
248
εἰ γὰρ εἴρηται ἐν ταῖς σπονδαῖς ἐξεῖναι παρ’ ὁποτέρους τις βούλεται τῶν ἀγράφων πόλεων ἐλθεῖν , οὐ τοῖς ἐπὶ βλάβῃ ἑτέρων ἰοῦσιν ἡ ξυνθήκη ἐστίν , ἀλλ’ ὅστις μὴ ἄλλου ἑαυτὸν ἀποστερῶν ἀσφαλείας δεῖται καὶ ὅστις μὴ τοῖς δεξαμένοις , εἰ σωφρονοῦσι , πόλεμον ἀντ’ εἰρήνης ποιήσει ·
For if it is said in the treaty, that any of the states not registered in it may go to whichever side it please
, the agreement was not meant for those who go to the detriment of others; but to any one who, without withdrawing himself from another, is in need of protection; and who will not cause war instead of peace to those who receive him, (as they will not do if they are wise;) 

1.40.2
249
ὃ νῦν ὑμεῖς μὴ πειθόμενοι ἡμῖν πάθοιτε ἄν .
which would now be your case, if not persuaded by us.

1.40.3
250
οὐ γὰρ τοῖσδε μόνον ἐπίκουροι ἂν γένοισθε , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡμῖν ἀντὶ ἐνσπόνδων πολέμιοι ·
For you would not only become auxiliaries to these, but also enemies to us, instead of being connected by treaty;

1.40.3
251
ἀνάγκη γάρ , εἰ ἴτε μετ’ αὐτῶν , καὶ ἀμύνεσθαι μὴ ἄνευ ὑμῶν τούτους .
for if you come with them, we must defend ourselves against them without excepting you. 

1.40.4
252
καίτοι δίκαιοί γ’ ἐστὲ μάλιστα μὲν ἐκποδὼν στῆναι ἀμφοτέροις , εἰ δὲ μή , τ- ἐναντίον ἐπὶ τούτους μεθ’ ἡμῶν ἰέναι ( Κορινθίοις μέν γε ἔνσπονδοί ἐστε , Κερκυραίοις δὲ οὐδὲ δι’ ἀνοκωχῆς πώποτ’ ἐγένεσθε ) , καὶ τὸν νόμον μὴ καθιστάναι ὥστε τοὺς ἑτέρων ἀφισταμένους δέχεσθαι .
And yet you ought, if possible, to stand aloof from both parties; or if not that, on the contrary, to go with us against them; (with the Corinthians, at any rate, you are connected by treaty; while with the Corcyraeans you were never yet so much as in truce;) and not to establish the law, that we should receive those who are revolting from others.

1.40.5
253
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἡμεῖς Σαμίων ἀποστάντων ψῆφον προσεθέμεθα ἐναντίαν ὑμῖν , τῶν ἄλλων Πελοποννησίων δίχα ἐψηφισμένων εἰ χρὴ αὐτοῖς ἀμύνειν , φανερῶς δὲ ἀντείπομεν τοὺς προσήκοντας ξυμμάχους αὐτόν τινα κολάζειν .
For neither did we, when the Samians had revolted, give our vote against you, when the rest of the Peloponnesians were divided in their votes, as to whether they should assist them; but we openly maintained the contrary, that each one should punish his own allies.

1.40.6
254
εἰ γὰρ τοὺς κακόν τι δρῶντας δεχόμενοι τιμωρήσετε , φανεῖται καὶ ἃ τῶν ὑμετέρων οὐκ ἐλάσσω ἡμῖν πρόσεισι , καὶ τὸν νόμον ἐφ’ ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς μᾶλλον ἢ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν θήσετε .
For if you receive and assist those who are doing wrong, there will be found no fewer of your allies also who will come over to us; and you will make the law against yourselves, rather than against us.

1.41.1
255
δικαιώματα μὲν οὖν τάδε πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἔχομεν ἱκανὰ κατὰ τοὺς Ἑλλήνων νόμους , παραίνεσιν δὲ καὶ ἀξίωσιν χάριτος τοιάνδε , ἣν οὐκ ἐχθροὶ ὄντες ὥστε βλάπτειν οὐδ’ αὖ φίλοι ὥστ’ ἐπιχρῆσθαι , ἀντιδοθῆναι ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ παρόντι φαμὲν χρῆναι .
"These, then, are the pleas of right which we have to urge to you, sufficiently strong according to the laws of the Greeks; and we have the following advice, and claim on you for favour, which, being not enemies so as to hurt you, nor, on the other hand, such friends as to be very intimate with you, we say ought to be repaid to us at the present time.

1.41.2
256
νεῶν γὰρ μακρῶν σπανίσαντές ποτε πρὸς τὸν Αἰγινητῶν ὑπὲρ τὰ Μηδικὰ πόλεμον παρὰ Κορινθίων εἴκοσι ναῦς ἐλάβετε ·
For once, when you were in want of long ships for the war with the Aeginetans, before that with the Medes, you received from the Corinthians twenty ships.

1.41.2
257
καὶ ἡ εὐεργεσία αὕτη τε καὶ ἡ ἐς Σαμίους , τὸ δι’ ἡμᾶς Πελοποννησίους αὐτοῖς μὴ βοηθῆσαι , παρέσχεν ὑμῖν Αἰγινητῶν μὲν ἐπικράτησιν , Σαμίων δὲ κόλασιν , καὶ ἐν καιροῖς τοιούτοις ἐγένετο οἷς μάλιστα ἄνθρωποι ἐπ’ ἐχθροὺς τοὺς σφετέρους ἰόντες τῶν ἁπάντων ἀπερίοπτοί εἰσι παρὰ τὸ νικᾶν ·
And this service, and that with regard to the Samians, namely, that it was through us that the Peloponnesians did not assist them, gave you the mastery of the Aeginetans, and the chastisement of the Samians: and it took place in those critical times in which men, when proceeding against their enemies, are most regardless of everything besides victory.

1.41.3
258
φίλον τε γὰρ ἡγοῦνται τὸν ὑπουργοῦντα , ἢν καὶ πρότερον ἐχθρὸς ᾖ , πολέμιόν τε τὸν ἀντιστάντα , ἢν καὶ τύχῃ φίλος ὤν , ἐπεὶ καὶ τὰ οἰκεῖα χεῖρον τίθενται φιλονικίας ἕνεκα τῆς αὐτίκα .
For they esteem him a friend who assists them, even though he may before have been an enemy; and him a foe who opposes them, though he may have happened to be a friend; nay they even mismanage their own affairs for the sake of their animosity at the moment.

1.42.1
259
ὧν ἐνθυμηθέντες καὶ νεώτερός τις παρὰ πρεσβυτέρου αὐτὰ μαθὼν ἀξιούτω τοῖς ὁμοίοις ἡμᾶς ἀμύνεσθαι , καὶ μὴ νομίσῃ δίκαια μὲν τάδε λέγεσθαι , ξύμφορα δέ , εἰ πολεμήσει , ἄλλα εἶναι .
"Thinking then of these things, and each younger man having learned them from some one older, let him resolve to requite us with the like, and not deem that these things are justly urged, but that others are expedient in case of his going to war.

1.42.2
260
τό τε γὰρ ξυμφέρον ἐν ᾧ ἄν τις ἐλάχιστα ἁμαρτάνῃ μάλιστα ἕπεται , καὶ τὸ μέλλον τοῦ πολέμου ᾧ φοβοῦντες ὑμᾶς Κερκυραῖοι κελεύουσιν ἀδικεῖν ἐν ἀφανεῖ ἔτι κεῖται , καὶ οὐκ ἄξιον ἐπαρθέντας αὐτῷ φανερὰν ἔχθραν ἤδη καὶ οὐ μέλλουσαν πρὸς Κορινθίους κτήσασθαι , τῆς δὲ ὑπαρχούσης πρότερον διὰ Μεγαρέας ὑποψίας σῶφρον ὑφελεῖν μᾶλλον ( ἡ γὰρ τελευταία χάρις καιρὸν ἔχουσα , κἂν ἐλάσσων ᾖ , δύναται μεῖζον ἔγκλημα λῦσαι ) , μηδ’ ὅτι ναυτικοῦ ξυμμαχίαν μεγάλην διδόασι , τούτῳ ἐφέλκεσθαι ·
For expediency most attends that line of conduct in which one does least wrong. And as for the coming of the war, frightening you with which the Corcyrraeans bid you commit injustice, it lies as yet in uncertainty; and it is not worth while, through being excited by it, to incur a certain enmity with the Corinthians, immediate, and not coming; but rather it were prudent to remove somewhat of our before existing suspicion on account of the Megareans.

1.42.4
261
τὸ γὰρ μὴ ἀδικεῖν τοὺς ὁμοίους ἐχυρωτέρα δύναμις ἢ τῷ αὐτίκα φανερῷ ἐπαρθέντας διὰ κινδύνων τὸ πλέον ἔχειν .
For not to injure your equals is a power more to be relied on, than, through being buoyed up by momentary appearances, to gain an unfair advantage by a perilous course.

1.43.1
262
ἡμεῖς δὲ περιπεπτωκότες οἷς ἐν τῇ Λακεδαίμονι αὐτοὶ προείπομεν , τοὺς σφετέρους ξυμμάχους αὐτόν τινα κολάζειν , νῦν παρ’ ὑμῶν τὸ αὐτὸ ἀξιοῦμεν κομίζεσθαι , καὶ μὴ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ψήφῳ ὠφεληθέντας τῇ ὑμετέρᾳ ἡμᾶς βλάψαι .
We then, having fallen under the rule which we propounded ourselves at Lacedaemon, that every one should punish his own allies, now claim to receive the same from you; and not that you, after being benefited by our vote, should harm us by yours. Make us then a fair return;

1.43.2
263
τὸ δὲ ἴσον ἀνταπόδοτε , γνόντες τοῦτον ἐκεῖνον εἶναι τὸν καιρὸν ἐν ᾧ ὅ τε ὑπουργῶν φίλος μάλιστα καὶ ὁ ἀντιστὰς ἐχθρός .
Make us then a fair return, knowing that this is that very crisis, in which he that helps is most a friend, and he that opposes, a foe.

1.43.3
264
καὶ Κερκυραίους τούσδε μήτε ξυμμάχους δέχεσθε βίᾳ ἡμῶν μήτε ἀμύνετε αὐτοῖς ἀδικοῦσιν .
And for these Corcyraeans, neither receive them as allies in spite of us, nor help them in doing wrong.

1.43.4
265
καὶ τάδε ποιοῦντες τὰ προσήκοντά τε δράσετε καὶ τὰ ἄριστα βουλεύσεσθε ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς " .
By thus acting, you will both do what becomes you, and advise the best for yourselves.

1.44.1
266
τοιαῦτα δὲ καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι εἶπον .
To this effect then did the Corinthians also speak.

1.44.1
267
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ἀκούσαντες ἀμφοτέρων , γενομένης καὶ δὶς ἐκκλησίας , τῇ μὲν προτέρᾳ οὐχ ἧσσον τῶν Κορινθίων ἀπεδέξαντο τοὺς λόγους , ἐν δὲ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ μετέγνωσαν Κερκυραίοις ξυμμαχίαν μὲν μὴ ποιήσασθαι ὥστε τοὺς αὐτοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ φίλους νομίζειν ( εἰ γὰρ ἐπὶ Κόρινθον ἐκέλευον σφίσιν οἱ Κερκυραῖοι ξυμπλεῖν , ἐλύοντ’ ἂν αὐτοῖς αἱ πρὸς Πελοποννησίους σπονδαί ) , ἐπιμαχίαν δ’ ἐποιήσαντο τῇ ἀλλήλων βοηθεῖν , ἐάν τις ἐπὶ Κέρκυραν ἴῃ ἢ Ἀθήνας ἢ τοὺς τούτων ξυμμάχους .
Now the Athenians, after hearing both sides, when an assembly had been held twice, in the former rather admitted the arguments of the Corinthians; but in the one held the next day they changed their minds, and determined, not indeed to make an alliance with the Corcyraeans, so as to have the same enemies and friends, but they made a defensive alliance, to succour each other's country, should any one go against Corcyra, or Athens, or their allies.

1.44.2
268
ἐδόκει γὰρ ὁ πρὸς Πελοποννησίους πόλεμος καὶ ὣς ἔσεσθαι αὐτοῖς , καὶ τὴν Κέρκυραν ἐβούλοντο μὴ προέσθαι τοῖς Κορινθίοις ναυτικὸν ἔχουσαν τοσοῦτον , ξυγκρούειν δὲ ὅτι μάλιστα αὐτοὺς ἀλλήλοις , ἵνα ἀσθενεστέροις οὖσιν , ἤν τι δέῃ , Κορινθίοις τε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ναυτικὸν ἔχουσιν ἐς πόλεμον καθιστῶνται .
For they thought that, even as it was, they should have the war with the Peloponnesians; and they wished not to give up Corcyra to the Corinthians, with so large a navy as it had, but to wear them out as much as possible against each other, that both the Corinthians and the rest who had navies might be in a weaker condition when they went to war with them, if it should be necessary to do so.

1.44.3
269
ἅμα δὲ τῆς τε Ἰταλίας καὶ Σικελίας καλῶς ἐφαίνετο αὐτοῖς ἡ νῆσος ἐν παράπλῳ κεῖσθαι .
And at the same time the island appeared to them to lie well in the line of voyage along shore to Italy and Sicily.

1.45.1
270
τοιαύτῃ μὲν γνώμῃ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς Κερκυραίους προσεδέξαντο , καὶ τῶν Κορινθίων ἀπελθόντων οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον δέκα ναῦς αὐτοῖς ἀπέστειλαν βοηθούς ·
With such a view of the case the Athenians admitted the Corcyraeans into alliance; and when the Corinthians had departed, they sent ten ships to assist them.

1.45.2
271
ἐστρατήγει δὲ αὐτῶν Λακεδαιμόνιός τε ὁ Κίμωνος καὶ Διότιμος ὁ Στρομβίχου καὶ Πρωτέας ὁ Ἐπικλέους .
The commanders of them were Lacedaemonius, the son of Cimon, Diotimus, the son of Strombichus, and Proteas, the son of Epiclees.

1.45.3
272
προεῖπον δὲ αὐτοῖς μὴ ναυμαχεῖν Κορινθίοις , ἢν μὴ ἐπὶ Κέρκυραν πλέωσι καὶ μέλλωσιν ἀποβαίνειν ἢ ἐς τῶν ἐκείνων τι χωρίων ·
They charged them not to engage with the Corinthians, unless they should sail against Corcyra, and threaten to land, or against any of the places belonging to them; but in that case to prevent them to their utmost.

1.45.3
273
οὕτω δὲ κωλύειν κατὰ δύναμιν .
And to prevent them to their utmost.

1.45.3
274
προεῖπον δὲ ταῦτα τοῦ μὴ λύειν ἕνεκα τὰς σπονδάς .
And this charge they gave them with a view to not breaking the treaty.

1.46.1
275
αἱ μὲν δὴ νῆες ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν , οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι , ἐπειδὴ αὐτοῖς παρεσκεύαστο , ἔπλεον ἐπὶ τὴν Κέρκυραν ναυσὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατόν .
So the ships arrive at Corcyra. But the Corinthians, when they had made their preparations, set sail against Corcyra with a hundred and fifty ships.

1.46.1
276
ἦσαν δὲ Ἠλείων μὲν δέκα , Μεγαρέων δὲ δ

1.46.2
277
στρατηγοὶ δὲ τούτων ἦσαν μὲν καὶ κατὰ πόλεις ἑκάστων , Κορινθίων δὲ Ξενοκλείδης ὁ Εὐθυκλέους πέμπτος αὐτός .
In command of these there were different men for the different forces according to their states, and of the Corinthians, Xenoclides, the son of Euthycles, with four others.

1.46.3
278
ἐπειδὴ δὲ προσέμειξαν τῇ κατὰ Κέρκυραν ἠπείρῳ ἀπὸ Λευκάδος πλέοντες , ὁρμίζονται ἐς Χειμέριον τῆς Θεσπρωτίδος γῆς .
And when, in their course from Leucas, they made land on the continent opposite Corcyra, they came to anchor at Chimerium in the territory of Thesprotis.

1.46.4
279
ἔστι δὲ λιμήν , καὶ πόλις ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ κεῖται ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἐν τῇ Ἐλαιάτιδι τῆς Θεσπρωτίδος Ἐφύρη .
It is a harbour, and a city named Ephyre lies beyond it, away from the sea, in the Elean district of Thesprotis.

1.46.4
280
ἐξίησι δὲ παρ’ αὐτὴν Ἀχερουσία λίμνη ἐς θάλασσαν ·
By it the Acherusian lake empties itself into the sea.

1.46.4
281
διὰ δὲ τῆς Θεσπρωτίδος Ἀχέρων ποταμὸς ῥέων ἐσβάλλει ἐς αὐτήν , ἀφ’ οὗ καὶ τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχει .
And into this lake the river Acheron, which flows through Thesprotis, empties itself; from which also it takes its name.

1.46.4
282
ῥεῖ δὲ καὶ Θύαμις ποταμός , ὁρίζων τὴν Θεσπρωτίδα καὶ Κεστρίνην , ὧν ἐντὸς ἡ ἄκρα ἀνέχει τὸ Χειμέριον .
The river Thyamis also flows there, bounding Thesprotis and Cestrine; and between these rivers the promontory of Chimerium rises.

1.46.5
283
οἱ μὲν οὖν Κορίνθιοι τῆς ἠπείρου ἐνταῦθα ὁρμίζονταί τε καὶ στρατόπεδον ἐποιήσαντο .
The Corinthians then came to anchor at that part of the continent, and formed their encampment.

1.47.1
284
οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι ὡς ᾔσθοντο αὐτοὺς προσπλέοντας , πληρώσαντες δ

1.47.1
285
καὶ αἱ Ἀττικαὶ δέκα παρῆσαν .
And the ten Athenian ships were with them.

1.47.2
286
ἐπὶ δὲ τῇ Λευκίμμῃ αὐτοῖς τῷ ἀκρωτηρίῳ ὁ πεζὸς ἦν καὶ Ζακυνθίων χίλιοι ὁπλῖται βεβοηθηκότες .
And on the promontory of Leucimna was their land force, and a thousand heavy-armed of the Zacynthians, who had come to their assistance.

1.47.3
287
ἦσαν δὲ καὶ τοῖς Κορινθίοις ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ πολλοὶ τῶν βαρβάρων παραβεβοηθηκότες ·
The Corinthians also had on the mainland many of the barbarians, who had joined them to give assistance.

1.47.3
288
οἱ γὰρ ταύτῃ ἠπειρῶται αἰεί ποτε αὐτοῖς φίλοι εἰσίν .
For the people in that part of the continent have always been friendly with them.

1.48.1
289
ἐπειδὴ δὲ παρεσκεύαστο τοῖς Κορινθίοις , λαβόντες τριῶν ἡμερῶν σιτία ἀνήγοντο ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίαν ἀπὸ τοῦ Χειμερίου νυκτός , καὶ ἅμα ἕῳ πλέοντες καθορῶσι τὰς τῶν Κερκυραίων ναῦς μετεώρους τε καὶ ἐπὶ σφᾶς πλεούσας .
When the preparations of the Corinthians were made, taking three days' provision, they put out from Chimerium by night, with the purpose of engaging; and in the morning, while on their course, they observed the ships of the Corcyraeans out at sea, and sailing against them.

1.48.3
290
ὡς δὲ κατεῖδον ἀλλήλους , ἀντιπαρετάσσοντο , ἐπὶ μὲν τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας Κερκυραίων αἱ Ἀττικαὶ νῆες , τὸ δὲ ἄλλο αὐτοὶ ἐπεῖχον τρία τέλη ποιήσαντες τῶν νεῶν , ὧν ἦρχε τῶν τριῶν στρατηγῶν ἑκάστου εἷς .
And when they saw each other, they drew up in opposite lines of battle. On the right wing of the Corcyraeans were the Athenian ships, but the rest of the line they themselves occupied, having formed three squadrons of their ships, which were commanded each by one of the three generals.

1.48.4
291
οὕτω μὲν Κερκυραῖοι ἐτάξαντο , Κορινθίοις δὲ τὸ μὲν δεξιὸν κέρας αἱ Μεγαρίδες νῆες εἶχον καὶ αἱ Ἀμπρακιώτιδες , κατὰ δὲ τὸ μέσον οἱ ἄλλοι ξύμμαχοι ὡς ἕκαστοι ·
Thus, the Corcyraeans arranged their forces, and for the Corinthians, the right wing was held by the Megarian and Ambraciot ships, while the other allies occupied the center as each was assigned.

1.48.4
292
εὐώνυμον δὲ κέρας αὐτοὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι ταῖς ἄριστα τῶν νεῶν πλεούσαις κατὰ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ τὸ δεξιὸν τῶν Κερκυραίων εἶχον .
The left wing was held by the Corinthians themselves with their best ships, facing the Athenians and the right wing of the Corcyraeans.

1.49.1
293
ξυμμείξαντες δέ , ἐπειδὴ τὰ σημεῖα ἑκατέροις ἤρθη , ἐναυμάχουν , πολλοὺς μὲν ὁπλίτας ἔχοντες ἀμφότεροι ἐπὶ τῶν καταστρωμάτων , πολλοὺς δὲ τοξότας τε καὶ ἀκοντιστάς , τῷ παλαιῷ τρόπῳ ἀπειρότερον ἔτι παρεσκευασμένοι .
Once engaged, after the signals were raised on both sides, they fought a naval battle, with both sides having many hoplites on the decks, and numerous archers and javelin throwers, equipped in the more ancient fashion.

1.49.2
294
ἦν τε ἡ ναυμαχία καρτερά , τῇ μὲν τέχνῃ οὐχ ὁμοίως , πεζομαχίᾳ δὲ τὸ πλέον προσφερὴς οὖσα .
The naval battle was intense, not so much in terms of skill, but more resembling a land battle.

1.49.3
295
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ προσβάλοιεν ἀλλήλοις , οὐ ῥᾳδίως ἀπελύοντο ὑπό τε τοῦ πλήθους καὶ ὄχλου τῶν νεῶν , καὶ μᾶλλόν τι πιστεύοντες τοῖς ἐπὶ τοῦ καταστρώματος ὁπλίταις ἐς τὴν νίκην , οἳ καταστάντες ἐμάχοντ

1.49.3
296
διέκπλοι δ’ οὐκ ἦσαν , ἀλλὰ θυμῷ καὶ ῥώμῃ τὸ πλέον ἐναυμάχουν ἢ ἐπιστήμῃ .
There were no breakthroughs in the line, but they fought more with spirit and strength than with technical skill.

1.49.4
297
πανταχῇ μὲν οὖν πολὺς θόρυβος καὶ ταραχώδης ἦν ἡ ναυμαχία , ἐν ᾗ αἱ Ἀττικαὶ νῆες παραγιγνόμεναι τοῖς Κερκυραίοις , εἴ πῃ πιέζοιντο , φόβον μὲν παρεῖχον τοῖς ἐναντίοις , μάχης δὲ οὐκ ἦρχον δεδιότες οἱ στρατηγοὶ τὴν πρόρρησιν τῶν Ἀθηναίων .
The naval battle was tumultuous and chaotic throughout. The Athenian ships, assisting the Corcyraeans wherever they were pressed, provided fear to the opposing side but did not initiate combat, as the commanders were cautious of the Athenians' instructions.

1.49.5
298
μάλιστα δὲ τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας τῶν Κορινθίων ἐπόνει ·
It was the right wing of the Corinthians which was most distressed.

1.49.5
299
οἱ γὰρ Κερκυραῖοι εἴκοσι ναυσὶν αὐτοὺς τρεψάμενοι καὶ καταδιώξαντες σποράδας ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον καὶ μέχρι τοῦ στρατοπέδου πλεύσαντες αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπεκβάντες ἐνέπρησάν τε τὰς σκηνὰς ἐρήμους καὶ τὰ χρήματα διήρπασαν .
For the Corcyraeans with twenty ships having routed and pursued them in a scattered condition to the continent, sailed up to their encampment, and having made a descent upon them, burnt the deserted tents, and plundered their goods.

1.49.6
300
ταύτῃ μὲν οὖν οἱ Κορίνθιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἡσσῶντό τε καὶ οἱ Κερκυραῖοι ἐπεκράτουν ·
On that side then the Corinthians and their allies were worsted, and the Corcyraeans were victorious.

1.49.6
301
ᾗ δὲ αὐτοὶ ἦσαν οἱ Κορίνθιοι , ἐπὶ τῷ εὐωνύμῳ , πολὺ ἐνίκων , τοῖς Κερκυραίοις τῶν εἴκοσι νεῶν ἀπὸ ἐλάσσονος πλήθους ἐκ τῆς διώξεως οὐ παρουσῶν .
But where the Corinthians themselves were, on the left, they had a decided victory, as twenty ships of the Corcyraeans, from a number [originally] smaller, had not returned from the pursuit.

1.49.7
302
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ὁρῶντες τοὺς Κερκυραίους πιεζομένους μᾶλλον ἤδη ἀπροφασίστως ἐπεκούρουν , τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἀπεχόμενοι ὥστε μὴ ἐμβάλλειν τινί ·
But the Athenians, seeing the Corcyraeans hard pressed, assisted them now more unequivocally, though at first they refrained from charging any vessel.

1.49.7
303
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἡ τροπὴ ἐγίγνετο λαμπρῶς καὶ ἐνέκειντο οἱ Κορίνθιοι , τότε δὴ ἔργου πᾶς εἴχετο ἤδη καὶ διεκέκριτο οὐδὲν ἔτι , ἀλλὰ ξυνέπεσεν ἐς τοῦτο ἀνάγκης ὥστε ἐπιχειρῆσαι ἀλλήλοις τοὺς Κορινθίους καὶ Ἀθηναίους .
but when the rout had clearly taken place, and the Corinthians were lying close on them, then indeed every one at length set to work, and there was no longer any distinction, but it had come to such urgent necessity, that the Corinthians and Athenians attacked each other.

1.50.1
304
τῆς δὲ τροπῆς γενομένης οἱ Κορίνθιοι τὰ σκάφη μὲν οὐχ εἷλκον ἀναδούμενοι τῶν νεῶν ἃς καταδύσειαν , πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἐτράποντο φονεύειν διεκπλέοντες μᾶλλον ἢ ζωγρεῖν , τούς τε αὑτῶν φίλους , οὐκ ᾐσθημένοι ὅτι ἥσσηντο οἱ ἐπὶ τῷ δεξιῷ κέρᾳ , ἀγνοοῦντες ἔκτεινον .
Now when the rout had taken place, the Corinthians did not take in tow and haul off the hulls of the vessels which they might happen to have sunk, [*] but turned their attention to the men, sailing throughout to butcher, rather than to make prisoners; and some of their own friends, not being aware that those in the right wing had been worsted, they unwittingly killed.

1.50.2
305
πολλῶν γὰρ νεῶν οὐσῶν ἀμφοτέρων καὶ ἐπὶ πολὺ τῆς θαλάσσης ἐπεχουσῶν , ἐπειδὴ ξυνέμειξαν ἀλλήλοις , οὐ ῥᾳδίως τὴν διάγνωσιν ἐποιοῦντο ὁποῖοι ἐκράτουν ἢ ἐκρατοῦντο ·
For as both fleets were numerous, and extended over a wide space of the sea; when they closed with each other, they did not easily distinguish, who were conquering, or being conquered;

1.50.2
306
ναυμαχία γὰρ αὕτη Ἕλλησι πρὸς Ἕλληνας νεῶν πλήθει μεγίστη δὴ τῶν πρὸ αὑτῆς γεγένηται .
for this engagement, for one of Greeks against Greeks, was greater in the number of vessels than any of those before it.

1.50.3
307
ἐπειδὴ δὲ κατεδίωξαν τοὺς Κερκυραίους οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἐς τὴν γῆν , πρὸς τὰ ναυάγια καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς τοὺς σφετέρους ἐτράποντο , καὶ τῶν πλείστων ἐκράτησαν ὥστε προσκομίσαι πρὸς τὰ Σύβοτα , οἷ αὐτοῖς ὁ κατὰ γῆν στρατὸς τῶν βαρβάρων προσεβεβοηθήκει ·
After the Corinthians had pursued the Corcyraeans to land, they turned their attention to the wrecks, and their own dead, and got possession of most of them, so as to take them to Sybota, where their land force composed of the barbarians had come to their assistance. Now Sybota is a desert port of Thesprotis.

1.50.3
308
ἔστι δὲ τὰ Σύβοτα τῆς Θεσπρωτίδος λιμὴν ἐρῆμος .
Sybota is a deserted harbor of Thesprotis.

1.50.3
309
τοῦτο δὲ ποιήσαντες αὖθις ἁθροισθέντες ἐπέπλεον τοῖς Κερκυραίοις .
Having done this, they mustered again, and sailed against the Corcyraeans.

1.50.4
310
οἱ δὲ ταῖς πλωίμοις καὶ ὅσαι ἦσαν λοιπαὶ μετὰ τῶν Ἀττικῶν νεῶν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀντεπέπλεον , δείσαντες μὴ ἐς τὴν γῆν σφῶν πειρῶσιν ἀποβαίνειν .
The Corcyraeans, with their seaworthy ships and such as were left, in conjunction with those of the Athenians, also sailed out to meet them, fearing lest they should attempt to land on their territory.

1.50.5
311
ἤδη δὲ ἦν ὀψὲ καὶ ἐπεπαιάνιστο αὐτοῖς ὡς ἐς ἐπίπλουν , καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἐξαπίνης πρύμναν ἐκρούοντο κατιδόντες εἴκοσι ναῦς Ἀθηναίων προσπλεούσας , ἃς ὕστερον τῶν δέκα βοηθοὺς ἐξέπεμψαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , δείσαντες , ὅπερ ἐγένετο , μὴ νικηθῶσιν οἱ Κερκυραῖοι καὶ αἱ σφέτεραι δέκα νῆες ὀλίγαι ἀμύνειν ὦσιν .
It was now late, and the Paean had been sung by them for the advance, when the Corinthians suddenly began to row sternwards, on observing twenty ships of the Athenians sailing up; which the Athenians had sent after the ten to help them fearing, (as was the case,) that the Corcyraeans might be conquered, and their own ten ships be too few to aid them.

1.51.1
312
ταύτας οὖν προϊδόντες οἱ Κορίνθιοι καὶ ὑποτοπήσαντες ἀπ’ Ἀθηνῶν εἶναι οὐχ ὅσας ἑώρων ἀλλὰ πλείους ὑπανεχώρουν .
These, then, the Corinthians having first seen, and suspecting that they were from Athens, and were not merely as many as they saw, but more, began to retreat.

1.51.2
313
τοῖς δὲ Κερκυραίοις ἐπέπλεον γὰρ μᾶλλον ἐκ τοῦ ἀφανοῦς οὐχ ἑωρῶντο , καὶ ἐθαύμαζον τοὺς Κορινθίους πρύμναν κρουομένους , πρίν τινες ἰδόντες εἶπον ὅτι νῆες ἐκεῖναι ἐπιπλέουσιν .
But by the Corcyraeans they were not seen, (for they were advancing more out of their view,) and they wondered at the Corinthians rowing astern, till some saw them and said, "There are ships yonder sailing towards us."

1.51.2
314
τότε δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀνεχώρουν ·
Then they also withdrew;

1.51.2
315
ξυνεσκόταζε γὰρ ἤδη , καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἀποτραπόμενοι τὴν διάλυσιν ἐποιήσαντο .
for it was already growing dark, and the Corinthians, turning about, effected their disengagement.

1.51.3
316
οὕτω μὲν ἡ ἀπαλλαγὴ ἐγένετο ἀλλήλων , καὶ ἡ ναυμαχία ἐτελεύτα ἐς νύκτα .
In this way they parted from each other, and the battle ceased at night.

1.51.4
317
τοῖς δὲ Κερκυραίοις στρατοπεδευομένοις ἐπὶ τῇ Λευκίμμῃ αἱ εἴκοσι νῆες αἱ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν αὗται , ὧν ἦρχε Γλαύκων τε ὁ Λεάγρου καὶ † Ἀνδοκίδης ὁ Λεωγόρου † , διὰ τῶν νεκρῶν καὶ ναυαγίων προσκομισθεῖσαι κατέπλεον ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον ἢ ὤφθησαν .
And when the Corcyraeans were encamped on Leucimna, these twenty ships from Athens, which were commanded by Glauco, the son of Leager, and Andocides, the son of Leogoras, coming on through the dead bodies and the wrecks, sailed up to the camp not long after they had been descried.

1.51.5
318
οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι ( ἦν γὰρ νύξ ) ἐφοβήθησαν μὴ πολέμιαι ὦσιν , ἔπειτα δὲ ἔγνωσαν ·
Now the Corcyraeans (it being night) were afraid they might be enemies; but afterwards they recognized them,

1.51.5
319
καὶ ὡρμίσαντο .
and they came to anchor.

1.52.1
320
τῇ δὲ ὑστεραίᾳ ἀναγαγόμεναι αἵ τε Ἀττικαὶ τριάκοντα νῆες καὶ τῶν Κερκυραίων ὅσαι πλώιμοι ἦσαν ἐπέπλευσαν ἐπὶ τὸν ἐν τοῖς Συβότοις λιμένα , ἐν ᾧ οἱ Κορίνθιοι ὥρμουν , βουλόμενοι εἰδέναι εἰ ναυμαχήσουσιν .
The next day the thirty Athenian ships, and as many of the Corcyraean as were sea-worthy, put out and sailed to the harbour at Sybota, in which the Corinthians were anchored, wishing to know whether they would engage.

1.52.2
321
οἱ δὲ τὰς μὲν ναῦς ἄραντες ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ παραταξάμενοι μετεώρους ἡσύχαζον , ναυμαχίας οὐ διανοούμενοι ἄρχειν ἑκόντες ὁρῶντες προσγεγενημένας τε ναῦς ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ἀκραιφνεῖς καὶ σφίσι πολλὰ τὰ ἄπορα ξυμβεβηκότα , αἰχμαλώτων τε περὶ φυλακῆς οὓς ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶν εἶχον , καὶ ἐπισκευὴν οὐκ οὖσαν τῶν νεῶν ἐν χωρίῳ ἐρήμῳ ·
But the Corinthians, after raising their ships from the land and forming them in line at sea, remained quiet, not intending voluntarily to begin a battle upon seeing the newly arrived and fresh ships from Athens, and also because they themselves were facing many difficulties, with the guarding of the prisoners they had on board their ships and the lack of means to refit their vessels in such a deserted area.

1.52.3
322
τοῦ δὲ οἴκαδε πλοῦ μᾶλλον διεσκόπουν ὅπῃ κομισθήσονται , δεδιότες μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι νομίσαντες λελύσθαι τὰς σπονδάς , διότι ἐς χεῖρας ἦλθον , οὐκ ἐῶσι σφᾶς ἀποπλεῖν .
They were thinking more about their homeward journey, how they would manage it, fearing that the Athenians might think the treaty had been broken because they had come to blows, and might not allow them to sail away.

1.53.1
323
ἔδοξεν οὖν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρας ἐς κελήτιον ἐσβιβάσαντας ἄνευ κηρυκείου προσπέμψαι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ πεῖραν ποιήσασθαι .
So they decided to put some men on a skiff and send them, without a herald's wand, to the Athenians to see what would happen.

1.53.1
324
πέμψαντές τε ἔλεγον τοιάδε .
Having sent them, they said the following.

1.53.2
325
" ἀδικεῖτε , ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι , πολέμου ἄρχοντες καὶ σπονδὰς λύοντες ·
"You are doing wrong, men of Athens, by starting a war and breaking the truce.

1.53.2
326
ἡμῖν γὰρ πολεμίους τοὺς ἡμετέρους τιμωρουμένοις ἐμποδὼν ἵστασθε ὅπλα ἀνταιρόμενοι .
For you are getting in our way and raising arms against us while we are punishing our enemies.

1.53.2
327
εἰ δ’ ὑμῖν γνώμη ἐστὶ κωλύειν τε ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ Κέρκυραν ἢ ἄλλοσε εἴ ποι βουλόμεθα πλεῖν καὶ τὰς σπονδὰς λύετε , ἡμᾶς τούσδε πρώτους λαβόντες χρήσασθε ὡς πολεμίοις " .
If you intend to prevent us from sailing to Corcyra or wherever else we choose and to break the truce, then seize us first and treat us as enemies."

1.53.3
328
οἱ μὲν δὴ τοιαῦτα εἶπον ·
They said this.

1.53.3
329
τῶν δὲ Κερκυραίων τὸ μὲν στρατόπεδον ὅσον ἐπήκουσεν ἀνεβόησεν εὐθὺς λαβεῖν τε αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀποκτεῖναι , οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι τοι

1.53.4
330
" οὔτε ἄρχομεν πολέμου , ὦ ἄνδρες Πελοποννήσιοι , οὔτε τὰς σπονδὰς λύομεν , Κερκυραίοις δὲ τοῖσδε ξυμμάχοις οὖσι βοηθοὶ ἤλθομεν .
"We are not starting a war, men of Peloponnese, nor breaking the truce; but we have come to help these Corcyraeans, who are our allies.

1.53.4
331
εἰ μὲν οὖν ἄλλοσέ ποι βούλεσθε πλεῖν , οὐ κωλύομεν ·
If you want to sail somewhere else, we will not prevent you.

1.53.4
332
εἰ δὲ ἐπὶ Κέρκυραν πλευσεῖσθε ἢ ἐς τῶν ἐκείνων τι χωρίων , οὐ περιοψόμεθα κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν " .
But if you sail against Corcyra or any of their territories, we shall do our best to prevent you."

1.54.1
333
τοιαῦτα τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀποκριναμένων οἱ μὲν Κορίνθιοι τόν τε πλοῦν τὸν ἐπ’ οἴκου παρεσκευάζοντο καὶ τροπαῖον ἔστησαν ἐν τοῖς ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ Συβότοις ·
After the Athenians responded, the Corinthians began preparing for their homeward journey and erected a trophy at Sybota on the mainland.

1.54.1
334
οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι τά τε ναυάγια καὶ νεκροὺς ἀνείλοντο τὰ κατὰ σφᾶς ἐξενεχθέντα ὑπό τε τοῦ ῥοῦ καὶ ἀνέμου , ὃς γενόμενος τῆς νυκτὸς διεσκέδασεν αὐτὰ πανταχῇ , καὶ τροπαῖον ἀντέστησαν ἐν τοῖς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ Συβότοις ὡς νενικηκότες .
The Corcyraeans collected the wreckage and the bodies of their own side that had been carried out by the current and wind, which had arisen during the night and scattered them all over, and they erected a counter-trophy at Sybota on the island, claiming victory.

1.54.2
335
γνώμῃ δὲ τοιᾷδε ἑκάτεροι τὴν νίκην προσεποιήσαντο ·
Both sides claimed victory for the following reasons:

1.54.2
336
Κορίνθιοι μὲν κρατήσαντες τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ μέχρι νυκτός , ὥστε καὶ ναυάγια πλεῖστα καὶ νεκροὺς προσκομίσασθαι , καὶ ἄνδρας ἔχοντες αἰχμαλώτους οὐκ ἐλάσσους χιλίων ναῦς τε καταδύσαντες περὶ ἑβδομήκοντα ἔστησαν τροπαῖον ·
The Corinthians claimed victory because they had dominated the naval battle until nightfall, managed to recover most of the wrecks and dead bodies, had prisoners numbering not less than a thousand, and sunk about seventy ships, leading them to erect a trophy.

1.54.2
337
Κερκυραῖοι δὲ τριάκοντα ναῦς μάλιστα διαφθείραντες , καὶ ἐπειδὴ Ἀθηναῖοι ἦλθον , ἀνελόμενοι τὰ κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ναυάγια καὶ νεκρούς , καὶ ὅτι αὐτοῖς τῇ τε προτεραίᾳ πρύμναν κρουόμενοι ὑπεχώρησαν οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἰδόντες τὰς Ἀττικὰς ναῦς , καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἦλθον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , οὐκ ἀντεπέπλεον ἐκ τῶν Συβότων , διὰ ταῦτα τροπαῖον ἔστησαν .
The Corcyraeans, however, also claimed victory because they had destroyed about thirty ships, and after the arrival of the Athenians, they recovered the wrecks and dead bodies of their own side. They also noted that the Corinthians had retreated sternwards the day before upon seeing the Athenian ships, and after the arrival of the Athenians, the Corinthians did not sail out from Sybota to engage them, leading them to erect a trophy as well.

1.55.1
338
οὕτω μὲν ἑκάτεροι νικᾶν ἠξίουν ·
Thus both sides claimed to be the victors.

1.55.1
339
οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι ἀποπλέοντες ἐπ’ οἴκου Ἀνακτόριον , ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ Ἀμπρακικοῦ κόλπου , εἷλον ἀπάτῃ ( ἦν δὲ κοινὸν Κερκυραίων καὶ ἐκείνων ) καὶ καταστήσαντες ἐν αὐτῷ Κορινθίους οἰκήτορας ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου , καὶ τῶν Κερκυραίων ὀκτακοσίους μὲν οἳ ἦσαν δοῦλοι ἀπέδοντο , πεντήκοντα δὲ καὶ διακοσίους δήσαντες ἐφύλασσον καὶ ἐν θεραπείᾳ εἶχον πολλῇ , ὅπως αὐτοῖς τὴν Κέρκυραν ἀναχωρήσαντες προσποιήσειαν ·
As the Corinthians were sailing homeward, they treacherously captured Anactorium, which is located at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf and was a shared possession of the Corcyraeans and themselves. They established Corinthian inhabitants there and then continued their journey home. Of the Corcyraeans, they released eight hundred who were slaves and kept two hundred and fifty bound, treating them very well, so that they might win Corcyra over to their side upon their return.

1.55.1
340
ἐτύγχανον δὲ καὶ δυνάμει αὐτῶν οἱ πλείους πρῶτοι ὄντες τῆς πόλεως .
Most of these were among the most powerful individuals in the city.

1.55.2
341
ἡ μὲν οὖν Κέρκυρα οὕτω περιγίγνεται τῷ πολέμῳ τῶν Κορινθίων , καὶ αἱ νῆες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀνεχώρησαν ἐξ αὐτῆς ·
Corcyra then in this way outlived the war with the Corinthians; and the ships of the Athenians returned from it.

1.55.2
342
αἰτία δὲ αὕτη πρώτη ἐγένετο τοῦ πολέμου τοῖς Κορινθίοις ἐς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , ὅτι σφίσιν ἐν σπονδαῖς μετὰ Κερκυραίων ἐναυμάχουν .
This was the first ground the Corinthians had for their war against the Athenians, namely, that in time of peace they had fought with them by sea in conjunction with the Corcyraeans.

1.56.1
343
μετὰ ταῦτα δ’ εὐθὺς καὶ τάδε ξυνέβη γενέσθαι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Πελοποννησίοις διάφορα ἐς τὸ πολεμεῖν .
Immediately after this the following disagreements arose between the Athenians and Peloponnesians, to lead them to war.

1.56.2
344
τῶν γὰρ Κορινθίων πρασσόντων ὅπως τιμωρήσονται αὐτούς , ὑποτοπήσαντες τὴν ἔχθραν αὐτῶν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι Ποτειδεάτας , οἳ οἰκοῦσιν ἐπὶ τῷ ἰσθμῷ τῆς Παλλήνης , Κορινθίων ἀποίκους , ἑαυτῶν δὲ ξυμμάχους φόρου ὑποτελεῖς , ἐκέλευον τὸ ἐς Παλλήνην τεῖχος καθελεῖν καὶ ὁμήρους δοῦναι , τούς τε ἐπιδημιουργοὺς ἐκπέμπειν καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν μὴ δέχεσθαι οὓς κατὰ ἔτος ἕκαστον Κορίνθιοι ἔπεμπον , δείσαντες μὴ ἀποστῶσιν ὑπό τε Περδίκκου πειθόμενοι καὶ Κορινθίων , τούς τε ἄλλους τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ξυναποστήσωσι ξυμμάχους .
While the Corinthians were contriving how to avenge themselves on them, the Athenians, suspecting their hostility, ordered the Potidaeans, who live on the isthmus of Pallene, being colonists of the Corinthians, but their own subjects and tributaries, to throw down the wall towards Pallene, and give hostages; and to dismiss, and not receive in future, the magistrates [*] whom the Corinthians used to send every year; being afraid that they might revolt at the instigation of Perdiccas and the Corinthians, and lead the rest of their allies Thrace-ward [*] to revolt with them.

1.57.1
345
ταῦτα δὲ περὶ τοὺς Ποτειδεάτας οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι προπαρεσκευάζοντο εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν ἐν Κερκύρᾳ ναυμαχίαν ·
These precautionary measures with regard to the Potidaeans the Athenians began to adopt immediately after the sea-fight at Corcyra.

1.57.2
346
οἵ τε γὰρ Κορίνθιοι φανερῶς ἤδη διάφοροι ἦσαν , Περδίκκας τε ὁ Ἀλεξάνδρου Μακεδόνων βασιλεὺς ἐπεπολέμωτο ξύμμαχος πρότερον καὶ φίλος ὤν .
For the Corinthians were now openly at variance with then; and Perdiccas the son of Alexander, king of the Macedonians, had been made their enemy, though he was before an ally and a friend.

1.57.3
347
ἐπολεμώθη δὲ ὅτι Φιλίππῳ τῷ ἑαυτοῦ ἀδελφῷ καὶ Δέρδᾳ κοινῇ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐναντιουμένοις οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ξυμμαχίαν ἐποιήσαντο .
He became such, because the Athenians had made an alliance with his brother Philip and Derdas, when acting together against him.

1.57.4
348
δεδιώς τε ἔπρασσεν ἔς τε τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πέμπων ὅπως πόλεμος γένηται αὐτοῖς πρὸς Πελοποννησίους , καὶ τοὺς Κορινθίους προσεποιεῖτο τῆς Ποτειδαίας ἕνεκα ἀποστάσεως ·
And being alarmed, he both sent to Lacedaemon, and tried to contrive that they might be involved in war with the Peloponnesians, and endeavoured to win over the Corinthians, with a view to Potidaea's revolting.

1.57.5
349
προσέφερε δὲ λόγους καὶ τοῖς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης Χαλκιδεῦσι καὶ Βοττιαίοις ξυναποστῆναι , νομίζων , εἰ ξύμμαχα ταῦτα ἔχοι ὅμορα ὄντα τὰ χωρία , ῥᾷον ἂν τὸν πόλεμον μετ’ αὐτῶν ποιεῖσθαι .
He also made proposals also to the Thrace-ward Chalcidians and the Bottiaeans to join in the revolt, thinking that if he had in alliance with him these places on his borders, he should more easily carry on the war in conjunction with them.

1.57.6
350
ὧν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι αἰσθόμενοι καὶ βουλόμενοι προκαταλαμβάνειν τῶν πόλεων τὰς ἀποστάσεις ( ἔτυχον γὰρ τριάκοντα ναῦς ἀποστέλλοντες καὶ χιλίους ὁπλίτας ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ , Ἀρχεστράτου τοῦ Λυκομήδους μετ’ ἄλλων † δέκα † στρατηγοῦντος ) ἐπιστέλλουσι τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν νεῶν Ποτειδεατῶν τε ὁμήρους λαβεῖν καὶ τὸ τεῖχος καθελεῖν , τῶν τε πλησίον πόλεων φυλακὴν ἔχειν ὅπως μὴ ἀποστήσονται .
The Athenians perceiving these things, and wishing to anticipate the revolt of the cities, as they happened to be sending out thirty ships and a thousand heavy-armed against his country, with Archestratus, the son of Lycomedes, as general with ten others, gave orders to the commanders of the fleet to take hostages of the Potidaeans, and throw down the wall, and keep a watchful eye over the neighbouring cities, to prevent their revolting.

1.58.1
351
Ποτειδεᾶται δὲ πέμψαντες μὲν καὶ παρ’ Ἀθηναίους πρέσβεις , εἴ πως πείσειαν μὴ σφῶν πέρι νεωτερίζειν μηδέν , ἐλθόντες δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα μετὰ Κορινθίων , ἔπρασσον ὅπως ἑτοιμάσαιντο τιμωρίαν , ἢν δέῃ ,
Now the Potidaeans sent ambassadors to the Athenians, to try if by any means they might persuade them to adopt no new measures against them; and went also to Lacedaemon in company with the Corinthians, to provide themselves with assistance, should it be necessary;

1.58.2
352
καὶ Περδίκκας πείθει Χαλκιδέας τὰς ἐπὶ θαλάσσῃ πόλεις ἐκλιπόντας καὶ καταβαλόντας ἀνοικίσασθαι ἐς Ὄλυνθον μίαν τε πόλιν ταύτην ἰσχυρὰν ποιήσασθαι ·
And Perdiccas persuaded the Chalcidians to abandon and throw down their cities on the sea, and remove inland to Olynthus, and make that one city a place of strength for themselves.

1.58.2
353
τοῖς τ’ ἐκλιποῦσι τούτοις τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γῆς τῆς Μυγδονίας περὶ τὴν Βόλβην λίμνην ἔδωκε νέμεσθαι , ἕως ἂν ὁ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους πόλεμος ᾖ .
And to those who abandoned them he gave a part of his own territory in Mygdonia, round lake Bolbe, to enjoy as long as the war with the Athenians lasted. And so, throwing down their cities, they removed inland, and prepared for war.

1.58.2
354
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀνῳκίζοντό τε καθαιροῦντες τὰς πόλεις καὶ ἐς πόλεμον παρεσκευάζοντο· They accordingly demolished their towns, removed inland, and prepared for war.

1.59.1
355
αἱ δὲ τριάκοντα νῆες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης , καὶ καταλαμβάνουσι τήν τε Ποτείδαιαν καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἀφεστηκότα .
The thirty ships of the Athenians arrived at the Thraceward towns, and found Potidaea and the rest in revolt:

1.59.2
356
νομίσαντες δὲ οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἀδύνατα εἶναι πρός τε Περδίκκαν πολεμεῖν τῇ παρούσῃ δυνάμει καὶ τὰ ξυναφεστῶτα χωρία τρέπονται ἐπὶ τὴν Μακεδονίαν , ἐφ’ ὅπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἐξεπέμποντο , καὶ καταστάντες ἐπολέμουν μετὰ Φιλίππου καὶ τῶν Δέρδου ἀδελφῶν ἄνωθεν στρατιᾷ ἐσβεβληκότων .
The generals, thinking it impractical to wage war against Perdiccas with their present force and the territories they had already acquired, turned towards Macedonia, which was their original mission, and established themselves there, engaging in warfare alongside Philip and the brothers of Derdas who had brought an army from the interior.

1.60.1
357
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ οἱ Κορίνθιοι , τῆς Ποτειδαίας ἀφεστηκυίας καὶ τῶν Ἀττικῶν νεῶν περὶ Μακεδονίαν οὐσῶν , δεδιότες περὶ τῷ χωρίῳ καὶ οἰκεῖον τὸν κίνδυνον ἡγούμενοι πέμπουσιν ἑαυτῶν τε ἐθελοντὰς καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Πελοποννησίων μισθῷ πείσαντες ἑξακοσίους καὶ χιλίους τοὺς πάντας ὁπλίτας καὶ ψιλοὺς τετρακοσίους .
Meanwhile, the Corinthians, with Potidaea having revolted and the Athenian navy around Macedonia, fearful for the territory and considering the risk as their own, sent both their own volunteers and hired soldiers from other Peloponnesian states, totaling sixteen hundred heavy infantry and four hundred light infantry.

1.60.2
358
ἐστρατήγει δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀριστεὺς ὁ Ἀδειμάντου , κατὰ φιλίαν τε αὐτοῦ οὐχ ἥκιστα οἱ πλεῖστοι ἐκ Κορίνθου στρατιῶται ἐθελονταὶ ξυνέσποντο ·
Their forces were led by Aristeus, son of Adeimantus. Due to his popularity, many soldiers from Corinth voluntarily joined the expedition.

1.60.2
359
ἦν γὰρ τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις αἰεί ποτε ἐπιτήδειος .
He had always been a favorable figure to the Potidaeans.

1.60.3
360
καὶ ἀφικνοῦνται τεσσαρακοστῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὕστερον ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ἢ Ποτείδαια ἀπέστη .
They arrived in Thrace forty days after Potidaea had revolted.

1.61.1
361
ἦλθε δὲ καὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις εὐθὺς ἡ ἀγγελία τῶν πόλεων ὅτι ἀφεστᾶσι , καὶ πέμπουσιν , ὡς ᾔσθοντο καὶ τοὺς μετ’ Ἀριστέως ἐπιπαριόντας , δισχιλίους ἑαυτῶν ὁπλίτας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς πρὸς τὰ ἀφεστῶτα , καὶ Καλλίαν τὸν Καλλιάδου πέμπτον αὐτὸν στρατηγόν , οἳ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Μακεδονίαν πρῶτον καταλαμβάνουσι τοὺς προτέρους χιλίους Θέρμην ἄρτι ᾑρηκότας καὶ Πύδναν πολιορκοῦντας .
Upon receiving the news of the cities' revolt, the Athenians immediately sent two thousand of their own heavy infantry and forty ships to the revolted areas, appointing Callias, son of Calliades, as their general. Upon arrival in Macedonia, they first captured the previously dispatched thousand men who had just seized Therme and were besieging Pydna.

1.61.3
362
προσκαθεζόμενοι δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ τὴν Πύδναν ἐπολιόρκησαν μέν , ἔπειτα δὲ ξύμβασιν ποιησάμενοι καὶ ξυμμαχίαν ἀναγκαίαν πρὸς τὸν Περδίκκαν , ὡς αὐτοὺς κατήπειγεν ἡ Ποτείδαια καὶ ὁ Ἀριστεὺς παρεληλυθώς , ἀπανίστανται ἐκ τῆς Μακεδονίας ,
So they also sat down before Pydna, and besieged it; but afterwards, having made terms and a compulsory alliance [*] with Perdiccas, as they were hurried on by Potidaea and the arrival of Aristeus there, they withdrew from Macedonia;

1.61.4
363
ἅμα δὲ νῆες παρέπλεον ἑβδομήκοντα .
At the same time seventy ships were sailing in a line with them.

1.61.5
364
κατ’ ὀλίγον δὲ προϊόντες τριταῖοι ἀφίκοντο ἐς Γίγωνον καὶ ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο .
And advancing by short marches, they arrived at Gigonus, and pitched their camp.

1.62.1
365
Ποτειδεᾶται δὲ καὶ οἱ μετὰ Ἀριστέως Πελοποννήσιοι προσδεχόμενοι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο πρὸς Ὀλύνθου ἐν τῷ ἰσθμῷ , καὶ ἀγορὰν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως ἐπεποίηντο .
Now the Potidaeans and the Peloponnesians with Aristeus, in expectation of the Athenians, were encamped towards Olynthus, on the isthmus, and had established their market outside the city.

1.62.2
366
στρατηγὸν μὲν οὖν τοῦ πεζοῦ παντὸς οἱ ξύμμαχοι ᾕρηντο Ἀριστέα , τῆς δὲ ἵππου Περδίκκαν ·
As general of all the infantry, the allies had elected Aristeus, while Perdiccas was chosen for the cavalry.

1.62.2
367
ἀπέστη γὰρ εὐθὺς πάλιν τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ ξυνεμάχει τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις , Ἰόλαον ἀνθ’ αὑτοῦ καταστήσας ἄρχοντα .
Perdiccas had again immediately broken off from the Athenians and was in alliance with the Potidaeans, appointing Iolaus as his representative commander.

1.62.3
368
ἦν δὲ ἡ γνώμη τοῦ Ἀριστέως τὸ μὲν μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ στρατόπεδον ἔχοντι ἐν τῷ ἰσθμῷ ἐπιτηρεῖν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , ἢν ἐπίωσι , Χαλκιδέας δὲ καὶ τοὺς ἔξω ἰσθμοῦ ξυμμάχους καὶ τὴν παρὰ Περδίκκου διακοσίαν ἵππον ἐν Ὀλύνθῳ μένειν , καὶ ὅταν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ σφᾶς χωρῶσι , κατὰ νώτου βοηθοῦντας ἐν μέσῳ ποιεῖν αὑτῶν τοὺς πολεμίους .
Aristeus' strategy was to keep his own camp on the isthmus to monitor the Athenians should they approach. He proposed that the Chalcidians and allies outside the isthmus, along with Perdiccas' two hundred cavalry, should stay in Olynthus. If the Athenians advanced against them, they would come from behind to assist and trap the enemy in the middle.

1.62.4
369
Καλλίας δ’ αὖ ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγὸς καὶ οἱ ξυνάρχοντες τοὺς μὲν Μακεδόνας ἱππέας καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὀλίγους ἐπὶ Ὀλύνθου ἀποπέμπουσιν , ὅπως εἴργωσι τοὺς ἐκεῖθεν ἐπιβοηθεῖν , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀναστήσαντες τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐχώρουν ἐπὶ τὴν Ποτείδαιαν .
On the other hand, Callias, the Athenian general, and his co-commanders sent the Macedonian cavalry and a few of their allies towards Olynthus to prevent any assistance from there. They themselves then broke up the camp and advanced towards Potidaea.

1.62.5
370
καὶ ἐπειδὴ πρὸς τῷ ἰσθμῷ ἐγένοντο καὶ εἶδον τοὺς ἐναντίους παρασκευαζομένους ὡς ἐς μάχην , ἀντικαθίσταντο καὶ αὐτοί , καὶ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ξυνέμισγον .
Upon reaching the isthmus and seeing the enemy preparing for battle, the Athenians also took up a battle position, and soon the fight began.

1.62.6
371
καὶ αὐτὸ μὲν τὸ τοῦ Ἀριστέως κέρας καὶ ὅσοι περὶ ἐκεῖνον ἦσαν Κορινθίων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων λογάδες ἔτρεψαν τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς καὶ ἐπεξῆλθον διώκοντες ἐπὶ πολύ ·
Aristeus' wing, including the select troops from Corinth and others around him, managed to rout their opponents and pursued them for a considerable distance.

1.62.6
372
τὸ δὲ ἄλλο στρατόπεδον Ποτειδεατῶν καὶ Πελοποννησίων ἡσσᾶτο ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ ἐς τὸ τεῖχος κατέφυγεν .
However, the rest of the Potidaean and Peloponnesian camp was defeated by the Athenians and forced to retreat behind their walls for safety.

1.63.1
373
ἐπαναχωρῶν δὲ ὁ Ἀριστεὺς ἀπὸ τῆς διώξεως , ὡς ὁρᾷ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα ἡσσημένον , ἠπόρησε μὲν ὁποτέρωσε διακινδυνεύσῃ χωρήσας , ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς Ὀλύνθου ἢ ἐς τὴν Ποτείδαιαν ·
As Aristeus retreated from the pursuit and saw the rest of the army defeated, he was uncertain where to risk going, whether towards Olynthus or Potidaea.

1.63.1
374
ἔδοξε δ’ οὖν ξυναγαγόντι τοὺς μεθ’ αὑτοῦ ὡς ἐς ἐλάχιστον χωρίον δρόμῳ βιάσασθαι ἐς τὴν Ποτείδαιαν , καὶ παρῆλθε παρὰ τὴν χηλὴν διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης βαλλόμενός τε καὶ χαλεπῶς , ὀλίγους μέν τινας ἀποβαλών , τοὺς δὲ πλείους σώσας .
He decided to gather his men in the smallest possible space and force his way through to Potidaea, moving along the sea shore and enduring missile attacks; he lost a few men but managed to save most of them.

1.63.2
375
οἱ δ’ ἀπὸ τῆς Ὀλύνθου τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις βοηθοί ( ἀπέχει δὲ ἑξήκοντα μάλιστα σταδίους καὶ ἔστι καταφανές ) , ὡς ἡ μάχη ἐγίγνετο καὶ τὰ σημεῖα ἤρθη , βραχὺ μέν τι προῆλθον ὡς βοηθήσοντες , καὶ οἱ Μακεδόνες ἱππῆς ἀντιπαρετάξαντο ὡς κωλύσοντες ·
The allies of Potidaea from Olynthus, which is about sixty stadia away and visible, advanced a little during the battle when the signals were raised, intending to assist. The Macedonian cavalry confronted them to prevent their aid.

1.63.2
376
ἐπειδὴ δὲ διὰ τάχους ἡ νίκη τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐγίγνετο καὶ τὰ σημεῖα κατεσπάσθη , πάλιν ἐπανεχώρουν ἐς τὸ τεῖχος καὶ οἱ Μακεδόνες παρὰ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ·
But when the Athenians quickly secured victory and their signals were lowered, both the allies and the Macedonians retreated back within the walls, alongside the Athen
ians.

1.63.2
377
ἱππῆς δ’ οὐδετέροις παρεγένοντο .
Neither side had cavalry present in the engagement.

1.63.3
378
μετὰ δὲ τὴν μάχην τροπαῖον ἔστησαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις ·
After the battle, the Athenians erected a trophy and returned the dead under truce to the Potidaeans.

1.63.3
379
ἀπέθανον δὲ Ποτειδεατῶν μὲν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους τριακοσίων , Ἀθηναίων δὲ αὐτῶν πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν καὶ Καλλίας ὁ στρατηγός .
The casualties were nearly three hundred among the Potidaeans and their allies, and among the Athenians themselves, one hundred and fifty, including their general Callias.

1.64.1
380
τὸ δὲ ἐκ τοῦ ἰσθμοῦ τεῖχος εὐθὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀποτειχίσαντες ἐφρούρουν ·
Immediately after, the Athenians built fortifications at the isthmus and manned them.

1.64.1
381
τὸ δ’ ἐς τὴν Παλλήνην ἀτείχιστον ἦν ·
The side towards Pallene, however, remained unfortified.

1.64.1
382
οὐ γὰρ ἱκανοὶ ἐνόμιζον εἶναι ἔν τε τῷ ἰσθμῷ φρουρεῖν καὶ ἐς τὴν Παλλήνην διαβάντες τειχίζειν , δεδιότες μὴ σφίσιν οἱ Ποτειδεᾶται καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι γενομένοις δίχα ἐπίθωνται .
They did not consider themselves strong enough to both guard the isthmus and build fortifications across Pallene, fearing a divided attack from the Potidaeans and their allies.

1.64.2
383
καὶ πυνθανόμενοι οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει Ἀθηναῖοι τὴν Παλλήνην ἀτείχιστον οὖσαν , χρόνῳ ὕστερον πέμπουσιν ἑξακοσίους καὶ χιλίους ὁπλίτας ἑαυτῶν καὶ Φορμίωνα τὸν Ἀσωπίου στρατηγόν ·
When the Athenians in the city learned that Pallene was unfortified, they later sent sixteen hundred of their own hoplites and Phormio, the son of Asopius, as general.

1.64.2
384
ὃς ἀφικόμενος ἐς τὴν Παλλήνην καὶ ἐξ Ἀφύτιος ὁρμώμενος προσήγαγε τῇ Ποτειδαίᾳ τὸν στρατὸν κατὰ βραχὺ προϊὼν καὶ κείρων ἅμα τὴν γῆν , ὡς δὲ οὐδεὶς ἐπεξῄει ἐς μάχην , ἀπετείχισε τὸ ἐκ τῆς Παλλήνης τεῖχος .
who reached Pallene, and setting out from Aphytis, led his army to Potidaea, advancing by short marches, and ravaging the country at the same time: and when no one came out to offer him battle, he threw up works against the wall on the side of Pallene.

1.64.3
385
καὶ οὕτως ἤδη κατὰ κράτος ἡ Ποτείδαια ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐπολιορκεῖτο καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ναυσὶν ἅμα ἐφορμούσαις .
And thus Potidaea was now besieged with all their power, on both sides, and from the sea at the same time by ships that were blockading it.

1.65.1
386
Ἀριστεὺς δὲ ἀποτειχισθείσης αὐτῆς καὶ ἐλπίδα οὐδεμίαν ἔχων σωτηρίας, ἢν μή τι ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου ἢ ἄλλο παρὰ λόγον γίγνηται, ξυνεβούλευε μὲν πλὴν πεντακοσίων ἄνεμον τηρήσασι τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐκπλεῦσαι, ὅπως ἐπὶ πλέον ὁ σῖτος ἀντίσχῃ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἤθελε τῶν μενόντων εἶναι ·
Now Aristeus, when it was surrounded with works, and he had no hope of its escape, unless some movement from the Peloponnese, or something else beyond their calculation, should occur, advised all, except five hundred, to watch for a wind and sail out of it, that their provisions might hold out the longer; and he was willing himself to be one of those who remained.

1.65.1
387
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἔπειθε, βουλόμενος τὰ ἐπὶ τούτοις παρασκευάζειν καὶ ὅπως τὰ ἔξωθεν ἕξει ὡς ἄριστα, ἔκπλουν ποιεῖται λαθὼν τὴν φυλακὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων.
But when he did not persuade them, from a wish to provide what was the next best thing to be done, and in order that affairs out of the place might proceed in the best way possible, he sailed out, without being observed by the guard-ships of the Athenians.

1.65.2
388
καὶ παραμένων ἐν Χαλκιδεῦσι τά τε ἄλλα ξυνεπολέμει καὶ Σερμυλιῶν λοχήσας πρὸς τῇ πόλει πολλοὺς διέφθειρεν, ἔς τε τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἔπρασσεν ὅπῃ ὠφελία τις γενήσεται.
And remaining amongst the Chalcidians, he joined in the other measures of the war; and laid an ambuscade near the city of the Sermylians, and cut off many of them; and sending to the Peloponnese, [*] endeavoured to contrive a way in which some assistance might be brought.

1.65.2
389
μετὰ δὲ τῆς Ποτειδαία

1.66.1
390
τοῖς δ’ Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Πελοποννησίοις αἰτίαι μὲν αὗται προυγεγένηντο ἐς ἀλλήλους, τοῖς μὲν Κορινθίοις ὅτι τὴν Ποτείδαιαν ἑαυτῶν οὖσαν ἀποικίαν καὶ ἄνδρας Κορινθίων τε καὶ Πελοποννησίων ἐν αὐτῇ ὄντας ἐπολιόρκουν, τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις ἐς τοὺς Πελοποννησίους ὅτι ἑαυτῶν τε πόλιν ξυμμαχίδα καὶ φόρου ὑποτελῆ ἀπέστησαν, καὶ ἐλθόντες σφίσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ προφανοῦς ἐμάχοντο μετὰ Ποτειδεατῶν.
The Athenians then and Peloponnesians had had these previous grounds of complaint against each other; the Corinthians, because Potidaea, which was a colony of their own, and men of Corinth and from the Peloponnese in it, were being besieged; the Athenians against the Peloponnesians, because they had caused the revolt of a city which was their ally and tributary, and had come and openly fought with them in conjunction with the Potidaeans.

1.66.1
391
οὐ μέντοι ὅ γε πόλεμός πω ξυνερρώγει, ἀλλ’ ἔτι ἀνοκωχὴ ἦν ·
The war however had not yet positively broken out, but at present there was a suspension of hostilities;

1.66.1
392
ἰδίᾳ γὰρ ταῦτα οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἔπραξαν.
for the Corinthians had done these things on their own responsibility alone.

1.67.1
393
πολιορκουμένης δὲ τῆς Ποτειδαίας οὐχ ἡσύχαζον, ἀνδρῶν τε σφίσιν ἐνόντων καὶ ἅμα περὶ τῷ χωρίῳ δεδιότες ·
When, however, Potidaea was being besieged, they did not remain quiet, as they had men in it, and were alarmed for the place.

1.67.1
394
παρεκάλουν τε εὐθὺς ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα τοὺς ξυμμάχους καὶ κατεβόων ἐλθόντες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὅτι σπονδάς τε λελυκότες εἶεν καὶ ἀδικοῖεν τὴν Πελοπόννησον .
And immediately they summoned the allies to Lacedaemon, and came and cried out against the Athenians, as having broken the treaty, and as injuring the Peloponnese.

1.67.2
395
Αἰγινῆταί τε φανερῶς μὲν οὐ πρεσβευόμενοι, δεδιότες τοὺς Ἀθηναίους, κρύφα δὲ οὐχ ἥκιστα μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐνῆγον τὸν πόλεμον, λέγοντες οὐκ εἶναι αὐτόνομοι κατὰ τὰς σπονδάς.
And the Aeginetans, though they did not openly send ambassadors, for fear of the Athenians, yet in secret most of all urged on the war in conjunction with them, saying that they were not independent according to the treaty.

1.67.3
396
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι προσπαρακαλέσαντες τῶν ξυμμάχων τε καὶ εἴ τίς τι ἄλλο ἔφη ἠδικῆσθαι ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων, ξύλλογον σφῶν αὐτῶν ποιήσαντες τὸν εἰωθότα λέγειν ἐκέλευον.
So the Lacedaemonians, after summoning any one of the allies besides, who said that in any other respect he had been injured by the Athenians, held their ordinary assembly, and told them to speak.

1.67.4
397
καὶ ἄλλοι τε παριόντες ἐγκλήματα ἐποιοῦντο ὡς ἕκαστοι καὶ Μεγαρῆς, δηλοῦντες μὲν καὶ ἕτερα οὐκ ὀλίγα διάφορα, μάλιστα δὲ λιμένων τε εἴργεσθαι τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀθηναίων ἀρχῇ καὶ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀγορᾶς παρὰ τὰς σπονδάς.
And others came forward and severally made their complaints, and especially the Megareans, who urged no few other grounds of quarrel, but most of all their being excluded from the ports in the Athenian dominions, and from the Attic market, contrary to the treaty.

1.67.5
398
παρελθόντες δὲ τελευταῖοι Κορίνθιοι καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἐάσαντες πρῶτον παροξῦναι τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἐπεῖπον τοιάδε.
And the Corinthians came forward last, after permitting the others first to exasperate the Lacedaemonians; and they spoke after them as follows.

1.68.1
399
"τὸ πιστὸν ὑμᾶς, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, τῆς καθ’ ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς πολιτείας καὶ ὁμιλίας ἀπιστοτέρους ἐς τοὺς ἄλλους ἤν τι λέγωμεν καθίστησιν.
"The trustiness of your policy and intercourse amongst yourselves, Lacedaemonians, renders you the more distrustful with regard to others, if we say any thing [against them];

1.68.1
400
καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ σωφροσύνην μὲν ἔχετε, ἀμαθίᾳ δὲ πλέονι πρὸς τὰ ἔξω πράγματα χρῆσθε.
and from this you have a character for sober-mindedness, but betray too great ignorance with regard to foreign affairs.

1.68.2
401
πολλάκις γὰρ προαγορευόντων ἡμῶν ἃ ἐμέλλομεν ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων βλάπτεσθαι, οὐ περὶ ὧν ἐδιδάσκομεν ἑκάστοτε τὴν μάθησιν ἐποιεῖσθε, ἀλλὰ τῶν λεγόντων μᾶλλον ὑπενοεῖτε ὡς ἕνεκα τῶν αὑτοῖς ἰδίᾳ διαφόρων λέγουσιν.
For though we often forewarned you what injuries we were going to receive from the Athenians, you did not gain information respecting what we told you from time to time, but rather suspected the speakers of speaking for their own private interests.

1.68.2
402
καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ οὐ πρὶν πάσχειν, ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ ἐσμέν, τοὺς ξυμμάχους τούσδε παρεκαλέσατε, ἐν οἷς προσήκει ἡμᾶς οὐχ ἥκιστα εἰπεῖν, ὅσῳ καὶ μέγιστα ἐγκλήματα ἔχομεν ὑπὸ μὲν Ἀθηναίων ὑβριζόμενοι, ὑπὸ δὲ ὑμῶν ἀμελούμενοι.
And for this reason it was not before we suffered, but when we are in the very act of suffering, that you have summoned the allies here; amongst whom we may speak with the greatest propriety, inasmuch as we have also the greatest complaints to make, being insulted by the Athenians, and neglected by you.

1.68.3
403
καὶ εἰ μὲν ἀφανεῖς που ὄντες ἠδίκουν τὴν Ἑλλάδα, διδασκαλίας ἂν ὡς οὐκ εἰδόσι προσέδει.
And if they were an obscure people any where who were injuring Greece, you might have required additional warning, as not being acquainted with them;

1.68.3
404
νῦν δὲ τί δεῖ μακρηγορεῖν, ὧν τοὺς μὲν δεδουλωμένους ὁρᾶτε, τοῖς δὲ ἐπιβουλεύοντας αὐτούς, καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα τοῖς ἡμετέροις ξυμμάχοις, καὶ ἐκ πολλοῦ προπαρεσκευασμένους, εἴ ποτε ἄρα πολεμήσονται;
but as it is, why need we speak at any great length, when you see that some of us are already enslaved, and that they are plotting against others, and especially against our allies, and have been for a long time prepared beforehand, in case they should ever go to war.

1.68.4
405
ο

1.69.1
406
καὶ τῶνδε ὑμεῖς αἴτιοι, τό τε πρῶτον ἐάσαντες αὐτοὺς τὴν πόλιν μετὰ τὰ Μηδικὰ κρατῦναι καὶ ὕστερον τὰ μακρὰ στῆσαι τείχη, ἐς τόδε τε αἰεὶ ἀποστεροῦντες οὐ μόνον τοὺς ὑπ’ ἐκείνων δεδουλωμένους ἐλευθερίας, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ὑμετέρους ἤδη ξυμμάχους.
"And for these things it is you who are to blame, by having at first permitted them to fortify their city after the Median war, and subsequently to build the long walls; and by continually up to the present time depriving of liberty, not only those who had been enslaved by them, but your own allies also now.

1.69.1
407
οὐ γὰρ ὁ δουλωσάμενος, ἀλλ’ ὁ δυνάμενος μὲν παῦσαι περιορῶν δὲ ἀληθέστερον αὐτὸ δρᾷ, εἴπερ καὶ τὴν ἀξίωσιν τῆς ἀρετῆς ὡς ἐλευθερῶν τὴν Ἑλλάδα φέρεται.
For it is not he who has enslaved them, but he who has the power to stop it, but overlooks it, that more truly does this; especially if he enjoys the reputation for virtue as being the liberator of Greece.

1.69.2
408
μόλις δὲ νῦν γε ξυνήλθομεν καὶ οὐδὲ νῦν ἐπὶ φανεροῖς.
But with difficulty have we assembled now, and not even now for any clearly defined object.

1.69.2
409
χρῆν γὰρ οὐκ εἰ ἀδικούμεθα ἔτι σκοπεῖν, ἀλλὰ καθ’ ὅτι ἀμυνούμεθα.
For we ought to be considering no longer whether we are injured, but in what way we shall defend ourselves.

1.69.2
410
οἱ γὰρ δρῶντες βεβουλευμένοι πρὸς οὐ διεγνωκότας ἤδη καὶ οὐ μέλλοντες ἐπέρχονται .
For the aggressors come with their plans already formed against us who have not made up our minds; at once, and not putting it off.

1.69.3
411
καὶ ἐπιστάμεθα οἵᾳ ὁδῷ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ ὅτι κατ’ ὀλίγον χωροῦσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς πέλας.
And we know in what way, and how gradually, the Athenians encroach upon their neighbours.

1.69.3
412
καὶ λανθάνειν μὲν οἰόμενοι διὰ τὸ ἀναίσθητον ὑμῶν ἧσσον θαρσοῦσι, γνόντες δὲ εἰδότας περιορᾶν ἰσχυρῶς ἐγκείσονται.
And while they think that they are not observed through your want of perception, they feel less confident; but when they know that you are aware of their designs, but overlook them, they will press on you with all their power.

1.69.4
413
ἡσυχάζετε γάρ, μόνοι Ἑλλήνων, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, οὐ τῇ δυνάμει τινά, ἀλλὰ τῇ μελλήσει ἀμυνόμενοι, καὶ μόνοι οὐκ ἀρχομένην τὴν αὔξησιν τῶν ἐχθρῶν διπλασιουμένην δὲ καταλύοντες.
For you alone of the Greeks, Lacedaemonians, remain quiet, defending yourselves against any one, not by exertion of your power, but by mere demonstration of it; and you alone put down the power of your enemies, not when beginning, but when growing twice as great as it was.

1.69.5
414
καίτοι ἐλέγεσθε ἀσφαλεῖς εἶναι, ὧν ἄρα ὁ λόγος τοῦ ἔργου ἐκράτει.
And yet you used to have the name of cautious; but in your case the name, it seems, was more than the reality.

1.69.5
415
τόν τε γὰρ Μῆδον αὐτοὶ ἴσμεν ἐκ περάτων γῆς πρότερον ἐπὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἐλθόντα ἢ τὰ παρ’ ὑμῶν ἀξίως προαπαντῆσαι, καὶ νῦν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οὐχ ἑκάς, ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνον, ἀλλ’ ἐγγὺς ὄντας περιορᾶτε, καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐπελθεῖν αὐτοὶ ἀμύνεσθαι βούλεσθε μᾶλλον ἐπιόντας, καὶ ἐς τύχας πρὸς πολλῷ δυνατωτέρους ἀγωνιζόμενοι καταστῆναι, ἐπιστάμενοι καὶ τὸν βάρβαρον αὐτὸν περὶ αὑτῷ τὰ πλείω σφαλέντα, καὶ πρὸς αὐτοὺς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους πολλὰ ἡμᾶς ἤδη τοῖς ἁμαρτήμασιν αὐτῶν μᾶλλον ἢ τῇ ἀφ’ ὑμῶν τιμωρίᾳ περιγεγενημένους, ἐπεὶ αἵ γε ὑμέτεραι ἐλπίδες ἤδη τινάς που καὶ ἀπαρασκεύους διὰ τὸ πιστεῦσαι ἔφθειραν.
For we ourselves know that the Mede came from the ends of the earth to the Peloponnese before your forces went out to meet him as they should have done; and now the Athenians, who are not far removed, as he was, but close at hand, you overlook; and instead of attacking them, prefer to defend yourselves against their attack, and to reduce yourselves to mere chances in struggling with them when in a much more powerful condition: though you know that even the barbarian was chiefly wrecked upon himself; and that with regard to these very Athenians, we have often ere this escaped more by their errors than by assistance from you. For indeed hopes of you have before now in some instances even ruined some, while unprepared through trusting you.

1.69.6
416
καὶ μηδεὶς ὑμῶν ἐπ’ ἔχθρᾳ τὸ πλέον ἢ αἰτίᾳ νομίσῃ τάδε λέγεσθαι.
And let none of you think that this is spoken for enmity, rather than for expostulation; for expostulation is due to friends who are in error, but accusation to enemies who have committed injustice.

1.69.6
417
αἰτία μὲν γὰρ φίλων ἀνδρῶν ἐστὶν ἁμαρτανόντων, κατηγορία δὲ ἐχθρῶν ἀδικησάντων.
For expostulation is due to friends who have erred, and accusation to enemies who have done wrong.

1.70.1
418
"καὶ ἅμα, εἴπερ τινὲς καὶ ἄλλοι, ἄξιοι νομίζομεν εἶναι τοῖς πέλας ψόγον ἐπενεγκεῖν, ἄλλως τε καὶ μεγάλων τῶν διαφερόντων καθεστώτων, περὶ ὧν οὐκ αἰσθάνεσθαι ἡμῖν γε δοκεῖτε, οὐδ’ ἐκλογίσασθαι πώποτε πρὸς οἵους ὑμῖν Ἀθηναίους ὄντας καὶ ὅσον ὑμῶν καὶ ὡς πᾶν διαφέροντας ὁ ἀγὼν ἔσται.
"At the same time we consider that we, if any, have a right to administer rebuke to our neighbours; especially as the differences [between you and them] are great; of which you do not seem to us to have any perception, nor to have ever yet considered with what kind of people you will have to struggle in the Athenians, and how very, nay, how entirely different from yourselves.

1.70.2
419
οἱ μέν γε νεωτεροποιοὶ καὶ ἐπινοῆσαι ὀξεῖς καὶ ἐπιτελέσαι ἔργῳ ἃ ἂν γνῶσιν.
They, for instance, are innovating, and quick to plan and accomplish by action what they have designed;

1.70.2
420
ὑμεῖς δὲ τὰ ὑπάρχοντά τε σῴζειν καὶ ἐπιγνῶναι μηδὲν καὶ ἔργῳ οὐδὲ τἀναγκαῖα ἐξικέσθαι.
while you are disposed to keep what you have, and form no new design, and by action not even to carry out what is necessary.

1.70.3
421
αὖθις δὲ οἱ μὲν καὶ παρὰ δύναμιν τολμηταὶ καὶ παρὰ γνώμην κινδυνευταὶ καὶ ἐν τοῖς δεινοῖς εὐέλπιδες.
Again, they are bold even beyond their power, and adventurous beyond their judgment, and sanguine in dangers;

1.70.3
422
τὸ δὲ ὑμέτερον τῆς τε δυνάμεως ἐνδεᾶ πρᾶξαι τῆς τε γνώμης μηδὲ τοῖς βεβαίοις πιστεῦσαι τῶν τε δεινῶν μηδέποτε οἴεσθαι ἀπολυθήσεσθαι.
while your character is to undertake things beneath your power, and not to trust even the sure grounds of your judgement, and to think that you will never escape from your dangers.

1.70.4
423
καὶ μὴν καὶ ἄοκνοι πρὸς ὑμᾶς μελλητὰς καὶ ἀποδημηταὶ πρὸς ἐνδημοτάτους.
Moreover, they are unhesitating, in opposition to you who are dilatory;

1.70.4
424
οἴονται γὰρ οἱ μὲν τῇ ἀπουσίᾳ ἄν τι κτᾶσθαι, ὑμεῖς δὲ τῷ ἐπελθεῖν καὶ τὰ ἑτοῖμα ἂν βλάψαι.
and fond of going from home, in opposition to you who are most fond of staying at home: for they think that by their absence they may acquire something; whereas you think that by attempting [more] you would do harm to what you have.

1.70.5
425
κρατοῦντές τε τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐξέρχονται καὶ νικώμενοι ἐπ’ ἐλάχιστον ἀναπίπτουσιν.
When they conquer their enemies, they carry out their advantage to the utmost; and when conquered, they fall back the least.

1.70.6
426
ἔτι δὲ τοῖς μὲν σώμασιν ἀλλοτριωτάτοις ὑπ

1.70.7
427
καὶ ἃ μὲν ἂν ἐπινοήσαντες μὴ ἐπεξέλθωσιν, οἰκείων στέρεσθαι ἡγοῦνται, ἃ δ’ ἂν ἐπελθόντες κτήσωνται, ὀλίγα πρὸς τὰ μέλλοντα τυχεῖν πράξαντες.
And what they have planned but not carried out, they think that in this they lose something already their own; what they have attempted and gained, that in this they have achieved but little in comparison with what they mean to do.

1.70.7
428
ἢν δ’ ἄρα του καὶ πείρᾳ σφαλῶσιν, ἀντελπίσαντες ἄλλα ἐπλήρωσαν τὴν χρείαν.
Then, if they fail in an attempt at anything, by forming fresh hopes in its stead, they supply the deficiency;

1.70.7
429
μόνοι γὰρ ἔχουσί τε ὁμοίως καὶ ἐλπίζουσιν ἃ ἂν ἐπινοήσωσι διὰ τὸ ταχεῖαν τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν ποιεῖσθαι ὧν ἂν γνῶσιν.
for they are the only people that succeed to the full extent of their hope in what they have planned, because they quickly undertake what they have resolved.

1.70.8
430
καὶ ταῦτα μετὰ πόνων πάντα καὶ κινδύνων δι’ ὅλου τοῦ αἰῶνος μοχθοῦσι, καὶ ἀπολαύουσιν ἐλάχιστα τῶν ὑπαρχόντων διὰ τὸ αἰεὶ κτᾶσθαι καὶ μήτε ἑορτὴν ἄλλο τι ἡγεῖσθαι ἢ τὸ τὰ δέοντα πρᾶξαι, ξυμφοράν τε οὐχ ἧσσον ἡσυχίαν ἀπράγμονα ἢ ἀσχολίαν ἐπίπονον.
And in this way they labour, with toils and dangers, all their life long; and least enjoy what they have, because they are always getting, and think a feast to be nothing else but to gain their ends, and inactive quiet to be no less a calamity than laborious occupation.

1.70.9
431
ὥστε εἴ τις αὐτοὺς ξυνελὼν φαίη πεφυκέναι ἐπὶ τῷ μήτε αὐτοὺς ἔχειν ἡσυχίαν μήτε τοὺς ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους ἐᾶν.
So that if any one should sum up their character, by saying, that they are made neither to be quiet themselves, nor let the rest of the world be so, he would speak correctly.

1.71.1
432
ταύτης μέντοι τοιαύτης ἀντικαθεστηκυίας πόλεως, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, διαμέλλετε καὶ οἴεσθε τὴν ἡσυχίαν οὐ τούτοις τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἀρκεῖν οἳ ἂν τῇ μὲν παρασκευῇ δίκαια πράσσωσι, τῇ δὲ γνώμῃ, ἢν ἀδικῶνται, δῆλοι ὦσι μὴ ἐπιτρέψοντες, ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τῷ μὴ λυπεῖν τε τοὺς ἄλλους καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀμυνόμενοι μὴ βλάπτεσθαι τὸ ἴσον νέμετε.
And yet when such is the character of this state that is opposed to you, Lacedaemonians, you go on delaying, and think that peace is not most lasting in the case of those men, who with their resources do what is right, while as regards their feelings, they are known to be determined not to put up with it, if they are injured: but you practise fair dealing on the principle of neither annoying others, nor being hurt yourselves in self-defence.

1.71.2
433
μόλις δ’ ἂν πόλει ὁμοίᾳ παροικοῦντες ἐτυγχάνετε τούτου.
Scarcely, however, could you have succeeded in this, though you had lived by a state of congenial views:

1.71.2
434
νῦν δ’ , ὅπερ καὶ ἄρτι ἐδηλώσαμεν , ἀρχαιότροπα ὑμῶν τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα πρὸς αὐτούς ἐστιν .
while as it is, your ways, as we just now showed you, are old-fashioned compared with them.

1.71.3
435
ἀνάγκη δὲ ὥσπερ τέχνης αἰεὶ τὰ ἐπιγιγνόμενα κρατεῖν·
But, as in the case of art, improvements must ever prevail;

1.71.3
436
καὶ ἡσυχαζούσῃ μὲν πόλει τὰ ἀκίνητα νόμιμα ἄριστα, πρὸς πολλὰ δὲ ἀναγκαζομένοις ἰέναι πολλῆς καὶ τῆς ἐπιτεχνήσεως δεῖ.
and though for a state that enjoys quiet, unchanged institutions are best, yet for those who are compelled to apply to many things, much skill and innovation are also necessary.

1.71.3
437
δι’ ὅπερ καὶ τὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπὸ τῆς πολυπειρίας ἐπὶ πλέον ὑμῶν κεκαίνωται.
And for this reason the institutions of the Athenians, from their great experience, have been remodeled to a greater extent than yours.

1.71.4
438
μέχρι μὲν οὖν τοῦδε ὡρίσθω ὑμῶν ἡ βραδυτής·
At this point then let your dilatoriness cease;

1.71.4
439
νῦν δὲ τοῖς τε ἄλλοις καὶ Ποτειδεάταις, ὥσπερ ὑπεδέξασθε, βοηθήσατε κατὰ τάχος ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν, ἵνα μὴ ἄνδρας τε φίλους καὶ ξυγγενεῖς τοῖς ἐχθίστοις προῆσθε καὶ ἡμᾶς τοὺς ἄλλους ἀθυμίᾳ πρὸς ἑτέραν τινὰ ξυμμαχίαν τρέψητε.
and now assist us, and especially the Potidaeans, as you undertook, by making with all speed an incursion into Attica, so that you may not abandon men who are your friends and kinsmen to their bitterest enemies, and turn the rest of us in despair to some other alliance.

1.71.5
440
δρῷμεν δ’ ἂν ἄδικον οὐδὲν οὔτε πρὸς θεῶν τῶν ὁρκίων οὔτε πρὸς ἀνθρώπων τῶν αἰσθανομένων·
In doing so, we would commit no injustice, neither in the sight of the gods who received our oaths nor in that of men who are witnesses;

1.71.5
441
λύουσι γὰρ σπονδὰς οὐχ οἱ δι’ ἐρημίαν ἄλλοις προσιόντες, ἀλλ’ οἱ μὴ βοηθοῦντες οἷς ἂν ξυνομόσωσιν.
for treaties are not broken by those who, out of necessity, turn to others for help, but by those who do not aid those with whom they have sworn allegiance.

1.71.6
442
βουλομένων δὲ ὑμῶν προθύμων εἶναι μενοῦμεν·
If you are willing to be enthusiastic in your support, we will remain committed;

1.71.6
443
οὔτε γὰρ ὅσια ἂν ποιοῖμεν μεταβαλλόμενοι οὔτε ξυνηθεστέρους ἂν ἄλλους εὕροιμεν.
for neither would it be right for us to change sides, nor would we find others more accustomed to our ways.

1.71.7
444
πρὸς τάδε βουλεύεσθε εὖ καὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον πειρᾶσθε μὴ ἐλάσσω ἐξηγεῖσθαι ἢ οἱ πατέρες ὑμῖν παρέδοσαν.
Therefore, consider these things carefully and strive to maintain a dominant position in the Peloponnese, no less than what your fathers bequeathed to you.

1.72.1
445
τοιαῦτα μὲν οἱ Κορίνθιοι εἶπον.
Such were the words spoken by the Corinthians.

1.72.1
446
τῶν δὲ Ἀθηναίων ἔτυχε γὰρ πρεσβεία πρότερον ἐν τῇ Λακεδαίμονι περὶ ἄλλων παροῦσα, καὶ ὡς ᾔσθοντο τῶν λόγων, ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς παριτητέα ἐς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους εἶναι, τῶν μὲν ἐγκλημάτων πέρι μηδὲν ἀπολογησομένους ὧν αἱ πόλεις ἐνεκάλουν, δηλῶσαι δὲ περὶ τοῦ παντὸς ὡς οὐ ταχέως αὐτοῖς βουλευτέον εἴη, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλέονι σκεπτέον.
The Athenians, who already had an embassy present in Lacedaemon for other reasons, upon hearing these words, thought it necessary to approach the Lacedaemonians. They decided not to defend against the accusations of the cities, but to demonstrate that the Lacedaemonians should not rush into judgment, but rather consider the matter more thoroughly.

1.72.1
447
καὶ ἅμα τὴν σφετέραν πόλιν ἐβούλοντο σημῆναι ὅση εἴη δύναμιν, καὶ ὑπόμνησιν ποιήσασθαι τοῖς τε πρεσβυτέροις ὧν ᾔδεσαν καὶ τοῖς νεωτέροις ἐξήγησιν ὧν ἄπειροι ἦσαν, νομίζοντες μᾶλλον ἂν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν λόγων πρὸς τὸ ἡσυχάζειν τραπέσθαι ἢ πρὸς τὸ πολεμεῖν.
Furthermore, they wanted to demonstrate the strength of their city, to remind the older members of what they already knew, and to explain to the younger ones what they were unfamiliar with, believing that this would encourage the Lacedaemonians to lean towards peace rather than war.

1.72.2
448
προσελθόντες οὖν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἔφασαν βούλεσθαι καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐς τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν εἰπεῖν, εἴ τι μὴ ἀποκωλύοι.
So they approached the Lacedaemonians and expressed their wish to also address the assembly, if there were no objections.

1.72.2
449
οἱ δὲ ἐκέλευόν τε παριέναι, καὶ παρελθόντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔ

1.73.1
450
ἡ μὲν πρέσβευσις ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐς ἀντιλογίαν τοῖς ὑμετέροις ξυμμάχοις ἐγένετο, ἀλλὰ περὶ ὧν ἡ πόλις ἔπεμψεν.
"Our embassy was not intended for a dispute with your allies, but on the matter for which our city sent us.

1.73.1
451
αἰσθανόμενοι δὲ καταβοὴν οὐκ ὀλίγην οὖσαν ἡμῶν παρήλθομεν οὐ τοῖς ἐγκλήμασι τῶν πόλεων ἀντεροῦντες, ἀλλ’ ὅπως μὴ ῥᾳδίως περὶ μεγάλων πραγμάτων τοῖς ξυμμάχοις πειθόμενοι χεῖρον βουλεύσησθε.
Being aware of the significant outcry against us, we have come not to refute the cities' accusations, but to ensure you do not hastily make poor decisions on important matters based on your allies' persuasions.

1.73.2
452
καὶ τὰ μὲν πάνυ παλαιὰ τί δεῖ λέγειν, ὧν ἀκοαὶ μᾶλλον λόγων μάρτυρες ἢ ὄψις τῶν ἀκουσομένων?
And why should we speak of very ancient matters, which are more attested by hearsay than by the sight of those who will hear us?

1.73.2
453
τὰ δὲ Μηδικὰ καὶ ὅσα αὐτοὶ ξύνιστε, εἰ καὶ δι’ ὄχλου μᾶλλον ἔσται αἰεὶ προβαλλομένοις, ἀνάγκη λέγειν.
But we must speak of the Median wars and what you yourselves know, even though it may be tiring to always bring them forward.

1.73.2
454
καὶ γὰρ ὅτε ἐδρῶμεν, ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ ἐκινδυνεύετο, ἧς τοῦ μὲν ἔργου μέρος μετέσχετε, τοῦ δὲ λόγου μὴ παντός, εἴ τι ὠφελεῖ, στερισκώμεθα.
For when we stood firm, it was for a benefit in which you had a share in the action but not in the entire recognition, if it benefits us in any way, let us not be deprived of it.

1.73.3
455
ῥηθήσεται δὲ οὐ παραιτήσεως μᾶλλον ἕνεκα ἢ μαρτυρίου καὶ δηλώσεως πρὸς οἵαν ὑμῖν πόλιν μὴ εὖ βουλευομένοις ὁ ἀγὼν καταστήσεται .
Our words, however, will be spoken, not so much for the purpose of exculpation, as of testimony, and of showing with what kind of a state you will have to contend, if you do not take good counsel.

1.73.4
456
φαμὲν γὰρ Μαραθῶνί τε μόνοι προκινδυνεῦσαι τῷ βαρβάρῳ καὶ ὅτε τὸ ὕστερον ἦλθεν, οὐχ ἱκανοὶ ὄντες κατὰ γῆν ἀμύνεσθαι, ἐσβάντες ἐς τὰς ναῦς πανδημεὶ ἐν Σαλαμῖνι ξυνναυμαχῆσαι, ὅπερ ἔσχε μὴ κατὰ πόλεις αὐτὸν ἐπιπλέοντα τὴν Πελοπόννησον πορθεῖν, ἀδυνάτων ἂν ὄντων πρὸς ναῦς πολλὰς ἀλλήλοις ἐπιβοηθεῖν.
We claim that at Marathon we alone dared to face the barbarian, and when he came again, unable to defend ourselves by land, we embarked on our ships to join the naval battle at Salamis. This action prevented him from sailing against and devastating the Peloponnese, city by city, when you would have been unable to aid each other against his numerous ships.

1.73.5
457
τεκμήριον δὲ μέγιστον αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν·
The greatest proof of this was provided by the enemy himself;

1.73.5
458
νικηθεὶς γὰρ ταῖς ναυσὶν ὡς οὐκέτι αὐτῷ ὁμοίας οὔσης τῆς δυνάμεως κατὰ τάχος τῷ πλέονι τοῦ στρατοῦ ἀνεχώρησεν.
for after being defeated at sea, realizing his power was no longer equal, he quickly retreated with the majority of his army.

1.74.1
459
τοιούτου μέντοι τούτου ξυμβάντος, καὶ σαφῶς δηλωθέντος ὅτι ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων τὰ πράγματα ἐγένετο, τρία τὰ ὠφελιμώτατα ἐς αὐτὸ παρεσχόμεθα, ἀριθμόν τε νεῶν πλεῖστον καὶ ἄνδρα στρατηγὸν ξυνετώτατον καὶ προθυμίαν ἀοκνοτάτην·
In light of this event, clearly demonstrating that the fate of the Greeks was decided at sea, we contributed the three most beneficial elements: the largest number of ships, the most astute general, and the most unwavering zeal.

1.74.1
460
ναῦς μέν γε ἐς τὰς τετρακοσίας ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους τῶν δύο μοιρῶν, Θεμιστοκλέα δὲ ἄρχον

1.74.2
461
προθυμίαν δὲ καὶ πολὺ τολμηροτάτην ἐδείξαμεν, οἵ γε, ἐπειδὴ ἡμῖν κατὰ γῆν οὐδεὶς ἐβοήθει, τῶν ἄλλων ἤδη μέχρι ἡμῶν δουλευόντων ἠξιώσαμεν ἐκλιπόντες τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὰ οἰκεῖα διαφθείραντες μηδ’ ὣς τὸ τῶν περιλοίπων ξυμμάχων κοινὸν προλιπεῖν μηδὲ σκεδασθέντες ἀχρεῖοι αὐτοῖς γενέσθαι, ἀλλ’ ἐσβάντες ἐς τὰς ναῦς κινδυνεῦσαι καὶ μὴ ὀργισθῆναι ὅτι ἡμῖν οὐ προυτιμωρήσατε.
Our zeal and daring were unmatched. When no one aided us on land and others were already enslaved, we chose not to abandon our allies or become useless by scattering. Instead, we embarked on our ships to face danger, and did not resent that you did not come to our aid earlier.

1.74.3
462
ὥστε φαμὲν οὐχ ἧσσον αὐτοὶ ὠφελῆσαι ὑμᾶς ἢ τυχεῖν τούτου.
Thus, we claim that we have helped you no less than we ourselves have benefited.

1.74.3
463
ὑμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ἀπό τε οἰκουμένων τῶν πόλεων καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ τὸ λοιπὸν νέμεσθαι , ἐπειδὴ ἐδείσατε ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν καὶ οὐχ ἡμῶν τὸ πλέον , ἐβοηθήσατε ( ὅτε γοῦν ἦμεν ἔτι σῶοι , οὐ παρεγένεσθε ) ·
For you, setting out from cities that were inhabited, and with a view to enjoying them in future, came to our assistance, [only] after you were afraid for yourselves, and not so much for us; (at any rate, when we were still in safety, you did not come to us;)

1.74.3
464
ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀπό τε τῆς οὐκ οὔσης ἔτι ὁρμώμενοι καὶ ὑπὲρ τῆς ἐν βραχείᾳ ἐλπίδι οὔσης κινδυνεύοντες ξυνεσώσαμεν ὑμᾶς τε τὸ μέρος καὶ ἡμᾶς αὐτούς .
but we, setting out from a country which was no more, and running the risk for what existed only in scanty hope, bore our full share in the deliverance both of you and of ourselves.

1.74.4
465
εἰ δὲ προσεχωρήσαμεν πρότερον τῷ Μήδῳ δείσαντες, ὥσπερ καὶ ἄλλοι, περὶ τῇ χώρᾳ, ἢ μὴ ἐτολμήσαμεν ὕστερον ἐσβῆναι ἐς τὰς ναῦς ὡς διεφθαρμένοι, οὐδὲν ἂν ἔδει ἔτι ὑμᾶς μὴ ἔχοντας ναῦς ἱκανὰς ναυμαχεῖν, ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν ἂν αὐτῷ προυχώρησε τὰ πράγματα ᾗ ἐβούλετο.
But if we had before joined the Mede through fear for our country, like others, or had afterwards had no heart to go on board our ships, considering ourselves as ruined men; there would have been no longer any need of your fighting by sea without a sufficient number of ships, but things would have quietly progressed for him just as he wished.

1.75.1
466
"ἆρ’ ἄξιοί ἐσμεν, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, καὶ προθυμίας ἕνεκα τῆς τότε καὶ γνώμης ξυνέσεως ἀρχῆς γε ἧς ἔχομεν τοῖς Ἕλλησι μὴ οὕτως ἄγαν ἐπιφθόνως διακεῖσθαι;
"Do we not then deserve, Lacedaemonians, both for our zeal at that time, and the intelligence of our counsel, not to lie under such excessive odium with the Greeks, at least for the empire we possess?

1.75.2
467
καὶ γὰρ αὐτὴν τήνδε ἐλάβομεν οὐ βιασάμενοι, ἀλλ’ ὑμῶν μὲν οὐκ ἐθελησάντων παραμεῖναι πρὸς τὰ ὑπόλοιπα τοῦ βαρβάρου, ἡμῖν δὲ προσελθόντων τῶν ξυμμάχων καὶ αὐτῶν δεηθέντων ἡγεμόνας καταστῆναι.
For this very empire we gained, not by acting with violence, but through your having been unwilling to stand by them to finish the business with the barbarian, and through the allies having come to us, and of their own accord begged us to become their leaders:

1.75.3
468
ἐξ αὐτοῦ δὲ τοῦ ἔργου κατηναγκάσθημεν τὸ πρῶτον προαγαγεῖν αὐτὴν ἐς τόδε, μάλιστα μὲν ὑπὸ δέους, ἔπειτα καὶ τιμῆς, ὕστερον καὶ ὠφελίας.
and from this very fact we were compelled at first to advance it to its present height, principally from motives of fear, then of honour also, and afterwards of advantage too.

1.75.4
469
καὶ οὐκ ἀσφαλὲς ἔτι ἐδόκει εἶναι τοῖς πολλοῖς ἀπηχθημένους, καί τινων καὶ ἤδη ἀποστάντων κατεστραμμένων, ὑμῶν τε ἡμῖν οὐκέτι ὁμοίως φίλων, ἀλλ’ ὑπόπτων καὶ διαφόρων ὄντων, ἀνέντας κινδυνεύειν.
And it no longer appeared to be safe, when we were hated by the generality, and when some who had already revolted had been subdued, and you were no longer friends with us, as you had been, but suspicious of us, and at variance with us, to run the risk of giving it up; for those who revolted would have gone over to you.

1.75.4
470
καὶ γὰρ ἂν αἱ ἀποστάσεις πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐγίγνοντο.
for those who revolted would have gone over to you.

1.75.5
471
πᾶσι δὲ ἀνεπίφθονον τὰ ξυμφέροντα τῶν μεγίστων πέρι κινδύνων εὖ τίθεσθαι.
And all may without odium secure their own interests with regard to the greatest perils.

1.76.1
472
ὑμεῖς γοῦν, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, τὰς ἐν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ πόλεις ἐπὶ τὸ ὑμῖν ὠφέλιμον καταστησάμενοι ἐξηγεῖσθε.
"You, at least, Lacedaemonians, have settled to your own advantage the government of the states in the Peloponnese over which you have a supremacy;

1.76.1
473
καὶ εἰ τότε ὑπομείναντες διὰ παντὸς ἀπήχθεσθε ἐν τῇ ἡγεμονίᾳ, ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς, εὖ ἴσμεν μὴ ἂν ἧσσον ὑμᾶς λυπηροὺς γενομένους τοῖς ξυμμάχοις καὶ ἀναγκασθέντας ἂν ἢ ἄρχειν ἐγκρατῶς ἢ αὐτοὺς κινδυνεύειν.
and if at that time you had remained through the whole business, and been disliked in your command, as we were, we know full well that you would have become no less severe to the allies, and would have been compelled either to rule with a strong hand, or yourselves be exposed to danger.

1.76.2
474
οὕτως οὐδ’ ἡμεῖς θαυμαστὸν οὐδὲν πεποιήκαμεν οὐδ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρωπείου τρόπου, εἰ ἀρχήν τε διδομένην ἐδεξάμεθα καὶ ταύτην μὴ ἀνεῖμεν ὑπὸ τριῶν τῶν μεγίστων νικηθέντες, τιμῆς καὶ δέους καὶ ὠφελίας, οὐδ’ αὖ πρῶτοι τοῦ τοιούτου ὑπάρξαντες, ἀλλ’ αἰεὶ καθεστῶτος τὸν ἥσσω ὑπὸ τοῦ δυνατωτέρου κατείργεσθαι, ἄξιοί τε ἅμα νομίζοντες εἶναι καὶ ὑμῖν δοκοῦντες μέχρι οὗ τὰ ξυμφέροντα λογιζόμενοι τῷ δικαίῳ λόγῳ νῦν χρῆσθε, ὃν ο

1.76.3
475
ἐπαινεῖσθαί τε ἄξιοι οἵτινες χρησάμενοι τῇ ἀνθρωπείᾳ φύσει ὥστε ἑτέρων ἄρχειν δικαιότεροι ἢ κατὰ τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν δύναμιν γένωνται.
Nay, all are worthy of praise, who, after acting according to human nature in ruling others, have been more just than their actual power enabled them to be.

1.76.4
476
ἄλλους γ’ ἂν οὖν οἰόμεθα τὰ ἡμέτερα λαβόντας δεῖξαι ἂν μάλιστα εἴ τι μετριάζομεν.
At any rate we imagine, that if some others had possessed our means, they would have best shown whether we are at all moderate or not;

1.76.4
477
ἡμῖν δὲ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἐπιεικοῦς ἀδοξία τὸ πλέον ἢ ἔπαινος οὐκ εἰκότως περιέστη.
though to us there has unfairly resulted from our good nature disrepute rather than commendation.

1.77.1
478
καὶ ἐλασσούμενοι γὰρ ἐν ταῖς ξυμβολαίαις πρὸς τοὺς ξυμμάχους δίκαις καὶ παρ’ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ἐν τοῖς ὁμοίοις νόμοις ποιήσαντες τὰς κρίσεις φιλοδικεῖν δοκοῦμεν.
For from putting up with less than we might have had in contract-suits with the allies, and from having made our decisions in our own courts on the footing of equal laws, we are thought to be litigious.

1.77.2
479
καὶ οὐδεὶς σκοπεῖ αὐτῶν τοῖς καὶ ἄλλοθί που ἀρχὴν ἔχουσι καὶ ἧσσον ἡμῶν πρὸς τοὺς ὑπηκόους μετρίοις οὖσι διότι τοῦτο οὐκ ὀνειδίζεται.
And none of them considers why this reproach is not brought against those who have empire in any other quarter also, and are less moderate towards their subjects than we have been: for those who can act with violence have no need besides to act with justice.

1.77.2
480
βιάζεσθαι γὰρ οἷς ἂν ἐξῇ, δικάζεσθαι οὐδὲν προσδέονται.
For those who can act with violence have no need to act with justice.

1.77.3
481
οἱ δὲ εἰθισμένοι πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ὁμιλεῖν, ἤν τι παρὰ τὸ μὴ οἴεσθαι χρῆναι ἢ γνώμῃ ἢ δυνάμει τῇ διὰ τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ ὁπωσοῦν ἐλασσωθῶσιν, οὐ τοῦ πλέονος μὴ στερισκόμενοι χάριν ἔχουσιν, ἀλλὰ τοῦ ἐνδεοῦς χαλεπώτερον φέρουσιν ἢ εἰ ἀπὸ πρώτης ἀποθέμενοι τὸν νόμον φανερῶς ἐπλεονεκτοῦμεν.
But those accustomed to dealing with us on an equal footing, if they happen to be at a disadvantage in any respect, whether in judgement or in power due to our rule, do not feel grateful for not being deprived of more, but are more aggrieved by what they lose than if we had openly taken advantage of them from the beginning.

1.77.3
482
ἐκείνως δὲ οὐδ’ ἂν αὐτοὶ ἀντέλεγον ὡς οὐ χρεὼν τὸν ἥσσω τῷ κρατοῦντι ὑποχωρεῖν.
Indeed, they themselves would not dispute that it is necessary for the inferior to yield to the superior.

1.77.4
483
ἀδικούμενοί τε, ὡς ἔοικεν, οἱ ἄνθρωποι μᾶλλον ὀργίζονται ἢ βιαζόμενοι.
It seems that men are more angered when they feel wronged than when they are treated with violence.

1.77.4
484
τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου δοκεῖ πλεονεκτεῖσθαι, τὸ δ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ κρείσσονος καταναγκάζεσθαι.
For the former appears to be taking advantage unfairly, while the latter is seen as compelling due to superior power.

1.77.5
485
ὑπὸ γοῦν τοῦ Μήδου δεινότερα τούτων πάσχοντες ἠνείχοντο, ἡ δὲ ἡμετέρα ἀρχὴ χαλεπὴ δοκεῖ εἶναι, εἰκότως.
Indeed, they endured worse under the Medes, yet our rule seems harsh to them, and understandably so.

1.77.5
486
τὸ παρὸν γὰρ αἰεὶ βαρὺ τοῖς ὑπηκόοις.
For the present always seems oppressive to those who are subject to it.

1.77.6
487
ὑμεῖς γ’ ἂν οὖν εἰ καθελόντες ἡμᾶς ἄρξαιτε, τάχα ἂν τὴν εὔνοιαν ἣν διὰ τὸ ἡμέτερον δέος εἰλήφατε μεταβάλοιτε, εἴπερ οἷα καὶ τότε πρὸς τὸν Μῆδον δι’ ὀλίγου ἡγησάμενοι ὑπεδείξατε, ὁμοῖα καὶ νῦν γνώσεσθε.
You, at any rate, should you subdue us and possess an empire, would quickly lose the good-will which you have enjoyed through their fear of us; if you have the same views now as you gave symptoms of then, when you led then against the Mede for a short time.

1.77.6
488
ἄμεικτα γὰρ τά τε καθ’ ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς νόμιμα τοῖς ἄλλοις ἔχετε καὶ προσέτι εἷς ἕκαστος ἐξιὼν οὔτε τούτοις χρῆται οὔθ’ οἷς ἡ ἄλλη Ἑλλὰς νομίζει.
For you have institutions by yourselves, distinct from the rest of the world; and moreover, each individual of you, on going abroad, neither acts according to these, nor to those which the rest of Greece recognises.

1.78.1
489
βουλεύεσθε οὖν βραδέως ὡς οὐ περὶ βραχέων, καὶ μὴ ἀλλοτρίαις γνώμαις καὶ ἐγκλήμασι πεισθέντες οἰκεῖον πόνον πρόσθησθε.
Deliberate therefore slowly, as on no trifling matters; and do not, through being influenced by other people's views and accusations, bring on yourselves trouble of your own.

1.78.1
490
τοῦ δὲ πολέμου τὸν παράλογον, ὅσος ἐστί, πρὶν ἐν αὐτῷ γενέσθαι προδιάγνωτε.
But consider before on previously to your being engaged in it, how for when long protracted, it generally comes in the end to depend on chances;

1.78.2
491
μηκυνόμενος γὰρ φιλεῖ ἐς τύχας τὰ πολλὰ περιίστασθαι, ὧν ἴσον τε ἀπέχομεν καὶ ὁποτέρως ἔσται ἐν ἀδήλῳ κινδυνεύεται.
from which we are equally removed, and run the risk in uncertainty as to which way it will turn out.

1.78.3
492
ἰόντες τε οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐς τοὺς πολέμους τῶν ἔργων πρότερον ἔχονται, ἃ χρῆν ὕστερον δρᾶ

1.78.4
493
ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐν οὐδεμιᾷ πω τοιαύτῃ ἁμαρτίᾳ ὄντες οὔτ’ αὐτοὶ οὔθ’ ὑμᾶς ὁρῶντες λέγομεν ὑμῖν, ἕως ἔτι αὐθαίρετος ἀμφοτέροις ἡ εὐβουλία, σπονδὰς μὴ λύειν μηδὲ παραβαίνειν τοὺς ὅρκους, τὰ δὲ διάφορα δίκῃ λύεσθαι κατὰ τὴν ξυνθήκην.
We, however, being neither ourselves yet involved in such an error, nor seeing you in it, charge you, while good counsel is still eligible to both sides, not to break treaty nor offend against your oaths, but to let our differences be judicially settled according to agreement.

1.78.4
494
εἰ δὲ μή, θεοὺς τοὺς ὁρκίους μάρτυρας ποιούμενοι πειρασόμεθα ἀμύνεσθαι πολέμου ἄρχοντας ταύτῃ ᾗ ἂν ὑφηγῆσθε.
Else we will call to witness the gods who received our oaths, and endeavour to requite you for commencing hostilities, in such a way as you may set the example.

1.79.1
495
τοιαῦτα δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι εἶπον.
Thus spoke the Athenians.

1.79.1
496
ἐπειδὴ δὲ τῶν τε ξυμμάχων ἤκουσαν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὰ ἐγκλήματα τὰ ἐς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἃ ἔλεξαν, μεταστησάμενοι πάντας ἐβουλεύοντο κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς περὶ τῶν παρόντων.
After the Lacedaemonians had heard from the allies their charges against the Athenians, and from the Athenians what they had to say, they made them all withdraw, and consulted by themselves on the question before them.

1.79.2
497
καὶ τῶν μὲν πλεόνων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ αἱ γνῶμαι ἔφερον, ἀδικεῖν τε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἤδη καὶ πολεμητέα εἶναι ἐν τάχει· παρελθὼν δὲ Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν, ἀνὴρ καὶ ξυνετὸς δοκῶν εἶναι καὶ σώφρων, ἔλεξε τοιάδε.
And the opinions of the majority went the same way; viz. that the Athenians were already guilty of injustice, and that they ought to go to war with all speed.

1.79.2
498
καὶ τῶν μὲν πλεόνων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ αἱ γνῶμαι ἔφερον, ἀδικεῖν τε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἤδη καὶ πολεμητέα εἶναι ἐν τάχει· παρελθὼν δὲ Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν, ἀνὴρ καὶ ξυνετὸς δοκῶν εἶναι καὶ σώφρων, ἔλεξε τοιάδε.
And the opinions of the majority went the same way; viz. that the Athenians were already guilty of injustice, and that they ought to go to war with all speed. But Archidamus their king, a man who was considered both intelligent and prudent, came forward and spoke as follows.

1.80.1
499
‘καὶ αὐτὸς πολλῶν ἤδη πολέμων ἔμπειρός εἰμι, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, καὶ ὑμῶν τοὺς ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ ἡλικίᾳ ὁρῶ, ὥστε μήτε ἀπειρίᾳ ἐπιθυμῆσαί τινα τοῦ ἔργου, ὅπερ ἂν οἱ πολλοὶ πάθοιεν, μήτε ἀγαθὸν καὶ ἀσφαλὲς νομίσαντα.
"I have both myself already had experience in many wars, Lacedaemonians, and see that those of you who are of the same age [have had it also]; so that one would neither desire the business from inexperience, as might be the case with most men, nor from thinking it a good and safe one.

1.80.2
500
εὕροιτε δ’ ἂν τόνδε περὶ οὗ νῦν βουλεύεσθε οὐκ ἂν ἐλάχιστον γενόμενον, εἰ σωφρόνως τις αὐτὸν ἐκλογίζοιτο.
But this war, about which you are now consulting, you would find likely to be none of the least, if any one should soberly consider it.

1.80.3
501
πρὸς μὲν γὰρ Πελοποννησίους καὶ τοὺς ἀστυγείτονας παρόμοιος ἡμῶν ἡ ἀλκή, καὶ διὰ ταχέων οἷόν τε ἐφ’ ἕκαστα ἐλθεῖν·
For against the Peloponnesians and our neighbours our strength is of the same description, and we can quickly reach our destination in each case.

1.80.3
502
πρὸς δὲ ἄνδρας οἳ γῆν τε ἑκὰς ἔχουσι καὶ προσέτι θαλάσσης ἐμπειρότατοί εἰσι καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν ἄριστα ἐξήρτυνται, πλούτῳ τε ἰδίῳ καὶ δημοσίῳ καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ ἵπποις καὶ ὅπλοις καὶ ὄχλῳ ὅσος οὐκ ἐν ἄλλῳ ἑνί γε χωρίῳ Ἑλληνικῷ ἐστίν, ἔτι δὲ καὶ ξυμμάχους πολλοὺς φόρου ὑποτελεῖς ἔχουσι, πῶς χρὴ πρὸς τούτους ῥᾳδίως πόλεμον ἄρασθαι καὶ τίνι πιστεύσαντας ἀπαρασκεύους ἐπειχθῆναι;
But against men who have a distant land and are the most experienced in sea affairs, and are best equipped in every other way, with private and public wealth, and ships, and horses, and weapons, and a multitude such as no other single Greek state possesses, and moreover have many tribute-paying allies, how can it be easy to wage war against them, and on what confidence can we rush into it unprepared?

1.80.4
503
πότερον ταῖς ναυσίν;
Is it in our ships?

1.80.4
504
ἀλλ’ ἥσσους ἐσμέν;
But we are inferior.

1.80.4
505
εἰ δὲ μελετήσομεν καὶ ἀντιπαρασκευασόμεθα, χρόνος ἐνέσται.
If we practice and prepare, it will take time.

1.80.4
506
ἀλλὰ τοῖς χρήμασιν;
Or is it in our financial resources?

1.80.4
507
ἀλλὰ πολλῷ πλέον ἔτι τούτου ἐλλείπομεν καὶ οὔτε ἐν κοινῷ ἔχομεν οὔτε ἑτοίμως ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων φέρομεν.
But we are much more deficient in this and we neither have it in the public treasury nor readily contribute from our private resources.

1.81.1
508
τάχ’ ἄν τις θαρσοίη ὅτι τοῖς ὅπλοις αὐτῶν καὶ τῷ πλήθει ὑπερφέρομεν, ὥστε τὴν γῆν δῃοῦν ἐπιφοιτῶντες.
Perhaps someone might be confident because we excel them in arms and in numbers, so we could invade and ravage their land.

1.81.2
509
τοῖς δὲ ἄλλη γῆ ἐστὶ πολλὴ ἧς ἄρχουσι, καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ὧν δέονται ἐπάξονται.
But they have plenty of other land over which they rule, and they will import what they need by sea.

1.81.3
510
εἰ δ’ αὖ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀφιστάναι πειρασόμεθα, δεήσει καὶ τούτοις ναυσὶ βοηθεῖν τὸ πλέον οὖσι νησιώταις.
If we attempt to make their allies revolt, we will need to assist them with ships, as they are mostly islanders.

1.81.4
511
τίς οὖν ἔσται ἡμῶν ὁ πόλεμος;
What then will be the nature of our war?

1.81.4
512
εἰ μὴ γὰρ ἢ ναυσὶ κρατήσομεν ἢ τὰς προσόδους ἀφαιρήσομεν ἀφ’ ὧν τὸ ναυτικὸν τρέφουσι, βλαψόμεθα τὰ πλείω.
Unless we either conquer them by sea or take away the revenues which sustain their navy, we will suffer greater harm.

1.81.5
513
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ οὐδὲ καταλύεσθαι ἔτι καλόν, ἄλλως τε καὶ εἰ δόξομεν ἄρξαι μᾶλλον τῆς διαφορᾶς.
And in this matter, it is no longer honourable to relent, especially if we seem to be the ones starting the conflict.

1.81.6
514
μὴ γὰρ δὴ ἐκείνῃ γε τῇ ἐλπίδι ἐπαιρώμεθα ὡς ταχὺ παυσθήσεται ὁ πόλεμος, ἢν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν τέμωμεν.
For let us not be uplifted by the hope that the war will quickly end if we ravage their land.

1.81.6
515
δέδοικα δὲ μᾶλλον μὴ καὶ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτὸν ὑπολίπωμεν;
But I fear more that we might leave the war to our children;

1.81.6
516
οὕτως εἰκὸς Ἀθηναίους φρονήματι μήτε τῇ γῇ δουλεῦσαι μήτε ὥσπερ ἀπείρους καταπλαγῆναι τῷ πολέμῳ.
So likely are the Athenians neither to be enslaved in spirit to their land nor to be panic-stricken by the war like inexperienced men.

1.82.1
517
οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ ἀναισθήτως αὐτοὺς κελεύω τούς τε ξυμμάχους ἡμῶν ἐᾶν βλάπτειν καὶ ἐπιβουλεύοντας μὴ καταφωρᾶν, ἀλλὰ ὅπλα μὲν μήπω κινεῖν, πέμπειν δὲ καὶ αἰτιᾶσθαι μήτε πόλεμον ἄγαν δηλοῦντας μήθ’ ὡς ἐπιτρέψομεν, καὶ ἐν τούτῳ καὶ τὰ ἡμέτερ’ αὐτῶν ἐξαρτύεσθαι ξυμμάχων τε προσαγωγῇ καὶ Ἑλλήνων καὶ βαρβάρων, εἴ ποθέν τινα ἢ ναυτικοῦ ἢ χρημάτων δύναμιν προσληψόμεθα (ἀνεπίφθονον δέ, ὅσοι ὥσπερ καὶ ἡμεῖς ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων ἐπιβουλευόμεθα, μὴ Ἕλληνας μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ βαρβάρους προσλαβόντας διασωθῆναι), καὶ τὰ αὑτῶν ἅμα ἐκποριζώμεθα.
However, I do not advise that we should ignore them harming our allies and plotting against us; but rather not to initiate military action at this time, but to send envoys and lodge complaints, neither overtly signalling war nor appearing to tolerate their actions, and in the meantime, to prepare ourselves, gathering allies from both Greeks and barbarians, if we can acquire additional strength in ships or finances (it is without reproach to accept help not only from Greeks but also from barbarians, as we, like others, are targeted by the Athenians), and to develop our own resources.

1.82.2
518
καὶ ἢν μὲν ἐσακούωσί τι πρεσβευομένων ἡμῶν, ταῦτα ἄριστα;
And if they heed our ambassadors, that would be the best outcome;

1.82.2
519
ἢν δὲ μή, διελθόντων ἐτῶν δύο καὶ τριῶν ἄμεινον ἤδη, ἢν δοκῇ, πεφραγμένοι ἴμεν ἐπ’ αὐτούς.
but if not, after two or three years, it would be better to approach them, if it seems right, well-prepared.

1.82.3
520
καὶ ἴσως ὁρῶντες ἡμῶν ἤδη τήν τε παρασκευὴν καὶ τοὺς λόγους αὐτῇ ὁμοῖα ὑποσημαίνοντας μᾶλλον ἂν εἴκοιεν, καὶ γῆν ἔτι ἄτμητον ἔχοντες καὶ περὶ παρόντων ἀγαθῶν καὶ οὔπω ἐφθαρμένων βουλευόμενοι.
And perhaps seeing our readiness and our words indicating the same, they might be more inclined to comply, having their land still unharmed and deliberating about present goods not yet destroyed.

1.82.4
521
μὴ γὰρ ἄλλο τι νομίσητε τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ἢ ὅμηρον ἔχειν καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον ὅσῳ ἄμεινον ἐξείργασται.
Do not consider their land as anything other than a hostage, and the more valuable it is, the less we should disregard it.

1.82.4
522
ἧς φείδεσθαι χρὴ ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον, καὶ μὴ ἐς ἀπόνοιαν καταστήσαντας αὐτοὺς ἀληπτοτέρους ἔχειν.
We must spare it as much as possible and not drive them to desperation, making them more elusive to capture.

1.82.5
523
εἰ γὰρ ἀπαράσκευοι τοῖς τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐγκλήμασιν ἐπειχθέντες τεμοῦμεν αὐτήν, ὁρᾶτε ὅπως μὴ αἴσχιον καὶ ἀπορώτερον τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ πράξομεν.
For if, unprepared and swayed by our allies' complaints, we ravage their land, consider how we might act more dishonorably and problematically for the Peloponnese.

1.82.6
524
ἐγκλήματα μὲν γὰρ καὶ πόλεων καὶ ἰδιωτῶν οἷόν τε καταλῦσαι.
Complaints from both cities and individuals can indeed be settled.

1.82.6
525
πόλεμον δὲ ξύμπαντας ἀραμένους ἕνεκα τῶν ἰδίων, ὃν οὐχ ὑπάρχει εἰδέναι καθ’ ὅτι χωρήσει, οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὐπρεπῶς θέσθαι.
But a war, undertaken by all for their own interests, whose outcome is uncertain, is not easily resolved in an honorable manner.

1.83.1
526
καὶ ἀνανδρία μηδενὶ πολλοὺς μιᾷ πόλει μὴ ταχὺ ἐπελθεῖν δοκείτω εἶναι.
And let no one think it cowardly for many not to swiftly attack one city.

1.83.2
527
εἰσὶ γὰρ καὶ ἐκείνοις οὐκ ἐλάσσους χρήματα φέροντες ξύμμαχοι, καὶ ἔστιν ὁ πόλεμος οὐχ ὅπλων τὸ πλέον ἀλλὰ δαπάνης, δι’ ἣν τὰ ὅπλα ὠφελεῖ, ἄλλως τε καὶ ἠπειρώταις πρὸς θαλασσίους.
For they too have allies who contribute no less money, and war is more about the expense, which makes arms effective, than about arms themselves, especially for land powers against maritime forces.

1.83.3
528
πορισώμεθα οὖν πρῶτον αὐτήν, καὶ μὴ τοῖς τῶν ξυμμάχων λόγοις πρότερον ἐπαιρώμεθα, οἵπερ δὲ καὶ τῶν ἀποβαινόντων τὸ πλέον ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα τῆς αἰτίας ἕξομεν, οὗτοι καὶ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν τι αὐτῶν προΐδωμεν.
Therefore, let us first secure our resources, and not be prematurely swayed by the words of our allies; we bear the greater part of the outcome for either side, so let us carefully foresee these things.

1.84.1
529
καὶ τὸ βραδὺ καὶ μέλλον, ὃ μέμφονται μάλιστα ἡμῶν, μὴ αἰσχύνεσθε.
And do not be ashamed of the slowness and hesitation, which are most criticized in us.

1.84.1
530
σπεύδοντές τε γὰρ σχολαίτερον ἂν παύσαισθε διὰ τὸ ἀπαράσκευοι ἐγχειρεῖν, καὶ ἅμα ἐλευθέραν καὶ εὐδοξοτάτην πόλιν διὰ παντὸς νεμόμεθα.
For by hastening, you would end more slowly due to initiating unprepared; and we always maintain a free and most glorious city.

1.84.2
531
καὶ δύναται μάλιστα σωφροσύνη ἔμφρων τοῦτ’ εἶναι.
And such moderation can be the wisest prudence.

1.84.2
532
μόνοι γὰρ δι’ αὐτὸ εὐπραγίαις τε οὐκ ἐξυβρίζομεν καὶ ξυμφοραῖς ἧσσον ἑτέρων εἴκομεν.
For it is because of this we do not become insolent in prosperity and yield less than others in misfortune.

1.84.2
533
τῶν τε ξὺν ἐπαίνῳ ἐξοτρυνόντων ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ τὰ δεινὰ παρὰ τὸ δοκοῦν ἡμῖν οὐκ ἐπαιρόμεθα ἡδονῇ, καὶ ἤν τις ἄρα ξὺν κατηγορίᾳ παροξύνῃ, οὐδὲν δὴ μᾶλλον ἀχθεσθέντες ἀνεπείσθημεν.
We do not become excited by the pleasure of those who, with praise, urge us to undertake dangerous actions contrary to our judgment, and if anyone incites us with criticism, we are not more persuaded by being annoyed.

1.84.3
534
πολεμικοί τε καὶ εὔβουλοι διὰ τὸ εὔκοσμον γ

1.84.4
535
αἰεὶ δὲ ὡς πρὸς εὖ βουλευομένους τοὺς ἐναντίους ἔργῳ παρασκευαζόμεθα;
We always prepare in deed against our adversaries as if they are well-advised.

1.84.4
536
καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἐκείνων ὡς ἁμαρτησομένων ἔχειν δεῖ τὰς ἐλπίδας, ἀλλ’ ὡς ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἀσφαλῶς προνοουμένων.
And we must not place our hopes on the errors of others, but on our own secure foresight.

1.84.4
537
πολὺ τε διαφέρειν οὐ δεῖ νομίζειν ἄνθρωπον ἀνθρώπου, κράτιστον δὲ εἶναι ὅστις ἐν τοῖς ἀναγκαιοτάτοις παιδεύεται.
And one should not think there is a great difference from one man to another, but the best is he who is trained in the most necessary matters.

1.85.1
538
ταύτας οὖν ἃς οἱ πατέρες τε ἡμῖν παρέδοσαν μελέτας καὶ αὐτοὶ διὰ παντὸς ὠφελούμενοι ἔχομεν μὴ παρῶμεν, μηδὲ ἐπειχθέντες ἐν βραχεῖ μορίῳ ἡμέρας περὶ πολλῶν σωμάτων καὶ χρημάτων καὶ πόλεων καὶ δόξης βουλεύσωμεν, ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν.
Therefore, let us not abandon the practices our fathers handed down to us, practices which have always benefited us, nor should we make decisions about the lives, wealth, cities, and honor of many in a short part of a day, but do so calmly.

1.85.1
539
ἔξεστι δ’ ἡμῖν μᾶλλον ἑτέρων διὰ ἰσχύν.
We, more than others, have the power to do this.

1.85.2
540
καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους πέμπετε μὲν περὶ τῆς Ποτειδαίας, πέμπετε δὲ περὶ ὧν οἱ ξύμμαχοί φασιν ἀδικεῖσθαι, ἄλλως τε καὶ ἑτοίμων ὄντων αὐτῶν δίκας δοῦναι.
Send envoys to the Athenians about Potidaea and about what our allies claim as their injustices, especially since the Athenians are prepared to offer justice.

1.85.2
541
ἐπὶ δὲ τὸν διδόντα οὐ πρότερον νόμιμον ὡς ἐπ’ ἀδικοῦντα ἰέναι.
It's not right to proceed against those offering to provide justice as though they are wrongdoers.

1.85.2
542
παρασκευάζεσθε δὲ τὸν πόλεμον ἅμα.
But prepare for war at the same time.

1.85.2
543
ταῦτα γὰρ καὶ κράτιστα βουλεύσεσθε καὶ τοῖς ἐναντίοις φοβερώτατα.
For this will be the wisest course of action and the most formidable to our opponents.

1.85.3
544
καὶ ὁ μὲν Ἀρχίδαμος τοιαῦτα εἶπεν.
And thus spoke Archidamus.

1.85.3
545
παρελθὼν δὲ Σθενελαΐδας τελευταῖος, εἷς τῶν ἐφόρων τότε ὤν, ἔλεξεν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ὧδε.
Then Sthenelaidas, who was one of the Ephors at that time, came forward last and said to the Lacedaemonians as follows.

1.86.1
546
τοὺς μὲν λόγους τοὺς πο

1.86.1
547
ἐπαινέσαντες γὰρ πολλὰ ἑαυτοὺς οὐδαμοῦ ἀντεῖπον ὡς οὐκ ἀδικοῦσι τοὺς ἡμετέρους ξυμμάχους καὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον.
For though they praised themselves greatly, they nowhere denied that they are wronging our allies and the Peloponnese.

1.86.1
548
καίτοι εἰ πρὸς τοὺς Μήδους ἐγένοντο ἀγαθοὶ τότε, πρὸς δ’ ἡμᾶς κακοὶ νῦν, διπλασίας ζημίας ἄξιοί εἰσιν, ὅτι ἀντ’ ἀγαθῶν κακοὶ γεγένηνται.
And yet if they were good against the Medes then but are bad against us now, they deserve double punishment for turning from good to bad.

1.86.2
549
ἡμεῖς δὲ ὁμοῖοι καὶ τότε καὶ νῦν ἐσμέν, καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους, ἢν σωφρονῶμεν, οὐ περιοψόμεθα ἀδικουμένους οὐδὲ μελλήσομεν τιμωρεῖν.
We are the same, both then and now, and if we are sensible, we will not overlook our allies being wronged nor delay in avenging them.

1.86.2
550
οἱ δ’ οὐκέτι μέλλουσι κακῶς πάσχειν.
The [allies] are no longer just about to suffer harm.

1.86.3
551
ἄλλοις μὲν γὰρ χρήματά ἐστι πολλὰ καὶ νῆες καὶ ἵπποι, ἡμῖν δὲ ξύμμαχοι ἀγαθοί, οὓς οὐ παραδοτέα τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐστίν, οὐδὲ δίκαις καὶ λόγοις διακριτέα μὴ λόγῳ καὶ αὐτοὺς βλαπτομένους, ἀλλὰ τιμωρητέα ἐν τάχει καὶ παντὶ σθένει.
Others may have ample wealth, ships, and horses, but we have good allies, whom we must not hand over to the Athenians, nor should we leave their fate to trials and negotiations while they are being harmed in reality; instead, we should defend them swiftly and with all our strength.

1.86.4
552
καὶ ὡς ἡμᾶς πρέπει βουλεύεσθαι ἀδικουμένους μηδεὶς διδασκέτω, ἀλλὰ τοὺς μέλλοντας ἀδικεῖν μᾶλλον πρέπει πολὺν χρόνον βουλεύεσθαι.
And let no one dictate to us how we should deliberate when we are being wronged; rather, it is those who intend to commit injustice who should spend a great deal of time in deliberation.

1.86.5
553
ψηφίζεσθε οὖν, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, ἀξίως τῆς Σπάρτης τὸν πόλεμον, καὶ μήτε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐᾶτε μείζους γίγνεσθαι μήτε τοὺς ξυμμάχους καταπροδιδῶμεν, ἀλλὰ ξὺν τοῖς θεοῖς ἐπίωμεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας.
Therefore, vote, O Lacedaemonians, for war, as is befitting of Sparta; neither allow the Athenians to grow stronger nor betray our allies, but with the help of the gods, let us move against those who commit injustice.

1.87.1
554
τοιαῦτα λέξας ἐπεψήφιζεν αὐτὸς ἔφορος ὢν ἐς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων.
Having said this, he, being an ephor, put it to a vote in the assembly of the Lacedaemonians.

1.87.2
555
ὁ δέ (κρίνουσι γὰρ βοῇ καὶ οὐ ψήφῳ) οὐκ ἔφη διαγιγνώσκειν τὴν βοὴν ὁποτέρα μείζων, ἀλλὰ βουλόμενος αὐτοὺς φανερῶς ἀπο

1.87.2
556
ἀναστάντες δὲ διέστησαν, καὶ πολλῷ πλείους ἐγένοντο οἷς ἐδόκουν αἱ σπονδαὶ λελύσθαι.
They arose and divided, and there was a large majority who thought that the treaty had been broken.

1.87.4
557
προσκαλέσαντές τε τοὺς ξυμμάχους εἶπον ὅτι σφίσι μὲν δοκοῖεν ἀδικεῖν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι, βούλεσθαι δὲ καὶ τοὺς πάντας ξυμμάχους παρακαλέσαντες ψῆφον ἐπαγαγεῖν, ὅπως κοινῇ βουλευσάμενοι τὸν πόλεμον ποιῶνται, ἢν δοκῇ.
Having summoned the allies, they declared that in their opinion the Athenians were acting unjustly. They wished to invite all the allies to cast a vote, so that after jointly consulting, they could decide whether to go to war.

1.87.5
558
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου διαπραξάμενοι ταῦτα, καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναίων πρέσβεις ὕστερον ἐφ’ ἅπερ ἦλθον χρηματίσαντες.
After this decision, they departed to their homes, and later the Athenian ambassadors also left, having completed the business for which they had come.

1.87.6
559
ἡ δὲ διαγνώμη αὕτη τῆς ἐκκλησίας, τοῦ τὰς σπονδὰς λελύσθαι, ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ τετάρτῳ καὶ δεκάτῳ ἔτει τῶν τριακοντουτίδων σπονδῶν προκεχωρηκυιῶν, αἳ ἐγένοντο μετὰ τὰ Εὐβοϊκά.
This decision of the assembly, declaring that the truce had been violated, occurred in the fourteenth year of the Thirty Years' Truce, which had been established after the conflicts in Euboea.

1.88.1
560
ἐψηφίσαντο δὲ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὰς σπονδὰς λελύσθαι καὶ πολεμητέα εἶναι οὐ τοσοῦτον τῶν ξυμμάχων πεισθέντες τοῖς λόγοις ὅσον φοβούμενοι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μὴ ἐπὶ μεῖζον δυνηθῶσιν, ὁρῶντες αὐτοῖς τὰ πολλὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ὑποχείρια ἤδη ὄντα.
The Lacedaemonians voted that the truce had been broken and that war should be declared. Their decision was influenced not so much by the arguments of their allies as by their fear that the Athenians, already controlling much of Greece, might grow even stronger.

1.89.1
561
οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι τρόπῳ τοιῷδε ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὰ πράγματα ἐν οἷς ηὐξήθησαν.
For the Athenians had reached their current position of power in the following manner.

1.89.2
562
ἐπειδὴ Μῆδοι ἀνεχώρησαν ἐκ τῆς Εὐρώπης νικηθέντες καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ ὑπὸ Ἑλλήνων καὶ οἱ καταφυγόντες αὐτῶν ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐς Μυκάλην διεφθάρησαν, Λεωτυχίδης μὲν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων, ὅσπερ ἡγεῖτο τῶν ἐν Μυκάλῃ Ἑλλήνων, ἀπεχώρησεν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἔχων τοὺς ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου ξυμμάχους, οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ Ἰωνίας καὶ Ἑλλησπόντου ξύμμαχοι ἤδη ἀφεστηκότες ἀπὸ βασιλέως ὑπομείναντες Σηστὸν ἐπολιόρκουν Μήδων ἐχόντων, καὶ ἐπιχειμάσαντες εἷλον αὐτὴν ἐκλιπόντων τῶν βαρβάρων, καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἀπέπλευσαν ἐξ Ἑλλησπόντου ὡς ἕκαστοι κατὰ πόλεις.
After the Medes had been defeated and retreated from Europe, both by sea and land by the Greeks, and those of them who fled with their ships to Mycale were destroyed, Leotychides, the king of the Lacedaemonians, who led the Greeks at Mycale, returned home with the allies from the Peloponnese. The Athenians and their allies from Ionia and the Hellespont, having now revolted from the Persian king, remained and besieged Sestos, which was held by the Medes. After a winter siege, they captured it when the barbarians abandoned it, and then they sailed from the Hellespont back to their respective cities.

1.89.3
563
Ἀθηναίων δὲ τὸ κοινόν, ἐπειδὴ αὐτοῖς οἱ βάρβαροι ἐκ τῆς χώρας ἀπῆλθον, διεκομίζοντο εὐθὺς ὅθεν ὑπεξέθεντο παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας καὶ τὴν περιοῦσαν κατασκευήν, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἀνοικοδομεῖν παρεσκευάζοντο καὶ τὰ τείχη.
As soon as the barbarians had left their territory, the Athenians immediately brought back their children, wives, and remaining possessions from where they had been safeguarded. They began preparations to rebuild their city and its walls.

1.89.3
564
τοῦ τε γὰρ περιβόλου βραχέα εἱστήκει καὶ οἰκίαι αἱ μὲν πολλαὶ ἐπεπτώκεσαν, ὀλίγαι δὲ περιῆσαν, ἐν αἷς αὐτοὶ ἐσκήνωσαν οἱ δυνατοὶ τῶν Περσῶν.
Only small parts of the city walls were standing, and while many houses had fallen, a few remained, which had been occupied by the powerful Persians.

1.90.1
565
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ αἰσθόμενοι τὸ μέλλον ἦλθον πρεσβείᾳ, τὰ μὲν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἥδιον ἂν ὁρῶντες μήτ’ ἐκείνους μήτ’ ἄλλον μηδένα τεῖχος ἔχοντα, τὸ δὲ πλέον τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐξοτρυνόντων καὶ φοβουμένων τοῦ τε ναυτικοῦ αὐτῶν τὸ πλῆθος, ὃ πρὶν οὐχ ὑπῆρχε, καὶ τὴν ἐς τὸν Μηδικὸν πόλεμον τόλμαν γενομένην.
Aware of what was to come, the Lacedaemonians sent an embassy, partly because they themselves preferred that neither the Athenians nor anyone else should have walls, and partly because their allies urged them, fearing the Athenian fleet, which had recently grown, and the boldness shown in the Median War.

1.90.2
566
ἠξίουν τε αὐτοὺς μὴ τειχίζειν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἔξω Πελοποννήσου μᾶλλον ὅσοις εἱστήκει ξυγκαθελεῖν μετὰ σφῶν τοὺς περιβόλους, τὸ μὲν βουλόμενον καὶ ὕποπτον τῆς γνώμης οὐ δηλοῦντες ἐς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους, ὡς δὲ τοῦ βαρβάρου, εἰ αὖθις ἐπέλθοι, οὐκ ἂν ἔχοντος ἀπὸ ἐχυροῦ ποθέν, ὥσπερ νῦν ἐκ τῶν Θηβῶν, ὁρμᾶσθαι.
They demanded that the Athenians should not rebuild their walls and that the cities outside the Peloponnese should rather join them in demolishing their walls. This demand was made under the guise of preventing a barbarian invasion, should it occur again, from using fortified cities as a base, like Thebes was used

1.90.2
567
τήν τε Πελοπόννησον πᾶσιν ἔφασαν ἀναχώρησίν τε καὶ ἀφορμὴν ἱκανὴν εἶναι .
and the Peloponnese, they said, was sufficient for all, as a place to retreat into and sally forth from.

1.90.3
568
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι Θεμιστοκλέους γνώμῃ τοὺς μὲν Λακεδαιμονίους ταῦτ’ εἰπόντας ἀποκρινάμενοι ὅτι πέμψουσιν ὡς αὐτοὺς πρέσβεις περὶ ὧν λέγουσιν εὐθὺς ἀπήλλαξαν ·
Upon receiving this proposal, the Athenians, guided by Themistocles' advice, replied to the Lacedaemonians that they would send ambassadors to discuss the matters raised and promptly dismissed them.

1.90.3
569
ἑαυτὸν δ’ ἐκέλευεν ἀποστέλλειν ὡς τάχιστα ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα , ἄλλους δὲ πρὸς ἑαυτῷ ἑλομένους πρέσβεις μὴ εὐθὺς ἐκπέμπειν , ἀλλ’ ἐπισχεῖν μέχρι τοσούτου ἕως ἂν τὸ τεῖχος ἱκανὸν ἄρωσιν ὥστε ἀπομάχεσθαι ἐκ τοῦ ἀναγκαιοτάτου ὕψους ·
Themistocles then urged that he himself should be sent immediately to Lacedaemon, and that other chosen ambassadors should not be dispatched at once, but delayed until the wall was sufficiently built to a defensible height.

1.90.3
570
τειχίζειν δὲ πάντας πανδημεὶ τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ αὐτοὺς καὶ γυναῖκας καὶ παῖδας , φειδομένους μήτε ἰδίου μήτε δημοσίου οἰκοδομήματος ὅθεν τις ὠφελία ἔσται ἐς τὸ ἔργον , ἀλλὰ καθαιροῦντας πάντα .
He commanded that everyone in the city, including men, women, and children, should participate in the construction of the walls, sparing no private or public buildings if their materials could be useful for the task, and to dismantle everything as needed.

1.90.4
571
καὶ ὁ μὲν ταῦτα διδάξας καὶ ὑπειπὼν τ- ἄλλα ὅτι αὐτὸς τ- ἐκεῖ πράξοι ᾤχετο .
After providing these instructions and suggesting he would handle the remaining matters, he departed.

1.90.5
572
καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα ἐλθὼν οὐ προσῄει πρὸς τὰς ἀρχάς , ἀλλὰ διῆγε καὶ προυφασίζετο .
Upon arriving in Lacedaemon, he did not approach the authorities, but instead delayed and made excuses.

1.90.5
573
καὶ ὁπότε τις αὐτὸν ἔροιτο τῶν ἐν τέλει ὄντων ὅτι οὐκ ἐπέρχεται ἐπὶ τὸ κοινόν , ἔφη τοὺς ξυμπρέσβεις ἀναμένειν , ἀσχολίας δέ τινος οὔσης αὐτοὺς ὑπολειφθῆναι , προσδέχεσθαι μέντοι ἐν τάχει ἥξειν καὶ θαυμάζειν ὡς οὔπω πάρεισιν .
When asked by officials why he was not appearing in the public assembly, he claimed to be waiting for his fellow ambassadors, who were delayed due to some business, but he expected them to arrive soon and expressed surprise at their absence.

1.91.1
574
οἱ δὲ ἀκούοντες τῷ μὲν Θεμιστοκλεῖ ἐπείθοντο διὰ φιλίαν αὐτοῦ , τῶν δὲ ἄλλων ἀφικνουμένων καὶ σαφῶς κατηγορούντων ὅτι τειχίζεταί τε καὶ ἤδη ὕψος λαμβάνει , οὐκ εἶχον ὅπως χρὴ ἀπιστῆσαι .
The listeners trusted Themistocles due to their friendship with him. However, when others arrived and clearly reported that the walls were indeed being built and were already gaining height, they could not disregard this information.

1.91.2
575
γνοὺς δὲ ἐκεῖνος κελεύει αὐτοὺς μὴ λόγοις μᾶλλον παράγεσθαι ἢ πέμψαι σφῶν αὐτῶν ἄνδρας οἵτινες χρηστοὶ καὶ πιστῶς ἀναγγελοῦσι σκεψάμενοι .
Knowing their suspicions, Themistocles advised them not to be swayed by mere words but to send their own trustworthy men to inspect and report back accurately.

1.91.3
576
ἀποστέλλουσιν οὖν , καὶ περὶ αὐτῶν ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις κρύφα πέμπει κελεύων ὡς ἥκιστα ἐπιφανῶς κατασχεῖν καὶ μὴ ἀφεῖναι πρὶν ἂν αὐτοὶ πάλιν κομισθῶσιν ( ἤδη γὰρ καὶ ἧκον αὐτῷ οἱ ξυμπρέσβεις , Ἁβρώνιχός τε ὁ Λυσικλέους καὶ Ἀριστείδης ὁ Λυσιμάχου , ἀγγέλλοντες ἔχειν ἱκανῶς τὸ τεῖχος ) ἐφοβεῖτο γὰρ μὴ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι σφᾶς , ὁπότε σαφῶς ἀκούσειαν , οὐκέτι ἀφῶσιν .
They despatched them therefore; and Themistocles secretly sent directions about them to the Athenians, to detain them, with as little appearance of it as possible, and not to let them go until they themselves had returned back; (for by this time his colleagues, Abronychus, the son of Lysicles, and Aristides, the son of Lysimachus, had also come to him with the news that the wall was sufficiently advanced;) for he was afraid that the Lacedaemonians, when they heard the truth, might not then let them go.

1.91.4
577
οἵ τε οὖν Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς πρέσβεις , ὥσπερ ἐπεστάλη , κατεῖχον , καὶ ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς ἐπελθὼν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐνταῦθα δὴ φανερῶς εἶπεν ὅτι ἡ μὲν πόλις σφῶν τετείχισται ἤδη ὥστε ἱκανὴ εἶναι σῴζειν τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας , εἰ δέ τι βούλονται Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἢ οἱ ξύμμαχοι πρεσβεύεσθαι παρὰ σφᾶς , ὡς πρὸς διαγιγνώσκοντας τὸ λοιπὸν ἰέναι τά τε σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ξύμφορα καὶ τὰ κοινά .
So the Athenians detained the ambassadors, as was told them; and Themistocles, having come to an audience of the Lacedaemonians, then indeed told them plainly that their city was already walled, so as to be capable of defending its inhabitants; and if the Lacedaemonians or the allies wished to send any embassy to them, they should in future go as to men who could discern what were their own and the general interests.

1.91.5
578
τήν τε γὰρ πόλιν ὅτε ἐδόκει ἐκλιπεῖν ἄμεινον εἶναι καὶ ἐς τὰς ναῦς ἐσβῆναι , ἄνευ ἐκείνων ἔφασαν γνόντες τολμῆσαι , καὶ ὅσα αὖ μετ’ ἐκείνων βουλεύεσθαι , οὐδενὸς ὕστεροι γνώμῃ φανῆναι .
For when they thought it better to abandon their city and to go on board their ships, they said that they had made up their minds, and had the courage to do it, without consulting them; and again, on whatever matters they had deliberated with them, they had shown themselves inferior to none in judgment.

1.91.6
579
δοκεῖν οὖν σφίσι καὶ νῦν ἄμεινον εἶναι τὴν ἑαυτῶν πόλιν τεῖχος ἔχειν , καὶ ἰδίᾳ τοῖς πολίταις καὶ ἐς τοὺς πάντας ξυμμάχους ὠφελιμώτερον ἔσεσθαι ·
And so at the present time, likewise, they thought it was better that their city should have a wall, and that it would be more expedient for their citizens in particular, as well as for the allies in general;

1.91.7
580
οὐ γὰρ οἷόν τ’ εἶναι μὴ ἀπὸ ἀντιπάλου παρασκευῆς ὁμοῖόν τι ἢ ἴσον ἐς τὸ κοινὸν βουλεύεσθαι .
for it was not possible for any one without equal resources to give any equal or fair advice for the common good.

1.91.7
581
ἢ πάντας οὖν ἀτειχίστους ἔφη χρῆναι ξυμμαχεῖν ἢ καὶ τάδε νομίζειν ὀρθῶς ἔχειν .
Either all therefore, he said, should join the confederacy without walls, or they should consider that the present case also was as it ought to be.

1.92.1
582
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀκούσαντες ὀργὴν μὲν φανερὰν οὐκ ἐποιοῦντο τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ( οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐπὶ κωλύμῃ , ἀλλὰ γνώμης παραινέσει δῆθεν τῷ κοινῷ ἐπρεσβεύσαντο , ἅμα δὲ καὶ προσφιλεῖς ὄντες ἐν τῷ τότε διὰ τὴν ἐς τὸν Μῆδον προθυμίαν τὰ μάλιστ’ αὐτοῖς ἐτύγχανον ) , τῆς μέντοι βουλήσεως ἁμαρτάνοντες ἀδήλως ἤχθοντο .
The Lacedaemonians, on hearing this, did not let their anger appear to the Athenians; (for they had not sent their embassy to obstruct their designs, but to offer counsel, they said, to their state; and besides, they were at that time on very friendly terms with them owing to their zeal against the Mede;) in secret, however, they were annoyed at failing in their wish.

1.92.1
583
οἵ τε πρέσβεις ἑκατέρων ἀπῆλθον ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀνεπικλήτως .
So the ambassadors of each state returned home without any complaint being made.

1.93.1
584
τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὴν πόλιν ἐτείχισαν ἐν ὀλίγῳ χρόνῳ .
In this way the Athenians walled their city in a short time.

1.93.2
585
καὶ δήλη ἡ οἰκοδομία ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐστὶν ὅτι κατὰ σπουδὴν ἐγένετο ·
And the building still shows even now that it was executed in haste; for the foundations are laid with stones of all kinds, and in some places not wrought together, but as the several parties at any time brought them to the spot: and many columns from tombs, and wrought stones, were worked up in them.

1.93.2
586
οἱ γὰρ θεμέλιοι παντοίων λίθων ὑπόκεινται καὶ οὐ ξυνειργασμένων ἔστιν ᾗ , ἀλλ’ ὡς ἕκαστόν ποτε προσέφερον , πολλαί τε στῆλαι ἀπὸ σημάτων καὶ λίθοι εἰργασμένοι ἐγκατελέγησαν .
For the foundations are laid with stones of all kinds, and in some places not wrought together, but as each party brought them at any time, and many pillars from monuments and worked stones were included.

1.93.2
587
μείζων γὰρ ὁ περίβολος πανταχῇ ἐξήχθη τ

1.93.3
588
ἔπεισε δὲ καὶ τοῦ Πειραιῶς τὰ λοιπὰ ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς οἰκοδομεῖν ( ὑπῆρκτο δ’ αὐτοῦ πρότερον ἐπὶ τῆς ἐκείνου ἀρχῆς ἧς κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν Ἀθηναίοις ἦρξε ) νομίζων τό τε χωρίον καλὸν εἶναι , λιμένας ἔχον τρεῖς αὐτοφυεῖς , καὶ αὐτοὺς ναυτικοὺς γεγενημένους μέγα προφέρειν ἐς τὸ κτήσασθαι δύναμιν ( τῆς γὰρ δὴ θαλάσσης πρῶτος ἐτόλμησεν εἰπεῖν ὡς ἀνθεκτέα ἐστί ) , καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν εὐθὺς ξυγκατεσκεύαζεν .
Themistocles also persuaded them to build the remaining walls of the Piraeus, (they had been begun by him before, at the time of his office as archon, which he had held for a year over the Athenians,) thinking that the site was a fine one, as it contained three natural harbours; and that by becoming a naval people they would make a great advance towards the acquisition of power.

1.93.5
589
καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν τῇ ἐκείνου γνώμῃ τὸ πάχος τοῦ τείχους ὅπερ νῦν ἔτι δῆλόν ἐστι περὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ ·
It was by his advice that they built the walls of that thickness which is still seen round the Piraeus; for two waggons meeting each other brought up the stones.

1.93.5
590
δύο γὰρ ἅμαξαι ἐναντίαι ἀλλήλαις τοὺς λίθους ἐπῆγον .
For two waggons meeting each other brought up the stones.

1.93.5
591
ἐντὸς δὲ οὔτε χάλιξ οὔτε πηλὸς ἦν , ἀλλὰ ξυνῳκοδομημένοι μεγάλοι λίθοι καὶ ἐντομῇ ἐγγώνιοι , σιδήρῳ πρὸς ἀλλήλους τὰ ἔξωθεν καὶ μολύβδῳ δεδεμένοι .
And in the inside there was neither rubble nor mortar, but large and square-cut stones wrought together, cramped on the outside with iron and lead.

1.93.5
592
τὸ δὲ ὕψος ἥμισυ μάλιστα ἐτελέσθη οὗ διενοεῖτο .
But only about half of the height he intended was finished.

1.93.6
593
ἐβούλετο γὰρ τῷ μεγέθει καὶ τῷ πάχει ἀφιστάναι τὰς τῶν πολεμίων ἐπιβουλάς , ἀνθρώπων τε ἐνόμιζεν ὀλίγων καὶ τῶν ἀχρειοτάτων ἀρκέσειν τὴν φυλακήν , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους ἐς τὰς ναῦς ἐσβήσεσθαι .
For he wished by their great dimensions and thickness to keep off the attacks of their enemies; and thought that the protection of a few, and those the least efficient troops, would be sufficient, while the rest would go on board their ships.

1.93.7
594
ταῖς γὰρ ναυσὶ μάλιστα προσέκειτο , ἰδών , ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , τῆς βασιλέως στρατιᾶς τὴν κατὰ θάλασσαν ἔφοδον εὐπορωτέραν τῆς κατὰ γῆν οὖσαν ·
For to the navy he paid the greatest attention; seeing, I suppose, that the approach of the king's forces against them was easier by sea than by land.

1.93.7
595
τόν τε Πειραιᾶ ὠφελιμώτερον ἐνόμιζε τῆς ἄνω πόλεως , καὶ πολλάκις τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις παρῄνει , ἢν ἄρα ποτὲ κατὰ γῆν βιασθῶσι , καταβάντας ἐς αὐτὸν ταῖς ναυσὶ πρὸς ἅπαντας ἀνθίστασθαι .
And he considered the Piraeus more serviceable than the upper city, and often advised the Athenians, in case of their ever being hard pressed by land, to go down into it, and defy the world with their navy.

1.93.8
596
Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν οὖν οὕτως ἐτειχίσθησαν καὶ τ- ἄλλα κατεσκευάζοντο εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν Μήδων ἀναχώρησιν .
Thus then the Athenians were enclosed with walls, and began to furnish themselves with other buildings immediately after the retreat of the Medes.

1.94.1
597
Παυσανίας δὲ ὁ Κλεομβρότου ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος στρατηγὸς τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐξεπέμφθη μετὰ εἴκοσι νεῶν ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου ·
Now Pausanias, the son of Cleombrotus, was sent out from Lacedaemon as general of the Greeks with twenty ships from the Peloponnese;

1.94.1
598
ξυνέπλεον δὲ καὶ Ἀθηναῖο

1.94.2
599
καὶ ἐστράτευσαν ἐς Κύπρον καὶ αὐτῆς τὰ πολλὰ κατεστρέψαντο , καὶ ὕστερον ἐς Βυζάντιον Μήδων ἐχόντων , καὶ ἐξεπολιόρκησαν ἐν τῇδε τῇ ἡγεμονίᾳ .
And they made an expedition against Cyprus, and subdued the greater part of it; and afterwards against Byzantium, of which the Medes were in possession, and reduced it during this period of his command.

1.95.1
600
ἤδη δὲ βιαίου ὄντος αὐτοῦ οἵ τε ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες ἤχθοντο καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα οἱ Ἴωνες καὶ ὅσοι ἀπὸ βασιλέως νεωστὶ ἠλευθέρωντο ·
But when he was now acting with violence, the rest of the Greeks were offended, and especially the Ionians, and such as had lately been liberated from the king;

1.95.1
601
φοιτῶντές τε πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἠξίουν αὐτοὺς ἡγεμόνας σφῶν γίγνεσθαι κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς καὶ Παυσανίᾳ μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν , ἤν που βιάζηται .
And going to the Athenians, they begged them to become their leaders, on the ground of their relationship; and not to overlook it in Pausanias, if in any case he should treat them with violence.

1.95.2
602
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐδέξαντό τε τοὺς λόγους καὶ προσεῖχον τὴν γνώμην ὡς οὐ περιοψόμενοι τ- ἄλλα τε καταστησόμενοι ᾗ φαίνοιτο ἄριστα αὐτοῖς .
The Athenians received their proposals, and attended to them with a determination not to overlook it, and to settle all other matters as might seem best to them.

1.95.3
603
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι μετεπέμποντο Παυσανίαν ἀνακρινοῦντες ὧν πέρι ἐπυνθάνοντο ·
At this time the Lacedaemonians sent for Pausanias, to bring him to account for what they had heard of him;

1.95.3
604
καὶ γὰρ ἀδικία πολλὴ κατηγορεῖτο αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων τῶν ἀφικνουμένων , καὶ τυραννίδος μᾶλλον ἐφαίνετο μίμησις ἢ στρατηγία .
For many charges were brought against him by the Greeks who came to them; and it appeared to be an imitation of a tyranny, rather than the command of a general.

1.95.4
605
ξυνέβη τε αὐτῷ καλεῖσθαί τε ἅμα καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους τῷ ἐκείνου ἔχθει παρ’ Ἀθηναίους μετατάξασθαι πλὴν τῶν ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου στρατιωτῶν .
It happened that he was summoned at the very time the allies, through their hatred of him, went over and ranged themselves with the Athenians, except the soldiers from the Peloponnese.

1.95.5
606
ἐλθὼν δὲ ἐς Λακεδαίμονα τῶν μὲν ἰδίᾳ πρός τινα ἀδικημάτων ηὐθύνθη , τὰ δὲ μέγιστα ἀπολύεται μὴ ἀδικεῖν ·
So when he came to Lacedaemon, he was censured for the wrongs he had done to any one individually; but was acquitted, as not guilty, on the heaviest charges.

1.95.5
607
κατηγορεῖτο δὲ αὐτοῦ οὐχ ἥκιστα μηδισμὸς καὶ ἐδόκει σαφέστατον εἶναι .
(He was especially accused of medizing, and it appeared to be most clearly established.)

1.95.6
608
καὶ ἐκεῖνον μὲν οὐκέτι ἐκπέμπουσιν ἄρχοντα , Δόρκιν δὲ καὶ ἄλλους τινὰς μετ’ αὐτοῦ στρατιὰν ἔχοντας οὐ πολλήν ·
Him they sent out no more as commander, but Dorcis and some others with him, with no great number of troops;

1.95.6
609
οἷς οὐκέτι ἐφίεσαν οἱ ξύμμαχοι τὴν ἡγεμονίαν .
But the allies would no longer give up the command to them.

1.95.7
610
οἱ δὲ αἰσθόμενοι ἀπῆλθον , καὶ ἄλλους οὐκέτι ὕστερον ἐξέπεμψαν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , φοβούμενοι μὴ σφίσιν οἱ ἐξιόντες χείρους γίγνωνται , ὅπερ καὶ ἐν τῷ Παυσανίᾳ ἐνεῖδον , ἀπαλλαξείοντες δὲ καὶ τοῦ Μηδικοῦ πολέμου καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους νομίζοντες ἱκανοὺς ἐξηγεῖσθαι καὶ σφίσιν ἐν τῷ τότε παρόντι ἐπιτηδείους .
On finding this, they returned; and the Lacedaemonians sent out no others after them; fearing that they might find those who went abroad becoming corrupted, just as they saw in the case of Pausanias; and also because they wished to be rid of the Median war, and considered the Athenians competent to take the lead, and well disposed towards themselves at that time.

1.96.1
611
παραλαβόντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὴν ἡγεμονίαν τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἑκόντων τῶν ξυμμάχων διὰ τὸ Παυσανίου μῖσος , ἔταξαν ἅς τε ἔδει παρέχειν τῶν πόλεων χρήματα πρὸς τὸν βάρβαρον καὶ ἃς ναῦς ·
The Athenians having in this way succeeded to the command at the wish of the allies, owing to their hatred of Pausanias, arranged which of the states were to furnish money against the barbarian, and which of them ships.

1.96.1
612
πρόσχημα γὰρ ἦν ἀμύνεσθαι ὧν ἔπαθον δῃοῦντας τὴν βασιλέως χώραν .
For their pretext was to avenge themselves for what they had suffered, by ravaging the king's country.

1.96.2
613
καὶ Ἑλληνοταμίαι τότε πρῶτον Ἀθηναίοις κατέστη ἀρχή , οἳ ἐδέχοντο τὸν φόρον ·
And the office of treasurers of Greece was then first established by the Athenians; who received the tribute, for so the contribution-money was called.

1.96.2
614
οὕτω γὰρ ὠνομάσθη τῶν χρημάτων ἡ φορά .
The first tribute that was fixed was 460 talents.

1.96.2
615
ἦν δ’ ὁ πρῶτος φόρος ταχθεὶς τετρακόσια τάλαντα καὶ ἑξήκοντα .
Their treasury was at Delos, and their meetings were held in the temple.

1.96.2
616
ταμιεῖόν τε Δῆλος ἦν αὐτοῖς , καὶ αἱ ξύνοδοι ἐς τὸ ἱερὸν ἐγίγνοντο .
Now they led the allies at first as possessing independence, and deliberating in common councils;

1.97.1
617
ἡγούμενοι δὲ αὐτονόμων τὸ πρῶτον τῶν ξυμμάχων καὶ ἀπὸ κοινῶν ξυνόδων βουλευόντων τοσάδε ἐπῆλθον πολέμῳ τε καὶ διαχειρίσει πραγμάτων μεταξὺ τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου καὶ τοῦ Μηδικοῦ , ἃ ἐγένετο πρός τε τὸν βάρβαρον αὐτοῖς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς σφετέρους ξυμμάχους νεωτερίζοντας καὶ Πελοποννησίων τοὺς αἰεὶ προ

1.97.2
618
ἔγραψα δὲ αὐτὰ καὶ τὴν ἐκβολὴν τοῦ λόγου ἐποιησάμην διὰ τόδε , ὅτι τοῖς πρὸ ἐμοῦ ἅπασιν ἐκλιπὲς τοῦτο ἦν τὸ χωρίον καὶ ἢ τὰ πρὸ τῶν Μηδικῶν Ἑλληνικὰ ξυνετίθεσαν ἢ αὐτὰ τὰ Μηδικά ·
I have written an account of these events, and made this digression from my history, because this subject was omitted by all before me; who either wrote the history of Greece before the Median war, or of that war itself.

1.97.2
619
τούτων δὲ ὅσπερ καὶ ἥψατο ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ξυγγραφῇ Ἑλλάνικος , βραχέως τε καὶ τοῖς χρόνοις οὐκ ἀκριβῶς ἐπεμνήσθη .
And Hellanicus, who did touch on them in his Attic history, mentioned them but briefly, and not accurately with regard to their chronology.

1.97.2
620
ἅμα δὲ καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἀπόδειξιν ἔχει τῆς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐν οἵῳ τρόπῳ κατέστη .
Besides, they also afford an opportunity of showing in what manner the empire of the Athenians was established.

1.98.1
621
πρῶτον μὲν Ἠιόνα τὴν ἐπὶ Στρυμόνι Μήδων ἐχόντων πολιορκίᾳ εἷλον καὶ ἠνδραπόδισαν , Κίμωνος τοῦ Μιλτιάδου στρατηγοῦντος .
In the first place, Eion on the Strymon, of which the Medes were in possession, was taken by them after a siege, and reduced to slavery, under the command of Cimon, the son of Miltiades.

1.98.2
622
ἔπειτα Σκῦρον τὴν ἐν τῷ Αἰγαίῳ νῆσον , ἣν ᾤκουν Δόλοπες , ἠνδραπόδισαν καὶ ᾤκισαν αὐτοί .
In the next place, Scyros, the island in the Aegean Sea, which was inhabited by Dolopes, was reduced to slavery, and colonized by themselves.

1.98.3
623
πρὸς δὲ Καρυστίους αὐτοῖς ἄνευ τῶν ἄλλων Εὐβοέων πόλεμος ἐγένετο , καὶ χρόνῳ ξυνέβησαν καθ’ ὁμολογίαν .
They had a war also with the Carystians, without the rest of the Euboeans joining in it; and in course of time they surrendered on conditions.

1.98.4
624
Ναξίοις δὲ ἀποστᾶσι μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπολέμησαν καὶ πολιορκίᾳ παρεστήσαντο , πρώτη τε αὕτη πόλις ξυμμαχὶς παρὰ τὸ καθεστηκὸς ἐδουλώθη , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὡς ἑκάστῃ ξυνέβη .
With the Naxians, who had revolted, they afterwards waged war, and reduced them after a siege; and this was the first allied city that was subjugated contrary to the agreement; then the rest, as each happened.

1.99.1
625
αἰτίαι δὲ ἄλλαι τε ἦσαν τῶν ἀποστάσεων καὶ μέγισται αἱ τῶν φόρων καὶ νεῶν ἔκδειαι καὶ λιποστράτιον εἴ τῳ ἐγένετο ·
Now there were other reasons for the revolts, but the principal were arrears of tribute and ships, and failing (if any did so) in military service.

1.99.1
626
οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀκριβῶς ἔπρασσον καὶ λυπηροὶ ἦσαν οὐκ εἰωθόσιν οὐδὲ βουλομένοις ταλαιπωρεῖν προσάγοντες τὰς ἀνάγκας .
For the Athenians strictly exacted these things, and were offensive by using compulsion to men who were neither accustomed nor willing to do hard work.

1.99.2
627
ἦσαν δέ πως καὶ ἄλλως οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐκέτι ὁμοίως ἐν ἡδονῇ ἄρχοντες , καὶ οὔτε ξυνεστράτευον ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ῥᾴδιόν τε προσάγεσθαι ἦν αὐτοῖς τοὺς ἀφισταμένους .
In some other respects also they were no longer liked in their government, as they had been; and while they did not join in the service on an equal footing, at the same time it was easy for them to bring to subjection those who revolted.

1.99.3
628
ὧν αὐτοὶ αἴτιοι ἐγένοντο οἱ ξύμμαχοι ·
And for this the allies themselves were to blame;

1.99.3
629
διὰ γ

1.100.1
630
ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἡ ἐπ’ Εὐρυμέδοντι ποταμῷ ἐν Παμφυλίᾳ πεζομαχία καὶ ναυμαχία Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων πρὸς Μήδους , καὶ ἐνίκων τῇ αὐτῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀμφότερα Ἀθηναῖοι Κίμωνος τοῦ Μιλτιάδου στρατηγοῦντος , καὶ εἷλον τριήρεις Φοινίκων καὶ διέφθειραν τὰς πάσας ἐς διακοσίας .
After this was fought the battle at the river Eurymedon in Pamphylia, both by land and sea, between the Athenians and their allies and the Medes; and the Athenians were victorious in both engagements on the same day, under the command of Cimon, the son of Miltiades; and took and destroyed in all two hundred triremes of the Phoenicians.

1.100.2
631
χρόνῳ δὲ ὕστερον ξυνέβη Θασίους αὐτῶν ἀποστῆναι, διενεχθέντας περὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ ἀντιπέρας Θρᾴκῃ ἐμπορίων καὶ τοῦ μετάλλου ἃ ἐνέμοντο.
After some time, the Thasians revolted from them, having quarreled over the markets on the opposite coast of Thrace and the mine they were exploiting.

1.100.2
632
καὶ ναυσὶ μὲν ἐπὶ Θάσον πλεύσαντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ναυμαχίᾳ ἐκράτησαν καὶ ἐς τὴν γῆν ἀπέβησαν, ἐπὶ δὲ Στρυμόνα πέμψαντες μυρίους οἰκήτορας αὑτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὑπὸ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους ὡς οἰκιοῦντες τὰς τότε καλουμένας Ἐννέα ὁδούς, νῦν δὲ Ἀμφίπολιν, τῶν μὲν Ἐννέα ὁδῶν αὐτοὶ ἐκράτησαν, ἃς εἶχον Ἠδωνοί, προελθόντες δὲ τῆς Θρᾴκης ἐς μεσόγειαν διεφθάρησαν ἐν Δραβησκῷ τῇ Ἠδωνικῇ ὑπὸ τῶν Θρᾳκῶν ξυμπάντων, οἷς πολέμιον ἦν τὸ χωρίον αἱ Ἐννέα ὁδοὶ κτιζόμενον.
The Athenians sailed to Thasos with their fleet and won a naval battle. They landed on the island and, at the same time, sent ten thousand settlers to the region near the Strymon river to colonize what was then called the Nine Ways, now Amphipolis. They conquered the Nine Ways, held by the Edonians, but when they advanced inland into Thrace, they were destroyed at Drabescus in Edonian territory by the united Thracians, who were hostile to the settlement of the Nine Ways.

633
Θάσιοι δὲ νικηθέντες μάχῃ καὶ πολιορκούμενοι Λακεδαιμονίους ἐπεκαλοῦντο καὶ ἐπαμύνειν ἐκέλευον ἐσβαλόντας ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν.
The defeated Thasians, while under siege, appealed to the Lacedaemonians for assistance, urging them to invade Attica as a diversion.

1.101.2
634
οἱ δὲ ὑπέσχοντο μὲν κρ

1.101.2
635
πλεῖστοι δὲ τῶν Εἱλώτων ἐγένοντο οἱ τῶν παλαιῶν Μεσσηνίων τότε δουλωθέντων ἀπόγονοι·
Most of the Helots were descendants of the ancient Messenians who had been enslaved in earlier times.

1.101.2
636
ᾗ καὶ Μεσσήνιοι ἐκλήθησαν οἱ πάντες.
Thus, all these Helots were collectively known as Messenians.

1.101.3
637
πρὸς μὲν οὖν τοὺς ἐν Ἰθώμῃ πόλεμος καθειστήκει Λακεδαιμονίοις, Θάσιοι δὲ τρίτῳ ἔτει πολιορκούμενοι ὡμολόγησαν Ἀθηναίοις τεῖχός τε καθελόντες καὶ ναῦς παραδόντες, χρήματά τε ὅσα ἔδει ἀποδοῦναι αὐτίκα ταξάμενοι καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν φέρειν, τήν τε ἤπειρον καὶ τὸ μέταλλον ἀφέντες.
The Lacedaemonians were engaged in war with those in Ithome, while the Thasians, after three years of siege, agreed to terms with the Athenians. They demolished their walls, surrendered their ships, agreed to pay the immediate sum of money required, and to continue paying tribute. They also relinquished their control over the mainland and the mines.

1.102.1
638
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δέ, ὡς αὐτοῖς πρὸς τοὺς ἐν Ἰθώμῃ ἐμηκύνετο ὁ πόλεμος, ἄλλους τε ἐπεκαλέσαντο ξυμμάχους καὶ Ἀθηναίους·
The Lacedaemonians, as the war against those in Ithome became prolonged, called on other allies for support, including the Athenians.

1.102.1
639
οἱ δ’ ἦλθον Κίμωνος στρατηγοῦντος πλήθει οὐκ ὀλίγῳ.
The Athenians responded and came with a considerable force under the command of Cimon.

1.102.2
640
μάλιστα δ’ αὐτοὺς ἐπεκαλέσαντο ὅτι τειχομαχεῖν ἐδόκουν δυνατοὶ εἶναι , τοῖς δὲ πολιορκίας μακρᾶς καθεστηκυίας τούτου ἐνδεᾶ ἐφαίνετο ·
The Lacedaemonians especially summoned them because they were considered skilled in siege warfare, which seemed lacking in the protracted siege.

1.102.2
641
βίᾳ γὰρ ἂν εἷλον τὸ χωρίον .
For it was thought that the place could be taken by force.

1.102.3
642
καὶ διαφορὰ ἐκ ταύτης τῆς στρατείας πρῶτον Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις φανερὰ ἐγένετο .
From this campaign, the first apparent dispute between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians emerged.

1.102.3
643
οἱ γὰρ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ἐπειδὴ τὸ χωρίον βίᾳ οὐχ ἡλίσκετο , δείσαντες τῶν Ἀθηναίων τὸ τολμηρὸν καὶ τὴν νεωτεροποιίαν , καὶ ἀλλοφύλους ἅμα ἡγησάμενοι , μή τι , ἢν παραμείνωσιν , ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν Ἰθώμῃ πεισθέντες νεωτερίσωσι , μόνους τῶν ξυμμάχων ἀπέπεμψαν , τὴν μὲν ὑποψίαν οὐ δηλοῦντες , εἰπόντες δὲ ὅτι οὐδὲν προσδέονται αὐτῶν ἔτι .
The Lacedaemonians, failing to take the place by force and fearing the Athenians' boldness and innovation, dismissed them alone among the allies, not revealing their suspicions but stating they no longer needed their assistance.

1.102.4
644
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔγνωσαν οὐκ ἐπὶ τῷ βελτίονι λόγῳ ἀποπεμπόμενοι , ἀλλά τινος ὑπόπτου γενομένου , καὶ δεινὸν ποιησάμενοι καὶ οὐκ ἀξιώσαντες ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων τοῦτο παθεῖν , εὐθὺς ἐπειδὴ ἀνεχώρησαν , ἀφέντες τὴν γενομένην ἐπὶ τῷ Μήδῳ ξυμμαχίαν πρὸς αὐ

1.103.1
645
οἱ δ’ ἐν Ἰθώμῃ δεκάτῳ ἔτει , ὡς οὐκέτι ἐδύναντο ἀντέχειν , ξυνέβησαν πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἐφ’ ᾧ ἐξίασιν ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ὑπόσπονδοι καὶ μηδέποτε ἐπιβήσονται αὐτῆς ·
After ten years, those in Ithome, unable to hold out, capitulated to the Lacedaemonians on terms of leaving the Peloponnese under truce and never returning.

1.103.1
646
ἢν δέ τις ἁλίσκηται , τοῦ λαβόντος εἶναι δοῦλον .
Anyone caught returning was to be enslaved by the captor.

1.103.2
647
ἦν δέ τι καὶ χρηστήριον τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις Πυθικὸν πρὸ τοῦ , τὸν ἱκέτην τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ Ἰθωμήτα ἀφιέναι .
Previously, a Pythian oracle had advised the Lacedaemonians to release the suppliant of Zeus at Ithome.
The Athenians, motivated by their newfound animosity towards the Lacedaemonians, welcomed those who had left Ithome, settling them at Naupactus, which they had recently seized from the Ozolian Locrians.

1.103.3
648
ἐξῆλθον δὲ αὐτοὶ καὶ παῖδες καὶ γυναῖκες , καὶ αὐτοὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι δεξάμενοι κατ’ ἔχθος ἤδη τὸ Λακεδαιμονίων ἐς Ναύπακτον κατῴκισαν , ἣν ἔτυχον ᾑρηκότες νεωστὶ Λοκρῶν τῶν Ὀζολῶν ἐχόντων .
The people from Ithome, including men, women, and children, were received by the Athenians, who, now hostile to the Lacedaemonians, settled them at Naupactus, which they had recently conquered from the Ozolian Locrians.

1.103.4
649
προσεχώρησαν δὲ καὶ Μεγαρῆς Ἀθηναίοις ἐς ξυμμαχίαν Λακεδαιμονίων ἀποστάντες , ὅτι αὐτοὺς Κορίνθιοι περὶ γῆς ὅρων πολέμῳ κατεῖχον ·
The Megarians also allied with the Athenians after defecting from the Lacedaemonians, as they were under attack from the Corinthians regarding land boundaries.

1.103.4
650
καὶ ἔσχον Ἀθηναῖοι Μέγαρα καὶ Πηγάς , καὶ τὰ μακρὰ τείχη ᾠκοδόμησαν Μεγαρεῦσι τὰ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἐς Νίσαιαν καὶ ἐφρούρουν αὐτοί .
The Athenians then took control of Megara and Pegae, built the long walls from Megara to Nisaea, and manned them themselves.

1.103.4
651
καὶ Κορινθίοις μὲν οὐχ ἥκιστα ἀπὸ τοῦδε τὸ σφοδρὸν μῖσος ἤρξατο πρῶτον ἐς Ἀθηναίους γενέσθαι .
This action was the beginning of an intense hatred by the Corinthians towards the Athenians.

1.104.1
652
Ἰνάρως δὲ ὁ Ψαμμητίχου , Λίβυς , βασιλεὺς Λιβύων τῶν πρὸς Αἰγύπτῳ , ὁρμώμενος ἐκ Μαρείας τῆς ὑπὲρ Φάρου πόλεως ἀπέστησεν Αἰγύπτου τὰ πλείω ἀπὸ βασιλέως Ἀρταξέρξου , καὶ αὐτὸς ἄρχων γενόμενος Ἀθηναίους ἐπηγάγετο .
Inarus, son of Psammetichus, a Libyan and king of the Libyans near Egypt, starting from Mareia city beyond Pharos, caused most of Egypt to revolt from King Artaxerxes. Becoming a ruler himself, he called upon the Athenians for assistance.

1.104.2
653
οἱ δέ ( ἔτυχον γὰρ ἐς Κύπρον στρατευόμενοι ναυσὶ διακοσίαις αὑτῶν τε καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ) ἦλθον ἀπολιπόντες τὴν Κύπρον , καὶ ἀναπλεύσαντες ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἐς τὸν Νεῖλον τοῦ τε ποταμοῦ κρατοῦντες καὶ τῆς Μέμφιδος τῶν δύο μερῶν πρὸς τὸ τρίτον μέρος ὃ καλεῖται Λευκὸν τεῖχος ἐπολέμουν ·
The Athenians, who were campaigning in Cyprus with two hundred of their own and allied ships, left Cyprus. They sailed to the Nile, controlling the river and two-thirds of Memphis, and fought against the third division called the White Castle.

1.104.2
654
ἐνῆσαν δὲ αὐτόθι Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων οἱ καταφυγόντες καὶ Αἰγυπτίων οἱ μὴ ξυναποστάντες .
There, the Persians and Medes who had sought refuge, as well as the Egyptians who had not revolted, resisted the Athenians.

1.105.1
655
Ἀθηναίοις δὲ ναυσὶν ἀποβᾶσιν ἐς Ἁλιᾶς πρὸς Κορινθίους καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίους μάχη ἐγένετο , καὶ ἐνίκων Κορίνθιοι .
The Athenians, having disembarked at Haliae, fought a battle against the Corinthians and Epidaurians, with the Corinthians emerging victorious.

1.105.1
656
καὶ ὕστερον Ἀθηναῖοι ἐναυμάχησαν ἐπὶ Κεκρυφαλείᾳ Πελοποννησίων ναυσί , καὶ ἐνίκων Ἀθηναῖοι .
Later, the Athenians fought a naval battle against the Peloponnesian fleet near Cecryphalea and won.

1.105.2
657
πολέμου δὲ καταστάντος πρὸς Αἰγινήτας Ἀθηναίοις μετὰ ταῦτα ναυμαχία γίγνεται ἐπ’ Αἰγίνῃ μεγάλη Ἀθηναίων καὶ Αἰγινητῶν , καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἑκατέροις παρῆσαν , καὶ ἐνίκων Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ ναῦς ἑβδομήκοντα λαβόντες αὐτῶν ἐς τὴν γῆν ἀπέβησαν καὶ ἐπολιόρκουν , Λεωκράτους τοῦ Στροίβου στρατηγοῦντος .
After this, a war broke out between the Athenians and the Aeginetans. A significant naval battle ensued off the coast of Aegina, with both sides receiving support from their allies. The Athenians emerged victorious, capturing seventy of their ships. Following their victory at sea, the Athenians landed and laid siege to Aegina, led by Leocrates, the son of Stroebus.

1.105.3
658
ἔπειτα Πελοποννήσιοι ἀμύνειν βουλόμενοι Αἰγινήταις ἐς μὲν τὴν Αἴγιναν τριακοσίους ὁπλίτας πρότερον Κορινθίων καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίων ἐπικούρους διεβίβασαν , τὰ δὲ ἄκρα τῆς Γερανείας κατέλαβον καὶ ἐς τὴν Μεγαρίδα κατέβησαν Κορίνθιοι μετὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων , νομίζοντες ἀδυνάτους ἔσεσθαι Ἀθηναίους βοηθεῖν τοῖς Μεγαρεῦσιν ἔν τε Αἰγίνῃ ἀπούσης στρατιᾶς πολλῆς καὶ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ·
Subsequently, the Peloponnesians, aiming to assist the Aeginetans, ferried three hundred hoplites, primarily from Corinth and Epidaurus, to Aegina. Additionally, they occupied the heights of Geranea and descended into Megarid, believing that the Athenians, with their forces divided between Aegina and Egypt, would be unable to aid the Megareans.

1.105.3
659
ἢν δὲ καὶ βοηθῶσιν , ἀπ’ Αἰγίνης ἀναστήσεσθαι αὐτούς .
They speculated that even if the Athenians did come to Megara's aid, this would force them to lift the siege of Aegina.

1.105.4
660
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸ μὲν πρὸς Αἰγίνῃ στράτευμα οὐκ ἐκίνησαν , τῶν δ’ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὑπολοίπων οἵ τε πρεσβύτατοι καὶ οἱ νεώτατοι ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς τὰ Μέγαρα Μυρωνίδου στρατηγοῦντος .
The Athenians did not move the army that was at Aegina but sent the oldest and the youngest of those who had remained in the city to Megara under the command of Myronides.

1.105.5
661
καὶ μάχης γενομένης ἰσορρόπου πρὸς Κορινθίους διεκρίθησαν ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων , καὶ ἐνόμισαν αὐτοὶ ἑκάτεροι οὐκ ἔλασσον ἔχειν ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ .
After an evenly matched battle with the Corinthians, they separated from each other, with both sides believing they had not fared worse in the engagement.

1.105.6
662
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἐκράτησαν γὰρ ὅμως μᾶλλον ) ἀπελθόντων τῶν Κορινθίων τροπαῖον ἔστησαν ·
The Athenians, having gained a slight advantage, erected a trophy after the Corinthians departed.

1.105.6
663
οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι κακιζόμενοι ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει πρεσβυτέρων καὶ παρασκευασάμενοι , ἡμέραις ὕστερον δώδεκα μάλιστα ἐλθόντες ἀνθίστασαν τροπαῖον καὶ αὐτοὶ ὡς νικήσαντες .
Chastised by the elders in their city, the Corinthians, after making preparations, returned twelve days later and erected their own trophy, claiming victory.

1.105.6
664
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐκβοηθήσαντες ἐκ τῶν Μεγάρων τούς τε τὸ τροπαῖον ἱστάντας διαφθείρουσι καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ξυμβαλόντες ἐκράτησαν .
The Athenians, coming to the aid of Megara, destroyed those Corinthians erecting the trophy and defeated the others in the ensuing clash.

1.106.1
665
οἱ δὲ νικώμενοι ὑπεχώρουν , καί τι αὐτῶν μέρος οὐκ ὀλίγον προσβιασθὲν καὶ διαμαρτὸν τῆς ὁδοῦ ἐσέπεσεν ἔς του χωρίον ἰδιώτου , ᾧ ἔτυχεν ὄρυγμα μέγα περιεῖργον καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἔξοδος .
The defeated Corinthians retreated, and a considerable number of them, forced off their path, fell into a large, enclosed trench belonging to a private landowner, with no exit.

1.106.2
666
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι γνόντες κατὰ πρόσωπόν τε εἶργον τοῖς ὁπλίταις καὶ περιστήσαντες κύκλῳ τοὺς ψιλοὺς κατέλευσαν πάντας τοὺς ἐσελθόντας , καὶ πάθος μέγα τοῦτο Κορινθίοις ἐγένετο .
The Athenians, realizing the situation, blockaded the trench with hoplites and surrounded it with light-armed troops, killing all the Corinthians who had fallen into it. This was a significant loss for the Corinthians.

1.106.2
667
τὸ δὲ πλῆθος ἀπεχώρησεν αὐτοῖς τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The main Corinthian force then retreated back to their home.

1.107.1
668
ἤρξαντο δὲ κατὰ τοὺς χρόνους τούτους καὶ τὰ μακρὰ τείχη Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς θάλασσαν οἰκοδομεῖν , τό τε Φαληρόνδε καὶ τὸ ἐς Πειραιᾶ .
Around this time, the Athenians also began constructing the long walls extending to the sea, leading to both Phaleron and Piraeus.

1.107.2
669
καὶ Φωκέων στρατευσάντων ἐς Δωριᾶς τὴν Λακεδαιμονίων μητρόπολιν , Βοιὸν καὶ Κυτίνιον καὶ Ἐρινεόν , καὶ ἑλόντων ἓν τῶν πολισμάτων τούτων , οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι Νικομήδους τοῦ Κλεομβρότου ὑπὲρ Πλειστοάνακτος τοῦ Παυσανίου βασιλέως νέου ὄντος ἔτι ἡγουμένου ἐβοήθησαν τοῖς Δωριεῦσιν ἑαυτῶν τε πεντακοσίοις καὶ χιλίοις ὁπλίταις καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων μυρίοις , καὶ τοὺς Φωκέας ὁμολογίᾳ ἀναγκάσαντες ἀποδοῦναι τὴν πόλιν ἀπεχώρουν πάλιν .
After the Phocians marched against Doris, the mother-country of the Lacedaemonians, which included the towns of Boeum, Cytinium, and Erineum, and captured one of these towns, the Lacedaemonians came to the aid of the Dorians. Led by Nicomedes, the son of Cleombrotus, on behalf of the young king Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, the Lacedaemonians, with 500 of their own hoplites and 10,000 from their allies, forced the Phocians to surrender the town under certain conditions and then retreated.

1.107.3
670
καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν μὲν αὐτούς , διὰ τοῦ Κρισαίου κόλπου εἰ βούλοιντο περαιοῦσθαι , Ἀθηναῖοι ναυσὶ περιπλεύσαντες ἔμελλον κωλύσειν ·
The Athenians prepared to prevent them from crossing the Crisaean Gulf by sea, planning to block their passage with ships.

1.107.3
671
διὰ δὲ τῆς Γερανείας οὐκ ἀσφαλὲς αὐτοῖς ἐφαίνετο Ἀθηναίων ἐχόντων Μέγαρα καὶ Πηγὰς πορεύεσθαι .
It also appeared unsafe for them to travel through Geraneia, as the Athenians held Megara and Pegae.

1.107.3
672
δύσοδός τε γὰρ ἡ Γερανεία καὶ ἐφρουρεῖτο αἰεὶ ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων , καὶ τότε ᾐσθάνοντο αὐτοὺς μέλλοντας καὶ ταύτῃ κωλύσειν .
Geraneia was a difficult route and always guarded by the Athenians, who were expected to block this path as well.

1.107.4
673
ἔδοξε δ’ αὐτοῖς ἐν Βοιωτοῖς περιμείνασι σκέψασθαι ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἀσφαλέστατα διαπορεύσονται .
So, the Lacedaemonians decided to wait in Boeotia to figure out the safest way to pass.

1.107.4
674
τὸ δέ τι καὶ ἄνδρες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπῆγον αὐτοὺς κρύφα , ἐλπίσαντες δῆμόν τε καταπαύσειν καὶ τὰ μακρὰ τείχη οἰκοδομούμενα .
Some Athenian men also secretly encouraged the Lacedaemonians, hoping to put an end to the democracy and the construction of the long walls.

1.107.5
675
ἐβοήθησαν δὲ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι πανδημεὶ καὶ Ἀργείων χίλιοι καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων ὡς ἕκαστοι ·

1.107.5
676
ξύμπαντες δὲ ἐγένοντο τετρακισχίλιοι καὶ μύριοι .
The Athenians responded en masse, along with a thousand Argives and various contingents from other allies, totaling 14,000 troops.

1.107.6
677
νομίσαντες δὲ ἀπορεῖν ὅπῃ διέλθωσιν ἐπεστράτευσαν αὐτοῖς , καί τι καὶ τοῦ δήμου καταλύσεως ὑποψίᾳ .
Believing the Lacedaemonians to be unsure of how to proceed, and suspecting an attempt to overthrow the democracy, they marched against them.

1.107.7
678
ἦλθον δὲ καὶ Θεσσαλῶν ἱππῆς τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις κατὰ τὸ ξυμμαχικόν , οἳ μετέστησαν ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ παρὰ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους .
The Thessalian cavalry also joined the Athenians as per their alliance, but they switched sides to the Lacedaemonians during the conflict.

1.108.1
679
γενομένης δὲ μάχης ἐν Τανάγρᾳ τῆς Βοιωτίας ἐνίκων Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι , καὶ φόνος ἐγένετο ἀμφοτέρων πολύς .
After a battle at Tanagra in Boeotia, the Lacedaemonians and their allies emerged victorious, although there was substantial loss of life on both sides.

1.108.2
680
καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι μὲν ἐς τὴν Μεγαρίδα ἐλθόντες καὶ δενδροτομήσαντες πάλιν ἀπῆλθον ἐπ’ οἴκου διὰ Γερανείας καὶ Ἰσθμοῦ ·
The Lacedaemonians, after entering Megarid and cutting down trees, returned home via Geraneia and the Isthmus.

1.108.2
681
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ δευτέρᾳ καὶ ἑξηκοστῇ ἡμέρᾳ μετὰ τὴν μάχην ἐστράτευσαν ἐς Βοιωτοὺς Μυρωνίδου στρατηγοῦντος , καὶ μάχῃ ἐν Οἰνοφύτοις τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς νικήσαντες τῆς τε χώρας ἐκράτησαν τῆς Βοιωτίας καὶ Φωκίδος καὶ Ταναγραίων τὸ τεῖχος περιεῖλον καὶ Λοκρῶν τῶν Ὀπουντίων ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας ὁμήρους τοὺς πλουσιωτάτους ἔλαβον , τά τε τείχη ἑαυτῶν τὰ μακρὰ ἀπετέλεσαν .
62
days after the battle, the Athenians, led by Myronides, marched against the Boeotians and, after winning a battle at Oenophyta, gained control of Boeotia, Phocis, and the Tanagraean wall. They also took a hundred of the wealthiest men from the Opuntian Locrians as hostages and completed their long walls.

1.108.4
682
ὡμολόγησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Αἰγινῆται μετὰ ταῦτα τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , τείχη τε περιελόντες καὶ ναῦς παραδόντες φόρον τε ταξάμενοι ἐς τὸν ἔπειτα χρόνον .
Subsequently, the Aeginetans also surrendered to the Athenians, dismantling their walls, handing over their ships, and agreeing to pay tribute in the future.

1.108.5
683
καὶ Πελοπόννησον περιέπλευσαν Ἀθηναῖοι Τολμίδου τοῦ Τολμαίου στρατηγοῦντος , καὶ τὸ νεώριον τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἐνέπρησαν καὶ Χαλκίδα Κορινθίων πόλιν εἷλον καὶ Σικυωνίους ἐν ἀποβάσει τῆς γῆς μάχῃ ἐκράτησαν .
Under the command of Tolmides, the son of Tolmaeus, the Athenians circumnavigated the Peloponnese, burned the Lacedaemonian arsenal, captured the Corinthian city of Chalcis, and defeated the Sicyonians in a battle during a land incursion.

1.109.1
684
οἱ δ’ ἐν τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐπέμενον , καὶ αὐτοῖς πολλαὶ ἰδέαι πολέμων κατέστησαν .
The Athenians and their allies in Egypt continued their stay, engaging in various forms of warfare.

1.109.2
685
τὸ μὲν γὰρ πρῶτον ἐκράτουν τῆς Αἰγύπτου οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , καὶ βασιλεὺς πέμπει ἐς Λακεδαίμονα Μεγάβαζον ἄνδρα Πέρσην χρήματα ἔχοντα , ὅπως ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐσβαλεῖν πεισθέντων τῶν Πελοποννησίων ἀπ’ Αἰγύπτου ἀπαγάγοι Ἀθηναίους .
Initially, the Athenians controlled Egypt. The Persian king sent Megabazus, a Persian man with funds, to Lacedaemon to persuade the Peloponnesians to invade Attica, thereby drawing the Athenians away from Egypt.

1.109.3
686
ὡς δὲ αὐτῷ οὐ προυχώρει καὶ τὰ χρήματα ἄλλως ἀνηλοῦτο , ὁ μὲν Μεγάβαζος καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν χρημάτων πάλιν ἐς τὴν Ἀσίαν ἀνεκομίσθη , Μεγάβυζον δὲ τὸν Ζωπύρου πέμπει ἄνδρα Πέρσην μετὰ στρατιᾶς πολλῆς ·
As Megabazus's efforts were unsuccessful and the money was being spent in vain, he and the remaining funds were sent back to Asia. The Persian king then dispatched Megabyzus, son of Zopyrus, with a large army.

1.109.4
687
ὃς ἀφικόμενος κατὰ γῆν τούς τε Αἰγυπτίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους μάχῃ ἐκράτησε καὶ ἐκ τῆς Μέμφιδος ἐξήλασε τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ τέλος ἐς Προσωπίτιδα τὴν νῆσον κατέκλῃσε καὶ ἐπολιόρκει ἐν αὐτῇ ἐνιαυτὸν καὶ ἓξ μῆνας , μέχρι οὗ ξηράνας τὴν διώρυχα καὶ παρατρέψας ἄλλῃ τὸ ὕδωρ τάς τε ναῦς ἐπὶ τοῦ ξηροῦ ἐποίησε καὶ τῆς νήσου τὰ πολλὰ ἤπειρον , καὶ διαβὰς εἷλε τὴν νῆσον πεζῇ .
Upon arrival, Megabyzus defeated the Egyptians and their allies in battle, drove the Greeks out of Memphis, and ultimately trapped them on the island of Prosopitis, besieging them there for a year and six months. He drained the canal and diverted the water, rendering the Greek ships stranded on dry land and turning much of the island into mainland. He then crossed over on foot and captured the island.

1.110.1
688
οὕτω μὲν τὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων πράγματα ἐφθάρη ἓξ ἔτη πολεμήσαντα ·
Thus, the Greek affairs in Egypt were destroyed after a six-year conflict.

1.110.1
689
καὶ ὀλίγοι ἀπὸ πολλῶν πορευόμενοι διὰ τῆς Λιβύης ἐς Κυρήνην ἐσώθησαν , οἱ δὲ πλεῖστοι ἀπώλοντο .
Only a few of many managed to escape through Libya to Cyrene; most perished.

1.110.2
690
Αἴγυπτος δὲ πάλιν ὑπὸ βασιλέα ἐγένετο πλὴν Ἀμυρταίου τοῦ ἐν τοῖς ἕλεσι βασιλέως ·
Egypt came back under the control of the Persian king, except for Amyrtaeus, who reigned in the marshes.

1.110.2
691
τοῦτον δὲ διὰ μέγεθός τε τοῦ ἕλους οὐκ ἐδύναντο ἑλεῖν , καὶ ἅμα μαχιμώτατοί εἰσι τῶν Αἰγυπτίων οἱ ἕλειοι .
They could not capture him due to the vastness of the marshes, and the marsh-dwellers were the most warlike of the Egyptians.

1.110.3
692
Ἰνάρως δὲ ὁ Λιβύων βασιλεύς , ὃς τὰ πάντα ἔπραξε περὶ τῆς Αἰγύπτου , προδοσίᾳ ληφθεὶς ἀνεσταυρώθη .
Inarus, the Libyan king who had instigated the entire affair regarding Egypt, was captured by betrayal and crucified.

1.110.4
693
ἐκ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν καὶ τῆς ἄλλης ξυμμαχίδος πεντήκοντα τριήρεις διάδοχοι πλέουσαι ἐς Αἴγυπτον ἔσχον κατὰ τὸ Μενδήσιον κέρας, οὐκ εἰδότες τῶν γεγονότων οὐδέν·
Moreover, fifty triremes that were sailing to Egypt from Athens and the rest of the confederacy to relieve their former force, put in to shore at the Mendesian branch, knowing nothing of what had happened.

1.110.4
694
καὶ αὐτοῖς ἔκ τε γῆς ἐπιπεσόντες πεζοὶ καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης Φοινίκων ναυτικὸν διέφθειραν τὰς πολλὰς τῶν νεῶν, αἱ δ’ ἐλάσσους διέφυγον πάλιν.
and the land forces falling on them from the shore, and the fleet of the Phoenicians by sea, destroyed the greater part of the ships: the smaller part escaped back.

1.110.4
695
τὰ μὲν κατὰ τὴν μεγάλην στρατείαν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐς Αἴγυπτον οὕτως ἐτελεύτησεν.
Thus ended the great expedition of the Athenians and their allies to Egypt.

1.111.1
696
ἐκ δὲ Θεσσαλίας Ὀρέστης ὁ Ἐχεκρατίδου υἱὸς τοῦ Θεσσαλῶν βασιλέως φεύγων ἔπεισεν Ἀθηναίους ἑαυτὸν κατάγειν·
Now Orestes, son of Echecratidas, king of the Thessalians, being banished from Thessaly, persuaded the Athenians to restore him:

1.111.1
697
καὶ παραλαβόντες Βοιωτοὺς καὶ Φωκέας ὄντας ξυμμάχους οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐστράτευσαν τῆς Θεσσαλίας ἐπὶ Φάρσαλον.
and taking with them the Boeotians and Phocians, who were their allies, the Athenians marched against Pharsalus in Thessaly.

1.111.1
698
καὶ τῆς μὲν γῆς ἐκράτουν ὅσα μὴ προϊόντες πολὺ ἐκ τῶν ὅπλων (οἱ γὰρ ἱππῆς τῶν Θεσσαλῶν εἶργον), τὴν δὲ πόλιν οὐχ εἷλον, οὐδ’ ἄλλο προυχώρει αὐτοῖς οὐδὲν ὧ

1.111.2
699
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον χίλιοι Ἀθηναίων ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς τὰς ἐν Πηγαῖς ἐπιβάντες (εἶχον δ’ αὐτοὶ τὰς Πηγάς) παρέπλευσαν ἐς Σικυῶνα Περικλέους τοῦ Ξανθίππου στρατηγοῦντος, καὶ ἀποβάντες Σικυωνίων τοὺς προσμείξαντας μάχῃ ἐκράτησαν.
Not long after this, one thousand Athenians having embarked in the ships that were at Pegae, (for they were themselves in possession of that port,) coasted along to Sicyon, under the command of Pericles, son of Xanthippus, and landed, and defeated those of the Sicyonians who met them in battle.

1.111.3
700
καὶ εὐθὺς παραλαβόντες Ἀχαιοὺς καὶ διαπλεύσαντες πέραν τῆς Ἀκαρνανίας ἐς Οἰνιάδας ἐστράτευσαν καὶ ἐπολιόρκουν, οὐ μέντοι εἷλόν γε, ἀλλ’ ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου.
And immediately taking with them the Achaeans, and sailing across, they turned their arms against Oeniadae in Acarnania, and besieged it: they did not, however, take it, but returned home.

1.112.1
701
ὕστερον δὲ διαλιπόντων ἐτῶν τριῶν σπονδαὶ γίγνονται Πελοποννησίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις πεντέτεις.
Subsequently, after an interval of three years, a truce for five years was made between the Peloponnesians and Athenians.

1.112.2
702
καὶ Ἑλληνικοῦ μὲν πολέμου ἔσχον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι, ἐς δὲ Κύπρον ἐστρατεύοντο ναυσὶ διακοσίαις αὑτῶν τε καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων Κίμωνος στρατηγοῦντος.
So the Athenians ceased from prosecuting the war in Greece, but made an expedition against Cyprus with two hundred ships of their own and of the allies, under the command of Cimon.

1.112.3
703
καὶ ἑξήκοντα μὲν νῆες ἐς Αἴγυπτον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἔπλευσαν, Ἀμυρταίου μεταπέμποντος τοῦ ἐν τοῖς ἕλεσι βασιλέως,
sixty of which sailed from them to Egypt, being sent for by Amyrtaeus, the king in the marshes;

1.112.4
704
αἱ δὲ ἄλλαι Κίτιον ἐπολιόρκουν. Κίμωνος δὲ ἀποθανόντος καὶ λιμοῦ γενομένου ἀπεχώρησαν ἀπὸ Κιτίου, καὶ πλεύσαντες ὑπὲρ Σαλαμῖνος τῆς ἐν Κύπρῳ Φοίνιξι καὶ Κυπρίοις καὶ Κίλιξιν ἐναυμάχησαν καὶ ἐπεζομάχησαν ἅμα, καὶ νικήσαντες ἀμφότερα ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου καὶ αἱ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου νῆες πάλιν αἱ ἐλθοῦσαι μετ’ αὐτῶν.
while the rest besieged Citium. Cimon having died, and there being a dearth of provisions, they retired from Citium; and while sailing off Salamis in Cyprus, they fought both by sea and land at the same time with the Phoenicians and Cilicians; and having conquered in both engagements, returned home, and with them the ships that had come back from Egypt.

1.112.5
705
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα τὸν ἱερὸν καλούμενον πόλεμον ἐστράτευσαν, καὶ κρατήσαντες τοῦ ἐν Δελφοῖς ἱεροῦ παρέδοσαν Δελφοῖς·
After this, the Lacedaemonians waged what is called the sacred war, and having taken possession of the temple at Delphi, gave it up to the Delphians:

1.112.5
706
καὶ αὖθις ὕστερον Ἀθηναῖοι ἀποχωρησάντων αὐτῶν στρατεύσαντες καὶ κρατήσαντες παρέδοσαν Φωκεῦσιν.
and the Athenians again afterwards, on their retiring, marched and took possession of it, and restored it to the Phocians.

1.113.1
707
καὶ χρόνου ἐγγενομένου μετὰ ταῦτα Ἀθηναῖοι, Βοιωτῶν τῶν φευγόντων ἐχόντων Ὀρχομενὸν καὶ Χαιρώνειαν καὶ ἄλλ’ ἄττα χωρία τῆς Βοιωτίας, ἐστράτευσαν ἑαυτῶν μὲν χιλίοις ὁπλίταις, τῶν δὲ ξυμμάχων ὡς ἑκάστοις ἐπὶ τὰ χωρία ταῦτα πολέμια ὄντα, Τολμίδου τοῦ Τολμαίου στρατηγοῦντος.
Some time having elapsed after these things, the Boeotian exiles being in possession of Orchomenus, Chaeronea, and some other places in Boeotia, the Athenians, under the command of Tolmides, son of Tolmaeus, marched with one thousand heavy-armed of their own and the several contingents of the allies, against these places; for they were hostile to them.

1.113.1
708
καὶ Χαιρώνειαν ἑλόντες καὶ ἀνδραποδίσαντες ἀπεχώρουν φυλακὴν καταστήσαντες.
Having taken Chaeronea, [and reduced it to slavery,] they were retiring, after placing a garrison in it.

1.113.2
709
πορευομένοις δ’ αὐτοῖς ἐν Κορωνείᾳ ἐπιτίθενται οἵ τε ἐκ τῆς Ὀρχομενοῦ φυγάδες Βοιωτῶν καὶ Λοκροὶ μετ’ αὐτῶν καὶ Εὐβοέων φυγάδες καὶ ὅσοι τῆς αὐτῆς γνώμης ἦσαν, καὶ μάχῃ κρατήσαντες τοὺς μὲν διέφθειραν τῶν Ἀθηναίων, τοὺς δὲ ζῶντας ἔλαβον.
But as they were on their march, the Boeotian exiles from Orchomenus, and with them some Locrians and exiles of the Euboeans, and all that were of the same views, attacked them at Coronea, and, having defeated them in battle, slew some of the Athenians, and took others of them alive.

1.113.3
710
καὶ τὴν Βοιωτίαν ἐξέλιπον Ἀθηναῖοι πᾶσαν, σπονδὰς ποιησάμενοι ἐφ’ ᾧ τοὺς ἄνδρας κομιοῦνται.
So the Athenians evacuated all Boeotia, having made peace on condition of recovering their men.

1.113.4
711
καὶ οἱ φεύγοντες Βοιωτῶν κατελθόντες καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι πάντες αὐτόνομοι πάλιν ἐγένοντο.
And the exiles of the Boeotians were restored, and they and all the rest became independent again.

1.114.1
712
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον Εὔβοια ἀπέστη ἀπὸ Ἀθηναίων, καὶ ἐς αὐτὴν διαβεβηκότος ἤδη Περικλέους στρατιᾷ Ἀθηναίων ἠγγέλθη αὐτῷ ὅτι Μέγαρα ἀφέστηκε καὶ Πελοποννήσιοι μέλλουσιν ἐσβαλεῖν ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν καὶ οἱ φρουροὶ Ἀθηναίων διεφθαρμένοι εἰσὶν ὑπὸ Μεγαρέων, πλὴν ὅσοι ἐς Νίσαιαν ἀπέφυγον.
Not long after this, Euboea revolted from the Athenians; and when Pericles had already crossed over to it with an army of Athenians, news was brought him that Megara had revolted; that the Peloponnesians were on the point of invading Attica; and that the Athenian garrison had been put to the sword by the Megareans, except as many as had escaped to Nisaea.

1.114.1
713
ἐπαγαγόμενοι δὲ Κορινθίους καὶ Σικυωνίους καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίους ἀπέστησαν οἱ Μεγαρῆς.
Now the Megareans had revolted, after calling to their aid the Corinthians, and Sicyonians, and Epidaurians.

1.114.1
714
ὁ δὲ Περικλῆς πάλιν κατὰ τάχος ἐκόμιζε τὴν στρατιὰν ἐκ τῆς Εὐβοίας.
So Pericles took the army back from Euboea as quickly as possible.

1.114.2
715
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἐς Ἐλευσῖνα καὶ Θριῶζε ἐσβαλόντες ἐδῄωσαν Πλειστοάνακτος τοῦ Παυσανίου βασιλέως Λακεδαιμονίων ἡγουμένου, καὶ τὸ πλέον οὐκέτι προελθόντες ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου.
After this the Peloponnesians made an incursion as far as Eleusis and Thrium, and ravaged the country, under the command of Pleistoanax, the son of Pausanias, king of the Lacedaemonians; and without advancing any farther they returned home.

1.114.3
716
καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι πάλιν ἐς Εὔβοιαν διαβάντες Περικλέους στρατηγοῦντος κατεστρέψαντο πᾶσαν, καὶ τὴν μὲν ἄλλην ὁμολογίᾳ κατεστήσαντο, Ἑστιαιᾶς δὲ ἐξοικίσαντες αὐτοὶ τὴν γῆν ἔσχον.
And the Athenians having again crossed over to Euboea under the command of Pericles, subdued the whole of it, and settled the rest of the island by treaty; but the Histiaeans they expelled from their homes, and held the territory themselves.

1.115.1
717
ἀναχωρήσαντες δὲ ἀπ’ Εὐβοίας οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον σπονδὰς ἐποιήσαντο πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους τριακοντούτεις, ἀποδόντες Νίσαιαν καὶ Πηγὰς καὶ Τροιζῆνα καὶ Ἀχαΐαν.
Having returned from Euboea, not long after they made a truce with the Lacedaemonians and their allies for thirty years, giving back Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, Achaia;

1.115.1
718
ταῦτα γὰρ εἶχον Ἀθηναῖοι Πελοποννησίων.
for of these places in the Peloponnese the Athenians were in possession.

1.115.2
719
ἕκτῳ δὲ ἔτει Σαμίοις καὶ Μιλησίοις πόλεμος ἐγένετο περὶ Πριήνης , καὶ οἱ Μιλήσιοι ἐλασσούμενοι τῷ πολέμῳ παρ’ Ἀθηναίους ἐλθόντες κατεβόων τῶν Σαμίων .
Now in the sixth year a war broke out between the Samians and Milesians about Priene; and the Milesians being worsted in the war went to the Athenians, and raised an outcry against the Samians;

1.115.2
720
ξυνεπελάβοντο δὲ καὶ ἐξ αὐτῆς τῆς Σάμου ἄνδρες ἰδιῶται νεωτερίσαι βουλόμενοι τὴν πολιτείαν .
some private individuals from Samos itself taking part with them, from a wish to effect a revolution in the government.

1.115.3
721
πλεύσαντες οὖν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς Σάμον ναυσὶ τεσσαράκοντα δημοκρατίαν κατέστησαν, καὶ ὁμήρους ἔλαβον τῶν Σαμίων πεντήκοντα μὲν παῖδας, ἴσους δὲ ἄνδρας, καὶ κατέθεντο ἐς Λῆμνον, καὶ φρουρὰν ἐγκαταλιπόντες ἀνεχώρησαν.
The Athenians therefore sailed to Samos with forty ships, and established a democracy; and taking as hostages from the Samians fifty boys and as many men, deposited them in Lemnos, and after leaving a garrison in the island, withdrew.

1.115.4
722
τῶν δὲ Σαμίων ἦσαν γάρ τινες οἳ οὐχ ὑπέμειναν, ἀλλ’ ἔφυγον ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον, ξυνθέμενοι τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει τοῖς δυνατωτάτοις καὶ Πισσούθνῃ τῷ Ὑστάσπου ξυμμαχίαν, ὃς εἶχε Σάρδεις τότε, ἐπικούρους τε ξυλλέξαντες ἐς ἑπτακοσίους διέβησαν ὑπὸ νύκτα ἐς τὴν Σάμον, καὶ πρῶτον μὲν τῷ δήμῳ ἐπανέστησαν καὶ ἐκράτησαν τῶν πλείστων, ἔπειτα τοὺς ὁμήρους ἐκκλέψαντες ἐκ Λήμνου τοὺς αὑτῶν ἀπέστησαν, καὶ τοὺς φρουροὺς τοὺς Ἀθηναίων καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας οἳ ἦσαν παρὰ σφίσιν ἐξέδοσαν Πισσούθνῃ, ἐπί τε Μίλητον εὐθὺς παρεσκευάζοντο στρατεύειν.
But the exiles of the Samians (for there were some who did not remain in the island, but fled to the continent) having made arrangements with the most powerful of those in the city, and an alliance with Pisuthnes, the son of Hystaspes, who had the satrapy of Sardis at that time, and having collected auxiliaries to the number of seven hundred, crossed over to Samos towards night, and in the first place rose up against the commons, and secured most of them; then, having secretly removed their hostages from Lemnos, they revolted, and gave up to Pisuthnes the garrison and its commanders that were with them, and immediately prepared to go against Miletus.

1.115.5
723
ξυναπέστησα

1.116.1
724
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ὡς ᾔσθοντο, πλεύσαντες ναυσὶν ἑξήκοντα ἐπὶ Σάμου ταῖς μὲν ἑκκαίδεκα τῶν νεῶν οὐκ ἐχρήσαντο (ἔτυχον γὰρ αἱ μὲν ἐπὶ Καρίας ἐς προσκοπὴν τῶν Φοινισσῶν νεῶν οἰχόμεναι, αἱ δὲ ἐπὶ Χίου καὶ Λέσβου περιαγγέλλουσαι βοηθεῖν), τεσσαράκοντα δὲ ναυσὶ καὶ τέσσαρσι Περικλέους δεκάτου αὐτοῦ στρατηγοῦντος ἐναυμάχησαν πρὸς Τραγίᾳ τῇ νήσῳ Σαμίων ναυσὶν ἑβδομήκοντα, ὧν ἦσαν αἱ εἴκοσι στρατιώτιδες (ἔτυχον δὲ αἱ πᾶσαι ἀπὸ Μιλήτου πλέουσαι), καὶ ἐνίκων Ἀθηναῖοι.
The Athenians, when they were aware of it, sailed with sixty ships for Samos, but did not use sixteen of them (for some were gone towards Caria to look out for the Phoenician fleet; others towards Chios and Lesbos, carrying about orders to bring reinforcements); with forty-four, however, under the command of Pericles and nine others, they fought a battle near the island of Tragia with seventy ships of the Samians, twenty of which were transports, (they all happened to be sailing from Miletus,) and the Athenians were victorious.

1.116.2
725
ὕστερον δὲ αὐτοῖς ἐβοήθησαν ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν νῆες τεσσαράκοντα καὶ Χίων καὶ Λεσβίων πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι, καὶ ἀποβάντες καὶ κρατοῦντες τῷ πεζῷ ἐπολιόρκουν τρισὶ τείχεσι τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ἅμα.
Afterwards there came to them a reinforcement of forty ships from Athens, and five and twenty from Chios and Lesbos; and when they had disembarked, and had the superiority in land forces, they invested the city with three walls, and blockaded it by sea at the same time.

1.116.3
726
Περικλῆς δὲ λαβὼν ἑξήκοντα ναῦς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐφορμουσῶν ᾤχετο κατὰ τάχος ἐπὶ Καύνου καὶ Καρίας , ἐσαγγελθέντων ὅτι Φοίνισσαι νῆες ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς πλέουσιν ·
Then Pericles took sixty ships of the blockading squadron, and went as quickly as possible in the direction of Caunus and Caria, news having been brought that the Phoenician fleet was sailing against them:

1.116.3
727
ᾤχετο γὰρ καὶ ἐκ τῆς Σάμου πέντε ναυσὶ Στησαγόρας καὶ ἄλλοι ἐπὶ τὰς Φοινίσσας .
for there had also gone from Samos Stesagoras and some others with five ships to fetch those of the Phoenicians.

1.117.1
728
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ οἱ Σάμιοι ἐξαπιναίως ἔκπλουν ποιησάμενοι ἀφάρκτῳ τῷ στρατοπέδῳ ἐπιπεσόντες τάς τε προφυλακίδας ναῦς διέφθειραν καὶ ναυμαχοῦντες τὰς ἀνταναγομένας ἐνίκησαν , καὶ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς ἐκράτησαν ἡμέρας περὶ τέσσαρας καὶ δέκα , καὶ ἐσεκομίσαντο καὶ ἐξεκομίσαντο ἃ ἐβούλοντο .
At this time the Samians, having suddenly sallied out, fell on the unprotected camp, and destroyed the guard-ships, and in a sea-fight defeated those that put out against them, and were masters of the sea along their coasts about fourteen days, carrying in and out what they pleased.

1.117.2
729
ἐλθόντος δὲ Περικλέους πάλιν ταῖς ναυσὶ κατεκλῄσθησαν .
But on the arrival of Pericles they were again closely blockaded by the fleet.

1.117.2
730
καὶ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ὕστερον προσεβοήθησαν τεσσαράκοντα μὲν αἱ μετὰ Θουκυδίδου καὶ Ἅγνωνος καὶ Φορμίωνος νῆες , εἴκοσι δὲ αἱ μετὰ Τληπολέμου καὶ Ἀντικλέους , ἐκ δὲ Χίου καὶ Λέσβου τριάκοντα .
Later, reinforcements came from Athens: forty ships with Thucydides, Hagnon, and Phormio, twenty with Tlepolemus and Anticles, and thirty from Chios and Lesbos.

1.117.3
731
καὶ ναυμαχίαν μέν τινα βραχεῖαν ἐποιήσαντο οἱ Σάμιοι , ἀδύνατοι δὲ ὄντες ἀντίσχειν ἐξεπολιορκήθησαν ἐνάτῳ μηνὶ καὶ προσεχώρησαν ὁμολογίᾳ , τεῖχός τε καθελόντες καὶ ὁμήρους δόντες καὶ ναῦς παραδόντες καὶ χρήματα τὰ ἀναλωθέντα ταξάμενοι κατὰ χρόνους ἀποδοῦναι .
The Samians engaged in a brief naval battle but, being unable to withstand, were besieged and in the ninth month surrendered on terms: dismantling their walls, giving hostages
, surrendering their ships, and agreeing to pay back the war expenses over time.

1.117.3
732
ξυνέβησαν δὲ καὶ Βυζάντιοι ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον ὑπήκοοι εἶναι .
The Byzantines also agreed to be subject as before.

1.118.1
733
μετὰ ταῦτα δὲ ἤδη γίγνεται οὐ πολλοῖς ἔτεσιν ὕστερον τὰ προειρημένα , τά τε Κερκυραϊκὰ καὶ τὰ Ποτειδεατικὰ καὶ ὅσα πρόφασις τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου κατέστη .
After these events, not many years later, occurred what we have previously narrated: the affair of Corcyra, that of Potidaea, and everything else that became a pretext for this war.

1.118.2
734
ταῦτα δὲ ξύμπαντα ὅσα ἔπραξαν οἱ Ἕλληνες πρός τε ἀλλήλους καὶ τὸν βάρβαρον ἐγένετο ἐν ἔτεσι πεντήκοντα μάλιστα μεταξὺ τῆς τε Ξέρξου ἀναχωρήσεως καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου ·
All these events, everything that the Greeks did against each other and against the barbarians, occurred primarily in the fifty years between the retreat of Xerxes and the start of this war.

1.118.2
735
ἐν οἷς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τήν τε ἀρχὴν ἐγκρατεστέραν κατεστήσαντο καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐπὶ μέγα ἐχώρησαν δυνάμεως , οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι αἰσθόμενοι οὔτε ἐκώλυον εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ βραχύ , ἡσύχαζόν τε τὸ πλέον τοῦ χρόνου , ὄντες μὲν καὶ πρὸ τοῦ μὴ ταχεῖς ἰέναι ἐς τοὺς πολέμους , ἢν μὴ ἀναγκάζωνται , τὸ δέ τι καὶ πολέμοις οἰκείοις ἐξειργόμενοι , πρὶν δὴ ἡ δύναμις τῶν Ἀθηναίων σαφῶς ᾔρετο καὶ τῆς ξυμμαχίας αὐτῶν ἥπτοντο .
During this period, the Athenians not only established a stronger leadership but also greatly expanded their power. The Lacedaemonians, aware of this, did not intervene except briefly, mainly remaining peaceful for most of the time. They were traditionally not quick to go to war unless forced, and were also distracted by their own internal conflicts, until the power of the Athenians clearly grew and started to encroach on their alliance.

1.118.2
736
τότε δὲ οὐκέτι ἀνασχετὸν ἐποιοῦντο , ἀλλ’ ἐπιχειρητέα ἐδόκει εἶναι πάσῃ προθυμίᾳ καὶ καθαιρετέα ἡ ἰσχύς , ἢν δύνωνται , ἀραμένοις τόνδε τὸν πόλεμον .
However, they no longer deemed it tolerable but believed it necessary to undertake with all eagerness the task of challenging and, if possible, overthrowing the Athenian power by starting this war.

1.118.3
737
αὐτοῖς μὲν οὖν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις διέγνωστο λελύσθαι τε τὰς σπονδὰς καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἀδικεῖν , πέμψαντες δὲ ἐς Δελφοὺς ἐπηρώτων τὸν θεὸν εἰ πολεμοῦσιν ἄμεινον ἔσται ·
The Lacedaemonians were convinced that the truce had been broken and that the Athenians were acting unjustly. They sent to Delphi to inquire of the god whether it would be better for them to go to war.

1.118.3
738
ὁ δὲ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτοῖς , ὡς λέγεται , κατὰ κράτος πολεμοῦσι νίκην ἔσεσθαι , καὶ αὐτὸς ἔφη ξυλλήψεσθαι καὶ παρακαλούμενος καὶ ἄκλητος .
The oracle, as it is said, declared to them that if they fought with all their might, they would be victorious, and that the god himself would be with them, whether summoned or unsought.

1.119.1
739
αὖθις δὲ τοὺς ξυμμάχους παρακαλέσαντες ψῆφον ἐβούλοντο ἐπαγαγεῖν εἰ χρὴ πολεμεῖν.
Still they wished to summon the allies again, and put it to the vote, whether they should go to war.

1.119.1
740
καὶ ἐλθόντων τῶν πρέσβεων ἀπὸ τῆς ξυμμαχίας καὶ ξυνόδου γενομένης οἵ τε ἄλλοι εἶπον ἃ ἐβούλοντο, κατηγοροῦντες οἱ πλείους τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τὸν πόλεμον ἀξιοῦντες γίγνεσθαι, καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι δεηθέντες μὲν καὶ κατὰ πόλεις πρότερον ἑκάστων ἰδίᾳ ὥστε ψηφίσασθαι τὸν πόλεμον, δεδιότες περὶ τῇ Ποτειδαίᾳ μὴ προδιαφθαρῇ, παρόντες δὲ καὶ τότε καὶ τελευταῖοι ἐπελθόντες ἔλεγον τοιάδε.
When the ambassadors had come from the confederates, and an assembly had been held, the others said what they wished, most of them accusing the Athenians, and demanding that war should be declared; and the Corinthians, who had even before begged them each separately, state by state, to vote for the war—being afraid for Potidaea, lest it should be destroyed first—and who were present then also, came forward last, and spoke as follows:

1.120.1
741
τοὺς μὲν Λακεδαιμονίους, ὦ ἄνδρες ξύμμαχοι, οὐκ ἂν ἔτι αἰτιασαίμεθα ὡς οὐ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐψηφισμένοι τὸν πόλεμόν εἰσι καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐς τοῦτο νῦν ξυνήγαγον.
"We can no longer, allies, find fault with the Lacedaemonians, as not having both themselves voted for war, and now brought us together for this purpose: [though we should have blamed them if they had not done so].

1.120.1
742
χρὴ γὰρ τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τὰ ἴδια ἐξ ἴσου νέμοντας τὰ κοινὰ προσκοπεῖν, ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις ἐκ πάντων προτιμῶνται.
For it is the duty of leaders, while they conduct their private affairs on a footing of equality, to provide for the interests of all; as they are also in other respects honoured above all.

1.120.2
743
ἡμῶν δὲ ὅσοι μὲν Ἀθηναίοις ἤδη ἐνηλλάγησαν οὐχὶ διδαχῆς δέονται ὥστε φυλάξασθαι αὐτούς·
Now as many of us as have already had any dealings with the Athenians require no warning to beware of them;

1.120.2
744
τοὺς δὲ τὴν μεσόγειαν μᾶλλον καὶ μὴ ἐν πόρῳ κατῳκημένους εἰδέναι χρὴ ὅτι, τοῖς κάτω ἢν μὴ ἀμύνωσι, χαλεπωτέραν ἕξουσι τὴν κατακομιδὴν τῶν ὡραίων καὶ πάλιν ἀντίληψιν ὧν ἡ θάλασσα τῇ ἠπείρῳ δίδωσι, καὶ τῶν νῦν λεγομένων μὴ κακοὺς κριτὰς ὡς μὴ προσηκόντων εἶναι, προσδέχεσθαι δέ ποτε, εἰ τὰ κάτω πρόοιντο, κἂν μέχρι σφῶν τὸ δεινὸν προελθεῖν, καὶ περὶ αὑτῶν οὐχ ἧσσον νῦν βουλεύεσθαι.
but those who live more in the interior, and not in the high way of communication, ought to know, that if they do not defend those on the coast, they will find the carrying down of their produce [for exportation] more difficult, and the procuring again of those things which the sea affords to the mainland; and they ought not to be indifferent judges of what is now said, as though it did not affect them, but to consider that some time or other, if they should sacrifice the towns on the coast, the danger would reach even to them; and that they are now consulting for themselves no less [than for others].

1.120.3
745
δι’ ὅπερ καὶ μὴ ὀκνεῖν δεῖ αὐτοὺς τὸν πόλεμον ἀντ’ εἰρήνης μεταλαμβάνειν.
And for this reason they ought not to shrink from passing to war instead of peace.

1.120.3
746
ἀνδρῶν γὰρ σωφρόνων μέν ἐστιν , εἰ μὴ ἀδικοῖντο , ἡσυχάζειν , ἀγαθῶν δὲ ἀδικουμένους ἐκ μὲν εἰρήνης πολεμεῖν , εὖ δὲ παρασχὸν ἐκ πολέμου πάλιν ξυμβῆναι , καὶ μήτε τῇ κατὰ πόλεμον εὐτυχίᾳ ἐπαίρεσθαι μήτε τῷ ἡσύχῳ τῆς εἰρήνης ἡδόμενον ἀδικεῖσθαι .
For it is the part of wise men, indeed, to remain quiet, should they not be injured; but of brave men, when injured, to go from peace to war; and when a good opportunity offers, to come to an understanding again from hostilities; and neither to be elated by their success in war, nor to brook injury through being charmed with the quiet of peace.

1.120.4
747
ὅ τε γὰρ διὰ τὴν ἡδονὴν ὀκνῶν τάχιστ’ ἂν ἀφαιρεθείη τῆς ῥᾳστώνης τὸ τερπνὸν δι’ ὅπερ ὀκνεῖ , εἰ ἡσυχάζοι , ὅ τε ἐν πολέμῳ εὐτυχίᾳ πλεονάζων οὐκ ἐντεθύμηται θράσει ἀπίστῳ ἐπαιρόμενος .
For he who shrinks from this course for love of pleasure, would most quickly be deprived of the delights of indolence, for which he shrinks from it, should he remain quiet; and he who in war becomes grasping through success, does not reflect that he is buoyed up by a confidence that cannot be trusted.

1.120.5
748
πολλὰ γὰρ κακῶς γνωσθέντα ἀβουλοτέρων τῶν ἐναντίων τυχόντα κατωρθώθη , καὶ ἔτι πλείω καλῶς δοκοῦντα βουλευθῆναι ἐς τ- ἐναντίον αἰσχρῶς περιέστη ·
For many measures, though badly planned, have yet succeeded, through the adversary being still worse advised; and still more have there been which, though seeming to be well arranged, have on the contrary come to a disgraceful issue.

1.120.5
749
ἐνθυμεῖται γὰρ οὐδεὶς ὁμοῖα τῇ πίστει καὶ ἔργῳ ἐπεξέρχεται , ἀλλὰ μετ’ ἀσφαλείας μὲν δοξάζομεν , μετὰ δέους δὲ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ ἐλλείπομεν .
For no one conceives his plans with the same degree of confidence as he carries them out in action; but we form our opinions in security, and therefore with assurance; whereas we fail in action through fear.

1.121.1
750
"ἡμεῖς δὲ νῦν καὶ ἀδικούμενοι τὸν πόλεμον ἐγείρομεν καὶ ἱκανὰ ἔχοντες ἐγκλήματα , καὶ ὅταν ἀμυνώμεθα Ἀθηναίους , καταθησόμεθα αὐτὸν ἐν καιρῷ .
"Now as for ourselves, we are at the present time preparing for war because we are injured, and have sufficient grounds of complaint; and when we have avenged ourselves on the Athenians, we will lay it down again in good time.

1.121.2
751
κατὰ πολλὰ δὲ ἡμᾶς εἰκὸς ἐπικρατῆσαι , πρῶτον μὲν πλήθει προύχοντας καὶ ἐμπειρίᾳ πολεμικῇ , ἔπειτα ὁμοίως πάντας ἐς τὰ παραγγελλόμενα ἰόντας , ναυτικόν τε , ᾧ ἰσχύουσιν , ἀπὸ τῆς ὑπαρχούσης τε ἑκάστοις οὐσίας ἐξαρτυσόμεθα καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν Δελφοῖς καὶ Ὀλυμπίᾳ χρημάτων ·
And for many reasons it is likely that we should have the advantage; first, as we are superior in numbers and military experience; and secondly, as we all proceed with equal obedience to do what we are ordered. And for a fleet, in which they are so strong, we will equip one from the property we severally possess, and from the money at Delphi and Olympia;

1.121.3
752
δάνεισμα γὰρ ποιησάμενοι ὑπολαβεῖν οἷοί τ’ ἐσμὲν μισθῷ μείζονι τοὺς ξένους αὐτῶν ναυβάτας .
for by contracting a loan of that we shall be able, by means of higher pay, to rob them of their foreign sailors.

1.121.3
753
ὠνητὴ γὰρ ἡ Ἀθηναίων δύναμις μᾶλλον ἢ οἰκεία ·
For the power of the Athenians is mercenary, rather than native;

1.121.3
754
ἡ δὲ ἡμετέρα ἧσσον ἂν τοῦτο πάθοι , τοῖς σώμασι τὸ πλέον ἰσχύουσα ἢ τοῖς χρήμασιν .
but ours would be less exposed to this, as it is strong in men more than in money.

1.121.4
755
μιᾷ τε νίκῃ ναυμαχίας κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἁλίσκονται ·
And by one victory [gained by us] in a sea-fight, in all probability they are ruined;

1.121.4
756
εἰ δ’ ἀντίσχοιεν , μελετήσο

1.121.4
757
ὃ γὰρ ἡμεῖς ἔχομεν φύσει ἀγαθόν , ἐκείνοις οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο διδαχῇ ·
For the advantage which we possess by nature cannot be acquired by them through learning;

1.121.4
758
ὃ δ’ ἐκεῖνοι ἐπιστήμῃ προύχουσι , καθαιρετὸν ἡμῖν ἐστὶ μελέτῃ .
whereas the superiority which they have in point of skill may be attained by us through practice.

1.121.5
759
χρήματα δὲ ὥστε ἔχειν ἐς αὐτά , οἴσομεν ·
And to have money for this purpose, we will raise contributions;

1.121.5
760
ἢ δεινὸν ἂν εἴη εἰ οἱ μὲν ἐκείνων ξύμμαχοι ἐπὶ δουλείᾳ τῇ αὑτῶν φέροντες οὐκ ἀπεροῦσιν , ἡμεῖς δ’ ἐπὶ τῷ τιμωρούμενοι τοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ αὐτοὶ ἅμα σῴζεσθαι οὐκ ἄρα δαπανήσομεν καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ μὴ ὑπ’ ἐκείνων αὐτὰ ἀφαιρεθέντες αὐτοῖς τούτοις κακῶς πάσχειν .
or strange were it, if their allies should not refuse to contribute it for their own slavery, while we would not spend it to be avenged on our enemies, and to save ourselves at the same time, and to avoid suffering by means of this very money, through having it taken from us by them.

1.122.1
761
ὑπάρχουσι δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι ὁδοὶ τοῦ πολέμου ἡμῖν , ξυμμάχων τε ἀπόστασις , μάλιστα παραίρεσις οὖσα τῶν προσόδων αἷς ἰσχύουσι , καὶ ἐπιτειχισμὸς τῇ χώρᾳ , ἄλλα τε ὅσα οὐκ ἄν τις νῦν προΐδοι .
"We have also other ways of carrying on war, such as causing their allies to revolt, (which is the most effectual mode of taking from them the revenues in which they are so strong,) and [*] raising works to annoy their country; with other things which one could not now foresee.

1.122.1
762
ἥκιστα γὰρ πόλεμος ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς χωρεῖ , αὐτὸς δὲ ἀφ’ αὑτοῦ τὰ πολλὰ τεχνᾶται πρὸς τὸ παρατυγχάνον ·
For war least of all things proceeds on definite principles, but adopts most of its contrivances from itself to suit the occasion.

1.122.1
763
ἐν ᾧ ὁ μὲν εὐοργήτως αὐτῷ προσομιλήσας βεβαιότερος , ὁ δ’ ὀργισθεὶς περὶ αὐτὸν οὐκ ἐλάσσω πταίει .
In the course of which he that deals with it with good temper is more secure; while he that engages in it with passion makes the greater failure.

1.122.2
764
ἐνθυμώμεθα δὲ καὶ ὅτι εἰ μὲν ἡμῶν ἦσαν ἑκάστοις πρὸς ἀντιπάλους περὶ γῆς ὅρων αἱ διαφοραί , οἰστὸν ἂν ἦν ·
Let us reflect also, that if we were severally engaged in quarrels with our equals about boundaries of territory, it might be borne.

1.122.2
765
νῦν δὲ πρὸς ξύμπαντάς τε ἡμᾶς Ἀθηναῖοι ἱκανοὶ καὶ κατὰ πόλιν ἔτι δυνατώτεροι , ὥστε εἰ μὴ καὶ ἁθρόοι καὶ κατὰ ἔθνη καὶ ἕκαστον ἄστυ μιᾷ γνώμῃ ἀμυνούμεθα αὐτούς , δίχα γε ὄντας ἡμᾶς ἀπόνως χειρώσονται .
But as it is, the Athenians are a match for us all together, and still more powerful against single states; so that unless all in a body, and nation by nation, and city by city, with one mind we defend ourselves against them, they will certainly subdue us without trouble, when divided.

1.122.2
766
καὶ τὴν ἧσσαν , εἰ καὶ δεινόν τῳ ἀκοῦσαι , ἴστω οὐκ ἄλλο τι φέρουσαν ἢ ἄντικρυς δουλείαν ·
And as for defeat, though it may be a terrible thing for any one to hear of, let him know that it brings nothing else but downright slavery.

1.122.3
767
ὃ καὶ λόγῳ ἐνδοιασθῆναι αἰσχρὸν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ καὶ πόλεις τοσάσδε ὑπὸ μιᾶς κακοπαθεῖν .
Which is disgraceful for the Peloponnese to be even mentioned as contingent, and for so many cities to be ill-treated by one.

1.122.3
768
ἐν ᾧ ἢ δικαίως δοκοῖμεν ἂν πάσχειν ἢ διὰ δειλίαν ἀνέχεσθαι καὶ τῶν πατέρων χείρους φαίνεσθαι , οἳ τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἠλευθέρωσαν , ἡμεῖς δὲ οὐδ’ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς βεβαιοῦμεν αὐτό , τύραννον δὲ ἐῶμεν ἐγκαθεστάναι πόλιν , τοὺς δ’ ἐν μιᾷ μονάρχους ἀξιοῦμεν καταλύειν .
In that case we should appear either to be justly treated, or to put up with it through cowardice, and to show ourselves inferior to our fathers, who liberated Greece; whereas we do not even secure this liberty for ourselves, but allow a tyrant state to set itself up amongst us, though we think it right to put down monarchs in any one state.

1.122.4
769
καὶ οὐκ ἴσμεν ὅπως τάδε τριῶν τῶν μεγίστων ξυμφορῶν ἀπήλλακται , ἀξυνεσίας ἢ μαλακίας ἢ ἀμελείας .
And we do not know how this conduct is cleared of three of the greatest evils, folly, or cowardice, or carelessness.

1.122.4
770
οὐ γὰρ δὴ πεφευγότες αὐτὰ ἐπὶ τὴν πλείστους δὴ βλάψασαν καταφρόνησιν κεχωρήκατε , ἣ ἐκ τοῦ πολλοὺς σφάλλειν τὸ ἐναντίον ὄνομα ἀφροσύνη μετωνόμασται .
For you certainly have not escaped these by betaking yourselves to that contempt of your foes, which has injured far more than any thing else; and which, from ruining so many, has been called by the opposite name of senselessness.

1.123.1
771
τὰ μὲν οὖν προγεγενημένα τί δεῖ μακρότερον ἢ ἐς ὅσον τοῖς νῦν ξυμφέρει αἰτιᾶσθαι ;
With regard then to what has been done before, why need we find fault with it at greater length than is expedient for what is doing now?

1.123.1
772
περὶ δὲ τῶν ἔπειτα μελλόντων τοῖς παροῦσι βοηθοῦντας χρὴ ἐπιταλαιπωρεῖν ( πάτριον γὰρ ὑμῖν ἐκ τῶν πόνων τὰς ἀρετὰς κτᾶσθαι ) , καὶ μὴ μεταβάλλειν τὸ ἔθος , εἰ ἄρα πλούτῳ τε νῦν καὶ ἐξουσίᾳ ὀλίγον προφέρετε ( οὐ γὰρ δίκαιον ἃ τῇ ἀπορίᾳ ἐκτήθη τῇ περιουσίᾳ ἀπολέσθαι ) , ἀλλὰ θαρσοῦντας ἰέναι κατὰ πολλὰ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον , τοῦ τε θεοῦ χρήσαντος καὶ αὐτοῦ ὑποσχομένου ξυλλήψεσθαι καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος ἁπάσης ξυναγωνιουμένης , τὰ μὲν φόβῳ , τὰ δὲ ὠφελίᾳ .
But with respect to what will be hereafter, we must labour for it by supporting what is present; for it is our hereditary custom to acquire virtues by labours; and you must not change the fashion, if you have a slight superiority now in wealth and power; (for it is not right that what was won in want should be lost in abundance;) but must go to the war with good courage on many grounds; since the god has commanded it, and promised to take part with you himself; while the rest of Greece will all join you in the struggle, some for fear, and some for interest. Nor will you be the first to break the treaty;

1.123.2
773
σπονδάς τε οὐ λύσετε πρότεροι , ἅς γε καὶ ὁ θεὸς κελεύων πολεμεῖν νομίζει παραβεβάσθαι , ἠδικημέναις δὲ μᾶλλον βοηθήσετε ·
Nor will you be the first to break the truce, which even the god, commanding to go to war, considers to have been violated, but you will rather come to its support after it has been wronged.

1.123.2
774
λύουσι γὰρ οὐχ οἱ ἀμυνόμενοι , ἀλλ’ οἱ πρότεροι ἐπιόντες .
For the breakers of it are not those who defend themselves, but those who were the first aggressors.

1.124.1
775
ὥστε πανταχόθεν καλῶς ὑπάρχον ὑμῖν πολεμεῖν καὶ ἡμῶν κοινῇ τάδε παραινούντων , εἴπερ βεβαιότατον τὸ τ- αὐτὰ ξυμφέροντα καὶ πόλεσι καὶ ἰδιώταις εἶναι , μὴ μέλλετε Ποτειδεάταις τε ποιεῖσθαι τιμωρίαν οὖσι Δωριεῦσι καὶ ὑπὸ Ἰώνων πολιορκουμένοις , οὗ πρότερον ἦν τ- ἐναντίον , καὶ τῶν ἄλλων μετελθεῖν τὴν ἐλευθερίαν , ὡς οὐκέτι ἐνδέχεται περιμένοντας τοὺς μὲν ἤδη βλάπτεσθαι , τοὺς δ’ , εἰ γνωσθησόμεθα ξυνελθόντες μέν , ἀμύνεσθαι δὲ οὐ τολμῶντες , μὴ πολὺ ὕστερον τὸ αὐτὸ πάσχειν ·
So then, since on every ground you have good reason for going to war, and since we all in common recommend this, inasmuch as it is most certain that this is expedient both for states and individuals [in our league]; do not defer to assist the Potidaeans, who are Dorians, and are besieged by Ionians, (the contrary of which used formerly to be the case,) and to vindicate the liberty of the rest; since it is no longer possible for them to wait, while some are already injured, and others will be treated in the same way not much later, if we shall be known to have come together, but not to dare to avenge ourselves.

1.124.2
776
ἀλλὰ νομίσαντες ἐς ἀνάγκην ἀφῖχθαι , ὦ ἄνδρες ξύμμαχοι , καὶ ἅμα τάδε ἄριστα λέγεσθαι , ψηφίσασθε τὸν πόλεμον μὴ φοβηθέντες τὸ αὐτίκα δεινόν , τῆς δ’ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ διὰ πλείονος εἰρήνης ἐπιθυμήσαντες ·
But considering, allies, that we have reached a point of necessity, and, moreover, that what is mentioned is the best course, vote for the war; not being afraid of the immediate danger, but setting your hearts on the more lasting peace that will result from it.

1.124.2
777
ἐκ πολέμου μὲν γὰρ εἰρήνη μᾶλλον βεβαιοῦται , ἀφ’ ἡσυχίας δὲ μὴ πολεμῆσαι οὐχ ὁμοίως ἀκίνδυνον .
For it is by war that peace is rendered more stable; but to refuse to pass from a state of quiet to one of war is not equally free from danger.

1.124.3
778
καὶ τὴν καθεστηκυῖαν ἐν τῇ Ἑλλάδι πόλιν τύραννον ἡγησάμενοι ἐπὶ πᾶσιν ὁμοίως καθεστάναι , ὥστε τῶν μὲν ἤδη ἄρχειν , τῶν δὲ διανοεῖσθαι ,παραστησώμεθα ἐπελθόντες , καὶ αὐτοί τε ἀκινδύνως τὸ λοιπὸν οἰκῶμεν καὶ τοὺς νῦν δεδουλωμένους Ἕλληνας ἐλευθερώσωμεν " .
Being of opinion then that the tyrant state which has set itself up in Greece, has set itself up against all alike, so that it already rules over some, and is designing to rule over others, let us go against it and reduce it; and live ourselves free from danger in future, and give freedom to the Greeks who are now enslaved.

1.124.3
779
τοιαῦτα μὲν οἱ Κορίνθιοι εἶπον .
To this effect spoke the Corinthians.

1.125.1
780
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐπειδὴ ἀφ’ ἁπάντων ἤκουσαν γνώμην , ψῆφον ἐπήγαγον τοῖς ξυμμάχοις ἅπασιν ὅσοι παρῆσαν ἑξῆς , καὶ μείζονι καὶ ἐλάσσονι πόλει ·
The Lacedaemonians, after they had heard from all what they thought, put the question to the vote of all the allies who were present in succession, both to greater and smaller states alike.

1.125.1
781
καὶ τ

1.125.2
782
δεδογμένον δὲ αὐτοῖς εὐθὺς μὲν ἀδύνατα ἦν ἐπιχειρεῖν ἀπαρασκεύοις οὖσιν , ἐκπορίζεσθαι δὲ ἐδόκει ἑκάστοις ἃ πρόσφορα ἦν καὶ μὴ εἶναι μέλλησιν .
But though they had resolved on it, it was impossible to take it in hand immediately, as they were unprepared; but it was determined that suitable means should be provided by the several states, and that there should be no delay.

1.125.2
783
ὅμως δὲ καθισταμένοις ὧν ἔδει ἐνιαυτὸς μὲν οὐ διετρίβη , ἔλασσον δέ , πρὶν ἐσβαλεῖν ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν καὶ τὸν πόλεμον ἄρασθαι φανερῶς .
A year, however, did not pass while they were settling all that was necessary, but less, before they invaded Attica, and openly proceeded to the war.

1.126.1
784
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἐπρεσβεύοντο τῷ χρόνῳ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐγκλήματα ποιούμενοι , ὅπως σφίσιν ὅτι μεγίστη πρόφασις εἴη τοῦ πολεμεῖν , ἢν μή τι ἐσακούωσιν .
During this time they were sending ambassadors to the Athenians with complaints, in order that they might have as good a pretext as possible for the war, in case they should not listen to them.

1.126.2
785
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν πρέσβεις πέμψαντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐκέλευον τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τὸ ἄγος ἐλαύνειν τῆς θεοῦ ·
And first of all, the Lacedaemonians, having sent ambassadors, ordered the Athenians to drive out the pollution of the goddess;

1.126.2
786
τὸ δὲ ἄγος ἦν τοιόνδε .
The pollution was of the following nature.

1.126.3
787
Κύλων ἦν Ἀθηναῖος ἀνὴρ Ὀλυμπιονίκης τῶν πάλαι εὐγενής τε καὶ δυνατός , ἐγεγαμήκει δὲ θυγατέρα Θεαγένους Μεγαρέως ἀνδρός , ὃς κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον ἐτυράννει Μεγάρων .
Cylon was an Athenian man, a victorious Olympic athlete from old times, noble and powerful. He had married the daughter of Theagenes, a man from Megara, who at that time was tyrant of Megara.

1.126.4
788
χρωμένῳ δὲ τῷ Κύλωνι ἐν Δελφοῖς ἀνεῖλεν ὁ θεὸς ἐν τοῦ Διὸς τῇ μεγίστῃ ἑορτῇ καταλαβεῖν τὴν Ἀθηναίων ἀκρόπολιν .
When Cylon was consulting the oracle at Delphi, the god instructed him to seize the Athenian Acropolis during the greatest feast of Zeus.

1.126.5
789
ὁ δὲ παρά τε τοῦ Θεαγένους δύναμιν λαβὼν καὶ τοὺς φίλους ἀναπείσας , ἐπειδὴ ἐπῆλθεν Ὀλύμπια τὰ ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ , κατέλαβε τὴν ἀκρόπολιν ὡς ἐπὶ τυραννίδι , νομίσας ἑορτήν τε τοῦ Διὸς μεγίστην εἶναι καὶ ἑαυτῷ τι προσήκειν Ὀλύμπια νενικηκότι .
Cylon, having gained support from Theagenes and convinced his friends, seized the Acropolis to establish a tyranny when the Olympic festival in the Peloponnese occurred, believing it to be the greatest festival of Zeus and appropriate for himself as an Olympic victor.

1.126.6
790
εἰ δὲ ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ἢ ἄλλοθί που ἡ μεγίστη ἑορτὴ εἴρητο , οὔτε ἐκεῖνος ἔτι κατενόησε τό τε μαντεῖον οὐκ ἐδήλου ( ἔστι γὰρ καὶ Ἀθηναίοις Διάσια ἃ καλεῖται Διὸς ἑορτὴ Μειλιχίου μεγίστη ἔξω τῆς πόλεως , ἐν ᾗ πανδημεὶ θύουσι πολλὰ οὐχ ἱερεῖα , ἀλλ’ ἁγνὰ θύματα ἐπιχώρια ) , δοκῶν δὲ ὀρθῶς γιγνώσκειν ἐπεχείρησε τῷ ἔργῳ .

1.126.7
791
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι αἰσθόμενοι ἐβοήθησάν τε πανδημεὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ προσκαθεζόμενοι ἐπολιόρκουν.
The Athenians, on perceiving it, ran in a body from the fields to resist them, and sitting down before the place besieged them.

1.126.8
792
χρόνου δὲ ἐγγιγνομένου οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τρυχόμενοι τῇ προσεδρίᾳ ἀπῆλθον οἱ πολλοί, ἐπιτρέψαντες τοῖς ἐννέα ἄρχουσι τήν τε φυλακὴν καὶ τὸ πᾶν αὐτοκράτορσι διαθεῖναι ᾗ ἂν ἄριστα διαγιγνώσκωσιν·
But as time went on, being tired out by the blockade, most of them went away, having commissioned the nine Archons to keep guard, and to arrange everything with full powers, as they should consider best.

1.126.8
793
τότε δὲ τὰ πολλὰ τῶν πολιτικῶν οἱ ἐννέα ἄρχοντες ἔπρασσον.
For at that time the nine Archons transacted most of the state affairs.

1.126.9
794
οἱ δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Κύλωνος πολιορκούμενοι φλαύρως εἶχον σίτου τε καὶ ὕδατος ἀπορίᾳ.
Now those who were besieged with Cylon were in a wretched condition for want of food and water.

1.126.10
795
ὁ μὲν οὖν Κύλων καὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐκδιδράσκουσιν·
Cylon therefore and his brother made their escape,

1.126.10
796
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ὡς ἐπιέζοντο καί τινες καὶ ἀπέθνῃσκον ὑπὸ τοῦ λιμοῦ, καθίζουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν βωμὸν ἱκέται τὸν ἐν τῇ ἀκροπόλει.
but when the rest were pressed hard, and some were even dying of famine, they seated themselves as suppliants on the altar of the Acropolis.

1.126.11
797
ἀναστήσαντες δὲ αὐτοὺς οἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπιτετραμμένοι τὴν φυλακήν, ὡς ἑώρων ἀποθνῄσκοντας ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, ἐφ’ ᾧ μηδὲν κακὸν ποιήσουσιν, ἀπαγαγό

1.126.11
798
καθεζομένους δέ τινας καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν σεμνῶν θεῶν τοῖς βωμοῖς ἐν τῇ παρόδῳ ἀπεχρήσαντο.
while some who were seated before the Awful Goddesses [*] they despatched on the altars at the side entrance.

1.126.11
799
καὶ ἀπὸ τούτου ἐναγεῖς καὶ ἀλιτήριοι τῆς θεοῦ ἐκεῖνοί τε ἐκαλοῦντο καὶ τὸ γένος τὸ ἀπ’ ἐκείνων.
And from this both they and their descendants after them were called accursed of, and offenders against, the goddess.

1.126.12
800
ἤλασαν μὲν οὖν καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς ἐναγεῖς τούτους, ἤλασε δὲ καὶ Κλεομένης ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος ὕστερον μετὰ Ἀθηναίων στασιαζόντων, τούς τε ζῶντας ἐλαύνοντες καὶ τῶν τεθνεώτων τὰ ὀστᾶ ἀνελόντες ἐξέβαλον·
The Athenians therefore expelled these accursed ones, and Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian also expelled them subsequently, in conjunction with some Athenian partisans, both driving out the living, and taking up and casting out the bones of the dead.

1.126.12
801
κατῆλθον μέντοι ὕστερον, καὶ τὸ γένος αὐτῶν ἔστιν ἔτι ἐν τῇ πόλει.
They returned, however, afterwards, and their descendants are still in the city.

1.127.1
802
τοῦτο δὴ τὸ ἄγος οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐκέλευον ἐλαύνειν δῆθεν τοῖς θεοῖς πρῶτον τιμωροῦντες, εἰδότες δὲ Περικλέα τὸν Ξανθίππου προσεχόμενον αὐτῷ κατὰ τὴν μητέρα καὶ νομίζοντες ἐκπεσόντος αὐτοῦ ῥᾷον ἂν σφίσι προχωρεῖν τὰ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων.
This pollution then the Lacedaemonians ordered them to drive out; principally, as they professed, to avenge the honour of the gods; but really, because they knew that Pericles, the son of Xanthippus, was connected with it on his mother's side, and thought that if he were banished, their business with the Athenians would more easily succeed.

1.127.2
803
οὐ μέντοι τοσοῦτον ἤλπιζον παθεῖν ἂν αὐτὸν τοῦτο ὅσον διαβολὴν οἴσειν αὐτῷ πρὸς τὴν πόλιν ὡς καὶ διὰ τὴν ἐκείνου ξυμφορὰν τὸ μέρος ἔσται ὁ πόλεμος.
They did not, however, so much hope that he would be treated in that way, as that it would cause a prejudice against him in the city; from an idea that the war would in part be occasioned by his misfortune.

1.127.3
804
ὢν γὰρ δυνατώτατος τῶν καθ’ ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἄγων τὴν πολιτείαν ἠναντιοῦτο πάντα τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις, καὶ οὐκ εἴα ὑπείκειν, ἀλλ’ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον ὥρμα τοὺς Ἀθηναίους.
For being the most powerful man of his time, and taking the lead in the government, he opposed the Lacedaemonians in everything, and would not let the Athenians make concessions, but instigated them to hostilities.

1.128.1
805
ἀντεκέλευον δὲ καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους τὸ ἀπὸ Ταινάρου ἄγος ἐλαύνειν·
The Athenians also, in return, commanded the Lacedaemonians to drive out the pollution of Taenarus.

1.128.1
806
οἱ γὰρ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀναστήσαντές ποτε ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος ἀπὸ Ταινάρου τῶν Ε

1.128.2
807
ἐκέλευον δὲ καὶ τὸ τῆς Χαλκιοίκου ἄγος ἐλαύνειν αὐτούς·
They likewise ordered them to drive out the curse of Minerva of the Brazen-House; which was of the following kind.

1.128.2
808
ἐγένετο δὲ τοιόνδε.  
[Here follows the story.]

1.128.3
809
ἐπειδὴ Παυσανίας ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος τὸ πρῶτον μεταπεμφθεὶς ὑπὸ Σπαρτιατῶν ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς τῆς ἐν Ἑλλησπόντῳ καὶ κριθεὶς ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἀπελύθη μὴ ἀδικεῖν, δημοσίᾳ μὲν οὐκέτι ἐξεπέμφθη, ἰδίᾳ δὲ αὐτὸς τριήρη λαβὼν Ἑρμιονίδα ἄνευ Λακεδαιμονίων ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Ἑλλήσποντον, τῷ μὲν λόγῳ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλληνικὸν πόλεμον, τῷ δὲ ἔργῳ τὰ πρὸς βασιλέα πράγματα πράσσειν, ὥσπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἐπεχείρησεν, ἐφιέμενος τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς ἀρχῆς.
When Pausanias the Lacedaemonian, after being sent for by the Spartans for the first time from his command in the Hellespont, and brought to trial, was acquitted by them as not guilty, he was not sent out again in a public capacity; but in a private capacity, of his own accord, he took a trireme of Hermione, without the authority of the Lacedaemonians, and came to the Hellespont; nominally, to join in the war of the Greeks; but really, to carry out his measures with the king; which he had undertaken, in the first instance, from a desire of sovereignty over Greece.

1.128.4
810
εὐεργεσίαν δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦδε πρῶτον ἐς βασιλέα κατέθετο καὶ τοῦ παντὸς πράγματος ἀρχὴν ἐποιήσατο·
Now it was from the following fact that he first established a claim for service with the king, and made a commencement of the whole business.

1.128.5
811
Βυζάντιον γὰρ ἑλὼν τῇ προτέρᾳ παρουσίᾳ μετὰ τὴν ἐκ Κύπρου ἀναχώρησιν (εἶχον δὲ Μῆδοι αὐτὸ καὶ βασιλέως προσήκοντές τινες καὶ ξυγγενεῖς οἳ ἑάλωσαν ἐν αὐτῷ) τότε τούτους οὓς ἔλαβεν ἀποπέμπει βασιλεῖ κρύφα τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων, τῷ δὲ λόγῳ ἀπέδρασαν αὐτόν.
Having taken Byzantium when he was there before, after the return from Cyprus, (the Medes were in possession of it, and some connexions and relations of the king were taken in it,) on that occasion he sent back to the king those whom he had taken, not letting the other allies know, but giving out that they had escaped from him.

1.128.6
812
ἔπρασσε δὲ ταῦτα μετὰ Γογγύλου τοῦ Ἐρετριῶς, ᾧπερ ἐπέτρεψε τό τε Βυζάντιον καὶ τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους.
This he managed in concert with Gongylus the Eretrian, to whom he had committed Byzantium and the prisoners.

1.128.6
813
ἔπεμψε δὲ καὶ ἐπιστολὴν τὸν Γόγγυλον φέροντα αὐτῷ·
He also sent Gongylus with a letter to him;

1.128.6
814
ἐνεγέγραπτο δὲ τάδε ἐν αὐτῇ, ὡς ὕστερον ἀνηυρέθη·
In which, as was afterwards discovered, the following was written:

1.128.7
815
"Παυσανίας ὁ ἡγεμὼν τῆς Σπάρτης τούσδε τέ σοι χαρίζεσθαι βουλόμενος ἀποπέμπει δορὶ ἑλών, καὶ γνώμην ποιοῦμαι, εἰ καὶ σοὶ δοκεῖ, θυγατέρα τε τὴν σὴν γῆμαι καί σοι Σπάρτην τε καὶ τὴν ἄλλην Ἑλλάδα ὑποχείριον ποιῆσαι.  
"Pausanias, the general of Sparta, wishing to oblige thee, sends these men back to thee, after taking them in war. And I make a proposal, if thou also art pleased with it, that I should marry thy daughter, and make Sparta and the rest of Greece subject to thee.

1.128.7
816
δυνατὸς δὲ δοκῶ εἶναι ταῦτα πρᾶξαι μετὰ σοῦ βουλευόμενος.
And I think that I am able to do this in concert with thee.

1.128.7
817
εἰ οὖν τί σε τούτων ἀρέσκει, πέμπε ἄνδρα πιστὸν ἐπὶ θάλασσαν δι’ οὗ τὸ λοιπὸν τοὺς λόγους ποιησόμεθα".
If then any of these proposals please thee, send a trustworthy man to the sea, through whom in future we will confer."

1.129.1
818
τοσαῦτα μὲν ἡ γραφὴ ἐδήλου, Ξέρξης δὲ ἥσθη τε τῇ ἐπιστολῇ καὶ ἀποστέλλει Ἀρτάβαζον τὸν Φαρνάκου ἐπὶ θάλασσαν καὶ κελεύει αὐτὸν τήν τε Δασκυλῖτιν σατραπείαν παραλαβεῖν Μεγαβάτην ἀπαλλάξαντα, ὃς πρότερον ἦρχε, καὶ παρὰ Παυσανίαν ἐς Βυζάντιον ἐπιστολὴν ἀντεπετίθει αὐτῷ ὡς τάχιστα διαπέμψαι καὶ τὴν σφραγῖδα ἀποδεῖξαι, καὶ ἤν τι αὐτῷ Παυσανίας παραγγέλλῃ περὶ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ πραγμάτων, πράσσειν ὡς ἄριστα καὶ πιστότατα.
Such was the purport of the writing; and Xerxes was pleased with the letter, and sent Artabazus, the son of Pharnaces, to the sea, and ordered him to succeed to the satrapy of Dascylium, superseding Megabates, who was governor before; and gave him a letter in answer, to send over as quickly as possible to Pausanias at Byzantium, and to show him the seal; and whatever message Pausanias should send him on his own affairs, to execute it in the best and most faithful manner possible.

1.129.2
819
ὁ δὲ ἀφικόμενος τὰ τε ἄλλα ἐποίησεν ὥσπερ εἴρητο καὶ τὴν ἐπιστολὴν διέπεμψεν.
On his arrival he did every thing as had been told him, and also sent over the letter.

1.129.3
820
ἀντενεγέγραπτο δὲ τάδε·
The reply was as follows:

1.129.3
821
"ὧδε λέγει βασιλεὺς Ξέρξης Παυσανίᾳ.  
"Thus saith King Xerxes to Pausanias.

1.129.3
822
καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν οὕς μοι πέραν θαλάσσης ἐκ Βυζαντίου ἔσωσας κείσεταί σοι εὐεργεσία ἐν τῷ ἡμετέρῳ οἴκῳ ἐς αἰεὶ ἀνάγραπτος, καὶ τοῖς λόγοις τοῖς ἀπὸ σοῦ ἀρέσκομαι.
For the men whom thou hast saved from Byzantium, and sent over the sea to me, there is laid up for thee in our house [the record of] a benefit registered for ever; and I am also pleased with thy proposals.

1.129.3
823
καί σε μήτε νὺξ μήθ’ ἡμέρα ἐπισχέτω ὥστε ἀνεῖναι πράσσειν τι ὧν ἐμοὶ ὑπισχνῇ, μηδὲ χρυσοῦ καὶ ἀργύρου δαπάνῃ κεκωλύσθω μηδὲ στρατιᾶς πλήθει, εἴ ποι δεῖ παραγίγνεσθαι, ἀλλὰ μετ’ Ἀρταβάζου ἀνδρὸς ἀγαθοῦ, ὅν σοι ἔπεμψα, πρᾶσσε θαρσῶν καὶ τὰ ἐμὰ καὶ τὰ σὰ ὅπῃ κάλλιστα καὶ ἄριστα ἕξει ἀμφοτέροις".
And let neither night nor day stop thee, that thou shouldst be remiss in doing any of the things which thou hast promised me: neither let them be impeded by outlay of gold or silver, nor by number of troops, whithersoever there is need of their coming; but in conjunction with Artabazus, an honourable man, whom I have sent to thee, fear not to promote both my interest and thine own, as shall be most creditable and advantageous for both."

1.130.1
824
ταῦτα λαβὼν ὁ Παυσανίας τὰ γράμματα, ὢν καὶ πρότερον ἐν μεγάλῳ ἀξιώματι ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων διὰ τὴν Πλαταιᾶσιν ἡγεμονίαν, πολλῷ τότε μᾶλλον ἦρτο καὶ οὐκέτι ἐδύνατο ἐν τῷ καθεστῶτι τρόπῳ βιοτεύειν, ἀλλὰ σκευάς τε Μηδικ

1.130.2
825
δυσπρόσοδόν τε αὑτὸν παρεῖχε καὶ τῇ ὀργῇ οὕτω χαλεπῇ ἐχρῆτο ἐς πάντας ὁμοίως ὥστε μηδένα δύνασθαι προσιέναι·
He became difficult to approach and used such a violent temper towards everyone that no one could approach him;

1.130.2
826
δι’ ὅπερ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οὐχ ἥκιστα ἡ ξυμμαχία μετέστη.
And for this reason, among others, the alliance shifted significantly in favor of the Athenians.

1.131.1
827
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι αἰσθόμενοι τό τε πρῶτον δι’ αὐτὰ ταῦτα ἀνεκάλεσαν αὐτόν , καὶ ἐπειδὴ τῇ Ἑρμιονίδι νηὶ τὸ δεύτερον ἐκπλεύσας οὐ κελευσάντων αὐτῶν τοιαῦτα ἐφαίνετο ποιῶν , καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Βυζαντίου βίᾳ ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων ἐκπολιορκηθεὶς ἐς μὲν τὴν Σπάρτην οὐκ ἐπανεχώρει , ἐς δὲ Κολωνὰς τὰς Τρῳάδας ἱδρυθεὶς πράσσων τε ἐσηγγέλλετο αὐτοῖς ἐς τοὺς βαρβάρους καὶ οὐκ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ τὴν μονὴν ποιούμενος , οὕτω δὴ οὐκέτι ἐπέσχον , ἀλλὰ πέμψαντες κήρυκα οἱ ἔφοροι καὶ σκυτάλην εἶπον τοῦ κήρυκος μὴ λείπεσθαι , εἰ δὲ μή , πόλεμον αὐτῷ Σπαρτιάτας προαγορεύειν .
Now the Spartans had no clear proof, neither his enemies nor the state at large, on which they could safely rely in punishing a man who was of the royal family and at present holding an honourable office; (for as his cousin and guardian, he was regent for Pleistarchus, the son of Leonidas, who was king and at present a minor;) but by his contempt of the laws, and imitation of the barbarians, he gave room for many suspicions of his not wishing to be content with things as they were.

1.131.2
828
ὁ δὲ βουλόμενος ὡς ἥκιστα ὕποπτος εἶναι καὶ πιστεύων χρήμασι διαλύσειν τὴν διαβολὴν ἀνεχώρει τὸ δεύτερον ἐς Σπάρτην.
Wishing to be as little suspected as possible, and trusting to quash the charge by means of money, he proceeded to return the second time to Sparta.

1.131.2
829
καὶ ἐς μὲν τὴν εἱρκτὴν ἐσπίπτει τὸ πρῶτον ὑπὸ τῶν ἐφόρων (ἔξεστι δὲ τοῖς ἐφόροις τὸν βασιλέα δρᾶσαι τοῦτο), ἔπειτα διαπραξάμενος ὕστερον ἐξῆλθε καὶ καθίστησιν ἑαυτὸν ἐς κρίσιν τοῖς βουλομένοις περὶ αὐτῶν ἐλέγχειν.
And at first, he was thrown into prison by the ephors (for the ephors have the power to do this to a king), but afterwards, having settled the business, he subsequently came out, and offered himself for trial to those who wished to examine into his case.

1.132.1
830
καὶ φανερὸν μὲν εἶχον οὐδὲν οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται σημεῖον, οὔτε οἱ ἐχθροὶ οὔτε ἡ πᾶσα πόλις, ὅτῳ ἂν πιστεύσαντες βεβαίως ἐτιμωροῦντο ἄνδρα γένους τε τοῦ βασιλείου ὄντα καὶ ἐν τῷ παρόντι τιμὴν ἔχοντα (Πλείσταρχον γὰρ τὸν Λεωνίδου ὄντα βασιλέα καὶ νέον ἔτι ἀνεψιὸς ὢν ἐπετρόπευεν), ὑποψίας δὲ πολλὰς παρεῖχε τῇ τε παρανομίᾳ καὶ ζηλώσει τῶν βαρβάρων μὴ ἴσος βούλεσθαι εἶναι τοῖς παροῦσι, τά τε ἄλλα αὐτοῦ ἀνεσκόπουν, εἴ τί που ἐξεδεδιῄτητο τῶν καθεστώτων νομίμων, καὶ ὅτι ἐπὶ τὸν τρίποδά ποτε τὸν ἐν Δελφοῖς, ὃν ἀνέθεσαν οἱ Ἕλληνες ἀπὸ τῶν Μήδων ἀκροθίνιον, ἠξίωσεν ἐπιγράψασθαι αὐτὸς ἰδίᾳ τὸ ἐλεγεῖον τόδε·
Now the Spartans had no clear proof, neither his enemies nor the state at large, on which they could safely rely in punishing a man who was of the royal family and at present holding an honourable office; (for as his cousin and guardian, he was regent for Pleistarchus, the son of Leonidas, who was king and at present a minor;) but by his contempt of the laws, and imitation of the barbarians, he gave room for many suspicions of his not wishing to be content with things as they were. And they reviewed his other acts, in whatever on any occasion he had lived beyond the established usages; and especially, that on the tripod at Delphi, which the Greeks dedicated as the first-fruits of the spoil of the Medes, he had formerly on his own individual responsibility presumed to have the following distich inscribed:—

1.132.2
831
Ἑλλήνων ἀρχηγὸς ἐπεὶ στρατὸν ὤλεσε Μήδων, Παυσανίας Φοίβῳ μνῆμ’ ἀνέθηκε τόδε.  
"The Greeks' commander, having destroyed the Medes' force, Pausanias dedicated this memorial to Phoebus."

1.132.3
832
τὸ μὲν οὖν ἐλεγεῖον οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐξεκόλαψαν εὐθὺς τότε ἀπὸ τοῦ τρίποδος τοῦτο καὶ ἐπέγραψαν ὀνομαστὶ τὰς πόλεις ὅσαι ξυγκαθελοῦσαι τὸν βάρβαρον ἔστησαν τὸ ἀνάθημα.
The Lacedaemonians immediately erased this elegy from the tripod and inscribed the names of the cities that had joined together to overthrow the barbarian and set up the offering.

1.132.3
833
τοῦ μέντοι Παυσανίου ἀδίκημα καὶ τότ' ἐδόκει εἶναι, καὶ ἐπεί γε δὴ ἐν τούτῳ καθειστήκει, πολλῷ μᾶλλον παρόμοιον πραχθῆναι ἐφαίνετο τῇ παρούσῃ διανοίᾳ.
Indeed, Pausanias' act was considered to be wrong at that time, and since he had put himself in his present position, it appeared even more likely to have been done in accordance with his current mindset.

1.132.4
834
ἐπυνθάνοντο δὲ καὶ ἐς τοὺς Εἵλωτας πράσσειν τι αὐτόν, καὶ ἦν δὲ οὕτως·
They also learned that he was dealing with the Helots, and it was indeed so;

1.132.4
835
ἐλευθέρωσίν τε γὰρ ὑπισχνεῖτο αὐτοῖς καὶ πολιτείαν, ἢν ξυνεπαναστῶσι καὶ τὸ πᾶν ξυγκατεργάσωνται.
for he was promising them freedom and citizenship, if they would rise up with him and participate in his entire plan.

1.132.5
836
ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ὣς οὐδὲ τῶν Εἱλώτων μηνυταῖς τισὶ πιστεύσαντες ἠξίωσαν νεώτερόν τι ποιεῖν ἐς αὐτόν, χρώμενοι τῷ τρόπῳ ᾧπερ εἰώθασιν ἐς σφᾶς αὐτούς, μὴ ταχεῖς εἶναι περὶ ἀνδρὸς Σπαρτιάτου ἄνευ ἀναμφισβητήτων τεκμηρίων βουλεῦσαί τι ἀνήκεστον, πρίν γε δὴ αὐτοῖς, ὡς λέγεται, ὁ μέλλων τὰς τελευταίας βασιλεῖ ἐπιστολὰς πρὸς Ἀρτάβαζον κομιεῖν, ἀνὴρ Ἀργίλιος, παιδικά ποτε ὢν αὐτοῦ καὶ πιστότατος ἐκείνῳ, μηνυτὴς γίγνεται, δείσας κατὰ ἐνθύμησίν τινα ὅτι οὐδείς πω τῶν πρὸ ἑαυτοῦ ἀγγέλων πάλιν ἀφίκετο, καὶ παρασημηνάμενος σφραγῖδα, ἵνα, ἢν ψευσθῇ τῆς δόξης ἢ καὶ ἐκεῖνός τι μεταγράψαι αἰτήσῃ, μὴ ἐπιγνῷ, λύει τὰς ἐπιστολάς, ἐν αἷς ὑπονοήσας τι τοιοῦτον προσεπεστάλθαι καὶ αὑτὸν ηὗρεν ἐγγεγραμμένον κτείνειν.
Yet, even then, they did not trust any of the Helots who informed against him and did not wish to take extreme measures against a Spartan without irrefutable evidence, until, as it is said, a man from Argilus, who was about to carry the final letters for the king to Artabazus, previously a favorite and very trusted by Pausanias, became an informer. He was alarmed by the suspicion that none of the messengers before him had returned, and, counterfeiting the seal so that if he was mistaken or if Pausanias asked to alter the writing, it would not be discovered, he opened the letters, in which he found, as he suspected, an additional order to kill him.

1.133.1
837
τότε δὴ οἱ ἔφοροι δείξαντος αὐτοῦ τὰ γράμματα μᾶλλον μὲν ἐπίστευσαν , αὐτήκοοι δὲ βουληθέντες ἔτι γενέσθαι αὐτοῦ Παυσανίου τι λέγοντος , ἀπὸ παρασκευῆς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐπὶ Ταίναρον ἱκέτου οἰχομένου καὶ σκηνησαμένου διπλῆν διαφράγματι καλύβην , ἐς ἣν τῶν τε ἐφόρων ἐντός τινας ἔκρυψε , καὶ Παυσανίου ὡς αὐτὸν ἐλθόντος καὶ ἐρωτῶντος τὴν πρόφασιν τῆς ἱκετείας ᾔσθοντο πάντα σαφῶς , αἰτιωμένου τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τά τε περὶ αὐτοῦ γραφέντα καὶ τ- ἄλλʼ ἀποφαίνοντος καθ’ ἕκαστον , ὡς οὐδὲν πώποτε αὐτὸν ἐν ταῖς πρὸς βασιλέα διακονίαις παραβάλοιτο , προτιμηθείη δ’ ἐν ἴσῳ τοῖς πολλοῖς τῶν διακόνων ἀποθανεῖν , κ- ἐκείνου αὐτά τε ταῦτα ξυνομολογοῦντος καὶ περὶ τοῦ παρόντος οὐκ ἐῶντος ὀργίζεσθαι , ἀλλὰ πίστιν ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ διδόντος τῆς ἀναστάσεως καὶ ἀξιοῦντος ὡς τάχιστα πορεύεσθαι καὶ μὴ τὰ πρασσόμενα διακωλύειν .
Then, however, the ephors, on his showing them the letter, gave greater credence to it; but still wished to be ear-witnesses of Pausanias' saying something. When therefore, from a concerted plan, the man had gone to Taenarus as a suppliant, and had built himself a hut, divided into two by a partition wall, in which he concealed some of the ephors; and when Pausanias came to him, and asked the reason for his becoming a suppliant, they heard all distinctly; while the man charged him with what had been written, and set forth the other particulars, one by one, saying that he had never yet endangered him at all in his services with respect to the king, yet had been, just like the mass of his servants, preferred to death; and Pausanias acknowledged these very things, and desired him not to be angry for what had happened, but gave him the security of raising him up from the temple, and begged him to go as quickly as possible, and not to put an obstacle in the way of his designs.

1.134.1
838
ἀκούσαντες δὲ ἀκριβῶς τότε μὲν ἀπῆλθον οἱ ἔφοροι, βεβαίως δὲ ἤδη εἰδότες ἐν τῇ πόλει τὴν ξύλληψιν ἐποιοῦντο.
After hearing the conversation in detail, the ephors departed, but now having certain knowledge, they prepared for his arrest in the city.

1.134.1
839
λέγεται δ’ αὐτὸν μέλλοντα ξυλληφθήσεσθαι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ἑνὸς μὲν τῶν ἐφόρων τὸ πρόσωπον προσιόντος ὡς εἶδε, γνῶναι ἐφ’ ᾧ ἐχώρει, ἄλλου δὲ νεύματι ἀφανεῖ χρησαμένου καὶ δηλώσαντος εὐνοίᾳ πρὸς τὸ ἱερὸν τῆς Χαλκιοίκου χωρῆσαι δρόμῳ καὶ προκαταφυγεῖν.
It is said that when he was about to be arrested in the street, seeing the face of one of the ephors approaching, he realized what was happening. Another ephor, using a secret signal, indicated out of goodwill that he should flee to the sanctuary of Minerva of the Brazen-House, and he ran and took refuge there first.

1.134.1
840
ἦν δ’ ἐγγὺς τὸ τέμενος.
The sanctuary was nearby.

1.134.1
841
καὶ ἐς οἴκημα οὐ μέγα ὃ ἦν τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἐσελθών, ἵνα μὴ ὑπαίθριος ταλαιπωροίη, ἡσύχαζεν.
He entered a small building that was part of the temple, to avoid suffering in the open air, and stayed there quietly.

1.134.2
842
οἱ δὲ τὸ παραυτίκα μὲν ὑστέρησαν τῇ διώξει, μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο τοῦ τε οἰκήματος τὸν ὄροφον ἀφεῖλον καὶ τὰς θύρας ἔνδον ὄντα τηρήσαντες αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπολαβόντες ἔσω ἀπῳκοδόμησαν, προσκαθεζόμενοί τε ἐξεπολιόρκησαν λιμῷ.
Initially, the ephors were delayed in their pursuit. However, subsequently, they removed the roof of the building and, watching him inside, they cut off his exit, rebuilt the barricades, and then, sitting outside, they starved him out.

1.134.3
843
καὶ μέλλοντος αὐτοῦ ἀποψύχειν ὥσπερ εἶχεν ἐν τῷ οἰκήματι, αἰσθόμενοι ἐξάγουσιν ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἔτι ἔμπνουν ὄντα, καὶ ἐξαχθεὶς ἀπέθανε παραχρῆμα.
When they realized he was on the verge of dying inside the building, they brought him out of the temple while he was still breathing. Once taken out, he died immediately.

1.134.4
844
καὶ αὐτὸν ἐμέλλησαν μὲν ἐς τὸν Καιάδαν οὗπερ τοὺς κακούργους ἐσβάλλειν, ἔπειτα ἔδοξε πλησίον που κατορύξαι.
They intended to throw his body into the Caeadas, where they dispose of criminals, but later decided to bury him somewhere nearby.

1.134.4
845
ὁ δὲ θεὸς ὁ ἐν Δελφοῖς τόν τε τάφον ὕστερον ἔχρησε τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις μετενεγκεῖν οὗπερ ἀπέθανε (καὶ νῦν κεῖται ἐν τῷ προτεμενίσματι, ὃ γραφῇ στῆλαι δηλοῦσι) καὶ ὡς ἄγος αὐτοῖς ὂν τὸ πεπραγμένον δύο σώματα ἀνθ’ ἑνὸς τῇ Χαλκιοίκῳ ἀποδοῦναι.
Later, the god at Delphi decreed that the Spartans should move his tomb to the place where he died (and now it lies in the forecourt, as inscription columns indicate) and that, as the act was a pollution, they should offer two bodies instead of one to Minerva of the Brazen-House.

1.134.4
846
οἱ δὲ ποιησάμενοι χαλκοῦς ἀνδριάντας δύο ὡς ἀντὶ Παυσανίου ἀνέθεσαν.
Then, having made two bronze statues as a substitute for Pausanias, they dedicated them.

1.134.4
847
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι, ὡς καὶ τοῦ θεοῦ ἄγος κρίναντος, ἀντεπέταξαν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐλαύνειν αὐτό.
The Athenians, in response to the god having judged it a pollution, countered the Lacedaemonians to drive it out.

1.135.1
848
τοῦ δὲ μηδισμοῦ τοῦ Παυσανίου οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι πρέσβεις πέμψαντες παρὰ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ξυνεπῃτιῶντο καὶ τὸν Θεμιστοκλέα, ὡς ηὕρισκον ἐκ τῶν περὶ Παυσανίαν ἐλέγχων, ἠξίουν τε τοῖς αὐτοῖς κολάζεσθαι αὐτόν.
The Lacedaemonians sent ambassadors to the Athenians to join in petitioning against Themistocles, as they found from the investigations around Pausanias, demanding he be punished in the same way.

1.135.2
849
οἱ δὲ πεισθέντες (ἔτυχε γὰρ ὠστρακισμένος καὶ ἔχων δίαιταν μὲν ἐν Ἄργει, ἐπιφοιτῶν δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν ἄλλην Πελοπόννησον) πέμπουσι μετὰ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἑτοίμων ὄντων ξυνδιώκειν ἄνδρας οἷς εἴρητο ἄγειν ὅπου ἂν περιτύχωσιν.
The Athenians, being convinced (since Themistocles was already ostracized and residing at Argos, but visiting the rest of Peloponnese), sent men along with the ready Lacedaemonians to pursue him and to bring him wherever they might find him.

1.135.3
850
ὁ δὲ Θεμιστοκλῆς τότε παρὰ βασιλέα Περσῶν ὢν καὶ ἀκούσας ἐπὶ ταῦτα ἐπεχείρει ἔχων τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐκείνου ἐκ τῶν πόλεων τὰς φόρους ἐκλέγων, καὶ ἐν Μαγνησίᾳ τῇ ἐν Σισπύρῳ τότε διαίτην ἔχων, καὶ ἐνταῦθα διακονοῦντος αὐτῷ Ἀργιλίου τινὸς ἀνδρὸς ὅστις ἐξέτεινε τὸν λόγον ἐς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους, καὶ μαθὼν ὅτι καταληφθεὶς καὶ ἐπὶ βασιλέα κομισθεὶς ἐκδοθήσεται, ἐπιστολὴν ἀποστέλλει ἐπ’ Ἀθήνας πρὸς τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐχθροὺς ἑαυτοῦ ὧδε λέγων:
At that time, Themistocles was with the Persian king, overseeing the collection of taxes from the cities under his authority, and was residing in Magnesia on the Sipylus. He was served by a certain Argilian man, who conveyed the information to the Lacedaemonians. Learning that he would be captured and handed over to the king, Themistocles sent a letter to his enemies in Athens, stating:

1.136.1
851
ὁ δὲ Θεμιστοκλῆς προαισθόμενος φεύγει ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ἐς Κέρκυραν, ὢν αὐτῶν εὐεργέτης.
Themistocles, foreseeing his predicament, fled from the Peloponnese to Corcyra, as he had been their benefactor.

1.136.1
852
δεδιέναι δὲ φασκόντων Κερκυραίων ἔχειν αὐτὸν ὥστε Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις ἀπεχθέσθαι, διακομίζεται ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον τὴν καταντικρύ.
However, the Corcyraeans expressed fear of harboring him due to the potential enmity of the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, so they transported him to the mainland opposite.

1.136.2
853
καὶ διωκόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν προστεταγμένων κατὰ πύστιν ᾗ χωροίη, ἀναγκάζεται κατά τι ἄπορον παρὰ Ἄδμητον τὸν Μολοσσῶν βασιλέα ὄντα αὐτῷ οὐ φίλον καταλῦσαι.
Pursued by those assigned to track him, Themistocles was forced to seek refuge with Admetus, the king of the Molossians, with whom he was not on friendly terms.

1.136.3
854
καὶ ὁ μὲν οὐκ ἔτυχεν ἐπιδημῶν, ὁ δὲ τῆς γυναικὸς ἱκέτης γενόμενος διδάσκεται ὑπ’ αὐτῆς τὸν παῖδα σφῶν λαβὼν καθέζεσθαι ἐπὶ τὴν ἑστίαν.
Admetus was not present, but Themistocles, becoming a supplicant to Admetus's wife, was instructed by her to take their child and sit at the hearth.

1.136.4
855
καὶ ἐλθόντος οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον τοῦ Ἀδμήτου δηλοῖ τε ὅς ἐστι καὶ οὐκ ἀξιοῖ, εἴ τι ἄρα αὐτὸς ἀντεῖπεν αὐτῷ Ἀθηναίων δεομένῳ, φεύγοντα τιμωρεῖσθαι.
Upon Admetus's return, Themistocles revealed his identity and pleaded not to be punished for past disputes, especially as he was in a much weaker position now.

1.136.4
856
καὶ γὰρ ἂν ὑπ’ ἐκείνου πολλῷ ἀσθενεστέρου ἐν τῷ παρόντι κακῶς πάσχει

1.136.4
857
καὶ ἅμα αὐτὸς μὲν ἐκείνῳ χρείας τινὸς καὶ οὐκ ἐς τὸ σῶμα σῴζεσθαι ἐναντιωθῆναι, ἐκεῖνον δ’ ἄν, εἰ ἐκδοίη αὐτόν (εἰπὼν ὑφ’ ὧν καὶ ἐφ’ ᾧ διώκεται), σωτηρίας ἂν τῆς ψυχῆς ἀποστερῆσαι.
He noted that while he had opposed Admetus on some matter, it was not a matter of life preservation, whereas, if Admetus handed him over (mentioning by whom and for what he was being pursued), it would deprive him of his life's safety.

1.137.1
858
ὁ δὲ ἀκούσας ἀνίστησί τε αὐτὸν μετὰ τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ υἱέος, ὥσπερ καὶ ἔχων αὐτὸν ἐκαθέζετο, καὶ μέγιστον ἦν ἱκέτευμα τοῦτο, καὶ ὕστερον οὐ πολλῷ τοῖς τε Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις ἐλθοῦσι καὶ πολλὰ εἰποῦσιν οὐκ ἐκδίδωσιν, ἀλλ’ ἀποστέλλει βουλόμενον ὡς βασιλέα πορευθῆναι ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτέραν θάλασσαν πεζῇ ἐς Πύδναν τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου.
Admetus, after hearing his plea, raised him up along with his son, as he was sitting with him, which was a significant act of supplication. Later, when the Lacedaemonians and Athenians arrived and made their case, Admetus did not surrender him, but instead sent him on foot to Pydna on the other sea, in the territory of Alexander.

1.137.2
859
ἐν ᾗ ὁλκάδος τυχὼν ἀναγομένης ἐπ’ Ἰωνίας καὶ ἐπιβὰς καταφέρεται χειμῶνι ἐς τὸ Ἀθηναίων στρατόπεδον, ὃ ἐπολιόρκει Νάξον.
There he happened upon a merchant ship bound for Ionia; boarding it, he was driven by a storm to the Athenian camp, which was besieging Naxos.

1.137.2
860
καί (ἦν γὰρ ἀγνὼς τοῖς ἐν τῇ νηί) δείσας φράζει τῷ ναυκλήρῳ ὅστις ἐστὶ καὶ δι’ ἃ φεύγει, καὶ εἰ μὴ σώσει αὐτόν, ἔφη ἐρεῖν ὅτι χρήμασι πεισθεὶς αὐτὸν ἄγει.
As he was unrecognized by those on the ship, out of fear, he informed the captain of who he was and the reason for his flight, warning that if he did not save him, he would claim that the captain was transporting him for a bribe.

1.137.2
861
τὴν δὲ ἀσφάλειαν εἶναι μηδένα ἐκβῆναι ἐκ τῆς νεὼς μέχρι πλοῦς γένηται.
The safest course, he advised, was for no one to disembark from the ship until they could continue their voyage.

1.137.2
862
πειθομένῳ δ’ αὐτῷ χάριν ἀπομνήσεσθαι ἀξίαν.
He promised the captain that if he complied, he would be duly rewarded.

1.137.2
863
ὁ δὲ ναύκληρος ποιεῖ τε ταῦτα καὶ ἀποσαλεύσας ἡμέραν καὶ νύκτα ὑπὲρ τοῦ στρατοπέδου ὕστερον ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Ἔφεσον.
The captain complied with these requests, and after sailing day and night beyond the camp, he later arrived at Ephesus.

1.137.3
864
καὶ ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς ἐκεῖνόν τε ἐθεράπευσε χρημάτων δόσει (ἦλθε γὰρ αὐτῷ ὕστερον ἔκ τε Ἀθηνῶν παρὰ τῶν φίλων καὶ ἐξ Ἄργους ἃ ὑπεξέκειτο) καὶ μετὰ τῶν κάτω Περσῶν τινὸς πορευθεὶς ἄνω ἐσπέμπει γράμματα πρὸς βασιλέα Ἀρταξέρξην τὸν Ξέρξου νεωστὶ βασιλεύοντα.
And Themistocles rewarded him by a present of money (for there came to him afterwards money from Athens, sent by his friends, and from Argos that which had been secretly laid up there): and having gone up the country with one of the Persians on the coast, he sent a letter to king Artaxerxes, the son of Xerxes, who was lately come to the throne.

1.137.4
865
ἐδήλου δὲ ἡ γραφὴ ὅτι "Θεμιστοκλῆς ἥκω παρὰ σέ, ὃς κακὰ μὲν πλεῖστα Ἑλλήνων εἴργασμαι τὸν ὑμέτερον οἶκον, ὅσον χρόνον τὸν σὸν πατέρα ἐπιόντα ἐμοὶ ἀνάγκῃ ἠμυνόμην, πολὺ δ’ ἔτι πλείω ἀγαθά, ἐπειδὴ ἐν τῷ ἀσφαλεῖ μὲν ἐμοί, ἐκείνῳ δὲ ἐν ἐπικινδύνῳ πάλιν ἡ ἀποκομιδὴ ἐγίγνετο.
The purport of the letter was this: I Themistocles am come to thee, who have done most harm of all the Greeks to your house, as long as I was compelled to defend myself against thy father who had attacked me, but still far more good, when he was retreating in circumstances of safety to me, but of peril to him.

1.137.4
866
καί μοι εὐεργεσία ὀφείλεται (γράψας τήν τε ἐκ Σαλαμῖνος προάγγελσιν τῆς ἀναχωρήσεως καὶ τὴν τῶν γεφυρῶν, ἣν ψευδῶς προσεποιήσατο, τότε δι’ αὑτὸν οὐ διάλυσιν), καὶ νῦν ἔχων σε μεγάλα ἀγαθὰ δρᾶσαι πάρειμι διωκόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων διὰ τὴν σὴν φιλίαν.
And return for a benefit is owed me; and now I am come with power to do thee great good, being persecuted by the Greeks because of my friendship for thee.

1.137.4
867
βούλομαι δ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἐπισχὼν αὐτός σοι περὶ ὧν ἥκω δηλῶσαι " .
But I wish to wait a year, and then explain in person to thee the objects of my coming.

1.138.1
868
βασιλεὺς δέ , ὡς λέγεται , ἐθαύμασέ τε αὐτοῦ τὴν διάνοιαν καὶ ἐκέλευε ποιεῖν οὕτως .
The king, it is said, approved of his plan, and told him to do so.

1.138.1
869
ὁ δ’ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ ὃν ἐπέσχε τῆς τε Περσίδος γλώσσης ὅσα ἐδύνατο κατενόησε καὶ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων τῆς χώρας ·
During the time that he waited he learnt as much as he could of the Persian language, and the institutions of the country;

1.138.2
870
ἀφικόμενος δὲ μετὰ τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν γίγνεται παρ’ αὐτῷ μέγας καὶ ὅσος οὐδείς πω Ἑλλήνων διά τε τὴν προϋπάρχουσαν ἀξίωσιν καὶ τοῦ Ἑλληνικοῦ ἐλπίδα , ἣν ὑπετίθει αὐτῷ δουλώσειν , μάλιστα δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ πεῖραν διδοὺς ξυνετὸς φαίνεσθαι .
and having gone to him after the expiration of the year, he became an influential person with him, so as none of the Greeks had hitherto been, both on account of his previous reputation, and the hope which he suggested with regard to Greece, namely, that he would make it subject to him; but most of all, from his showing himself talented by actual proofs.

1.138.3
871
ἦν γὰρ ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς βεβαιότατα δὴ φύσεως ἰσχὺν δηλώσας καὶ διαφερόντως τι ἐς αὐτὸ μᾶλλον ἑτέρου ἄξιος θαυμάσαι ·
For Themistocles was one who most clearly displayed the strength of natural genius, and was particularly worthy of admiration in this respect, more than any other man:

1.138.3
872
οἰκείᾳ γὰρ ξυνέσει καὶ οὔτε προμαθὼν ἐς αὐτὴν οὐδὲν οὔτ’ ἐπιμαθών , τῶν τε παραχρῆμα δι’ ἐλαχίστης βουλῆς κράτιστος γνώμων καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ἐπὶ πλεῖστον τοῦ γενησομένου ἄριστος εἰκαστής ·
for by his own talent, and without learning any thing towards it before, or in addition to it, he was both the best judge of things present with the least deliberation, and the best conjecturer of the future, to the most remote point of what was likely to happen.

1.138.3
873
καὶ ἃ μὲν μετὰ χεῖρας ἔχοι , καὶ ἐξηγήσασθαι οἷός τε , ὧν δ’ ἄπειρος εἴη , κρῖναι ἱκανῶς οὐκ ἀπήλλακτο ·
Moreover, the things which he took in hand he was also able to carry out; and in those in which he had no experience he was not at a loss [*] to form a competent judgment.

1.138.3
874
τό τε ἄμεινον ἢ χεῖρον ἐν τῷ ἀφανεῖ ἔτι προεώρα μάλιστα .
He had too the greatest foresight of what was the better course or the worse in what was as yet unseen.

1.138.3
875
καὶ τὸ ξύμπαν εἰπεῖν φύσεως μὲν δυνάμει , μελέτης δὲ βραχύτητι κράτιστος δὴ οὗτος αὐτοσχεδιάζειν τὰ δέοντα ἐγένετο .
In a word, by strength of natural talent, and shortness of study, he was the best of all men to do [*] off-hand what was necessary.

1.138.4
876
νοσήσας δὲ τελευτᾷ τὸν βίον ·
He ended his life by disease;

1.138.4
877
λέγουσι δέ τινες καὶ ἑκούσιον φαρμάκῳ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτόν , ἀδύνατον νομίσαντα εἶναι ἐπιτελέσαι βασιλεῖ ἃ ὑπέσχετο .
though some say that he purposely destroyed himself by poison, on finding that he was unable to perform what he had promised to the king.

1.138.5
878
μνημεῖον μὲν οὖν αὐτοῦ ἐν Μαγνησίᾳ ἐστὶ τῇ Ἀσιανῇ ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ·
Now there is a monument to him in the Asiatic Magnesia, in the market-place;

1.138.5
879
ταύτης γὰρ ἦρχε τῆς χώρας , δόντος βασιλέως αὐτῷ Μαγνησίαν μὲν ἄρτον , ἣ προσέφερε πεντήκοντα τάλαντα τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ , Λάμψακον δὲ οἶνον ( ἐδόκει γὰρ πολυοινότατον τῶν τότε εἶναι ) , Μυοῦντα δὲ ὄψον .
for he was governor of the country, the king having given him [*] Magnesia, which brought him in fifty talents a year, for bread, Lampsacus for wine, (for it was considered more productive of wine than any other place at that time,) and Myus for provisions [*] in general.

1.138.6
880
τὰ δὲ ὀστᾶ φασὶ κομισθῆναι αὐτοῦ οἱ προσήκοντες οἴκαδε κελεύσαντος ἐκείνου καὶ τεθῆναι κρύφα Ἀθηναίων ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ·
But his relations say that his bones were carried, by his own command, and laid in Attica without the knowledge of the Athenians;

1.138.6
881
οὐ γὰρ ἐξῆν θάπτειν ὡς ἐπὶ προδοσίᾳ φεύγοντος .
for it was not lawful to give them burial, as they were the bones of a man banished for treason.

1.138.6
882
τὰ μὲν κατὰ Παυσανίαν τὸν Λακεδαιμόνιον καὶ Θεμιστοκλέα τὸν Ἀθηναῖον , λαμπροτάτους γενομένους τῶν καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς Ἑλλήνων , οὕτως ἐτελεύτησεν .
Such was the end of Pausanias the Lacedaemonian, and Themistocles the Athenian, who had been the most distinguished of all the Greeks in their day.

1.139.1
883
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ ἐπὶ μὲν τῆς πρώτης πρεσβείας τοιαῦτα ἐπέταξάν τε καὶ ἀντεκελεύσθησαν περὶ τῶν ἐναγῶν τῆς ἐλάσεως ·
On the occasion then of their first embassy the Lacedaemonians gave orders to this effect, and received commands in return about driving out the accursed.

1.139.1
884
ὕστερον δὲ φοιτῶντες παρ’ Ἀθηναίους Ποτειδαίας τε ἀπανίστασθαι ἐκέλευον καὶ Αἴγιναν αὐτόνομον ἀφιέναι , καὶ μάλιστά γε πάντων καὶ ἐνδηλότατα προύλεγον τὸ περὶ Μεγαρέων ψήφισμα καθελοῦσι μὴ ἂν γίγνεσθαι πόλεμον , ἐν ᾧ εἴρητο αὐτοὺς μὴ χρῆσθαι τοῖς λιμέσι τοῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀθηναίων ἀρχῇ μηδὲ τῇ Ἀττικῇ ἀγορᾷ .
But on going subsequently to the Athenians, they commanded them to raise the siege of Potidaea, and leave, Aegina independent; and declared, most especially and distinctly of all, that there would be no war, if they rescinded the decree respecting the Megareans, in which it had been declared that they should not use the ports in the Athenian empire, or the Attic market.

1.139.2
885
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι οὔτε τ- ἄλλα ὑπήκουον οὔτε τὸ ψήφισμα καθῄρουν , ἐπικαλοῦντες ἐπεργασίαν Μεγαρεῦσι τῆς γῆς τῆς ἱερᾶς καὶ τῆς ἀορίστου καὶ ἀνδραπόδων ὑποδοχὴν τῶν ἀφισταμένων .
But the Athenians were neither disposed to obey them in the other points nor to rescind the decree; as they charged the Megareans with an encroaching cultivation of the consecrated and unenclosed land, and with receiving the run-away slaves.

1.139.3
886
τέλος δὲ ἀφικομένων τῶν τελευταίων πρέσβεων ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος , Ῥαμφίου τε καὶ Μελησίππου καὶ Ἀγησάνδρου , καὶ λεγόντων ἄλλο μὲν οὐδὲν ὧν πρότερον εἰώθεσαν , αὐτὰ δὲ τάδε ὅτι
Finally, when the last ambassadors had come from Lacedaemonians, namely, Ramphias, Melesippus, and Agesander, and mentioned none of the things which they usually had before, but simply this,

1.139.4
887
καὶ παριόντες ἄλλοι τε πολλοὶ ἔλεγον ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα γιγνόμενοι ταῖς γνώμαις καὶ ὡς χρὴ πολεμεῖν καὶ ὡς μὴ ἐμπόδιον εἶναι τὸ ψήφισμα εἰρήνης , ἀλλὰ καθελεῖν , καὶ παρελθὼν Περικλῆς ὁ Ξανθίππου , ἀνὴρ κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον πρῶτος Ἀθηναίων , λέγειν τε καὶ πράσσειν δυνατώτατος , παρῄνει τοιάδε .
And many others came forward and spoke, supporting both views of the question; both that they should go to war, and that the decree should not be an obstacle to peace, but that they should rescind it: and then came forward Pericles, the son of Xanthippus, the first man of the Athenians at that time, and most able both in speaking and acting, and advised them as follows.

1.140.1
888
"τῆς μὲν γνώμης , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , αἰεὶ τῆς αὐτῆς ἔχομαι , μὴ εἴκειν Πελοποννησίοις , καίπερ εἰδὼς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους οὐ τῇ αὐτῇ ὀργῇ ἀναπειθομένους τε πολεμεῖν καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ πράσσοντας , πρὸς δὲ τὰς ξυμφορὰς καὶ τὰς γνώμας τρεπομένους .
"I always adhere to the same opinion, Athenians, that we should make no concessions to the Lacedaemonians; although I know that men are not persuaded to go to war, and act when engaged in it, with the same temper; but that, according to results, they also change their views.

1.140.1
889
ὁρῶ δὲ καὶ νῦν ὁμοῖα καὶ παραπλήσια ξυμβουλευτέα μοι ὄντα , καὶ τοὺς ἀναπειθομένους ὑμῶν δικαιῶ τοῖς κοινῇ δόξασιν , ἢν ἄρα τι καὶ σφαλλώμεθα , βοηθεῖν , ἢ μηδὲ κατορθοῦντας τῆς ξυνέσεως μεταποιεῖσθαι .
Still I see that the same advice, or nearly the same, must be given by me now as before; and I claim from those of you who are being persuaded to war, that you will support the common resolutions, should we ever meet with any reverse; or not, on the other hand, to lay any claim to intelligence, if successful.

1.140.1
890
ἐνδέχεται γὰρ τὰς ξυμφορὰς τῶν πραγμάτων οὐχ ἧσσον ἀμαθῶς χωρῆσαι ἢ καὶ τὰς διανοίας τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ·
For it frequently happens that the results of measures proceed no less incomprehensibly than the counsels of man;

1.140.1
891
δι’ ὅπερ καὶ τὴν τύχην , ὅσα ἂν παρὰ λόγον ξυμβῇ , εἰώθαμεν αἰτιᾶσθαι .
and therefore we are accustomed to regard fortune as the author of all things that turn out contrary to our expectation.

1.140.2
892
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ πρότερόν τε δῆλοι ἦσαν ἐπιβουλεύοντες ἡμῖν καὶ νῦν οὐχ ἥκιστα .
Now the Lacedaemonians were both evidently plotting against us before, and now especially are doing so.

1.140.2
893
εἰρημένον γὰρ δίκας μὲν τῶν διαφορῶν ἀλλήλοις διδόναι καὶ δέχεσθαι , ἔχειν δὲ ἑκατέρους ἃ ἔχομεν , οὔτε αὐτοὶ δίκας πω ᾔτησαν οὔτε ἡμῶν διδόντων δέχονται , βούλονται δὲ πολέμῳ μᾶλλον ἢ λόγοις τὰ ἐγκλήματα διαλύεσθαι , καὶ ἐπιτάσσοντες ἤδη καὶ οὐκέτι αἰτιώμενοι πάρεισιν .
For whereas it is expressed in the treaty, that we should give and accept judicial decisions of our differences, and each side [in the mean time] keep what we have; they have neither themselves hitherto asked for such a decision, nor do they accept it when we offer it; but wish our complaints to be settled by war rather than by words; and are now come dictating, and no longer expostulating.

1.140.3
894
Ποτειδαίας τε γὰρ ἀπανίστασθαι κελεύουσι καὶ Αἴγιναν αὐτόνομον ἀφιέναι καὶ τὸ Μεγαρέων ψήφισμα καθαιρεῖν ·
For they command us to raise the siege of Potidaea, and to leave Aegina independent, and to rescind the decree respecting the Megareans;

1.140.3
895
οἱ δὲ τελευταῖοι οἵδε ἥκοντες καὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας προαγορεύουσιν αὐτονόμους ἀφιέναι .
while these last envoys that have come charge us also to leave the Greeks independent.

1.140.4
896
ὑμῶν δὲ μηδεὶς νομίσῃ περὶ βραχέος ἂν πολεμεῖν , εἰ τὸ Μεγαρέων ψήφισμα μὴ καθέλοιμεν , ὅπερ μάλιστα προύχονται , εἰ καθαιρεθείη , μὴ ἂν γίγνεσθαι τὸν πόλεμον , μηδὲ ἐν ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς αἰτίαν ὑπολίπησθε ὡς διὰ μικρὸν ἐπολεμήσατε .
But let none of you think that we should be going to war for a trifle, if we did not rescind the decree respecting the Megareans, which they principally put forward, [saying,] that if it were rescinded, the war would not take place: nor leave in your minds any room for self-accusation hereafter, as though you had gone to war for a trivial thing.

1.140.5
897
τὸ γὰρ βραχύ τι τοῦτο πᾶσαν ὑμῶν ἔχει τὴν βεβαίωσιν καὶ πεῖραν τῆς γνώμης .
For this trifle [*] involves the whole confirmation, as well as trial, of your purpose.

1.140.5
898
οἷς εἰ ξυγχωρήσετε , καὶ ἄλλο τι μεῖζον εὐθὺς ἐπιταχθήσεσθε ὡς φόβῳ καὶ τοῦτο ὑπακούσαντες ·
If you yield to these demands, you will soon also be ordered to do something greater, as having in this instance obeyed through fear:

1.140.5
899
ἀπισχυρισάμενοι δὲ σαφὲς ἂν καταστήσαιτε αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ὑμῖν μᾶλλον προσφέρεσθαι .
but by resolutely refusing you would prove clearly to them that they must treat with you more on an equal footing.

1.141.1
900
αὐτόθεν δὴ διανοήθητε ἢ ὑπακούειν πρίν τι βλαβῆναι , ἢ εἰ πολεμήσομεν , ὥσπερ ἔμοιγε ἄμεινον δοκεῖ εἶναι , καὶ ἐπὶ μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐπὶ βραχείᾳ ὁμοίως προφάσει μὴ εἴξοντες μηδὲ ξὺν φόβῳ ἕξοντες ἃ κεκτήμεθα ·
"Henceforth then make up your minds, either to submit before you are hurt, or, if we go to war, as I think is better, on important or trivial grounds alike to make no concession, nor to keep with fear what we have now acquired;

1.141.1
901
τὴν γὰρ αὐτὴν δύναται δούλωσιν ἥ τε μεγίστη καὶ ἐλαχίστη δικαίωσις ἀπὸ τῶν ὁμοίων πρὸ δίκης τοῖς πέλας ἐπιτασσομένη .
for both the greatest and the least demand from equals, imperiously urged on their neighbours previous to a judicial decision, amounts to the same degree of subjugation.

1.141.2
902
τὰ δὲ τοῦ πολέμου καὶ τῶν ἑκατέροις ὑπαρχόντων ὡς οὐκ ἀσθενέστερα ἕξομεν γνῶτε καθ’ ἕκαστον ἀκούοντες .
Now with regard to the war, and the means possessed by both parties, that we shall not be the weaker side, be convinced by hearing the particulars.

1.141.3
903
αὐτουργοί τε γάρ εἰσι Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οὔτε ἰδίᾳ οὔτ’ ἐν κοινῷ χρήματά ἐστιν αὐτοῖς , ἔπειτα χρονίων πολέμων καὶ διαποντίων ἄπειροι διὰ τὸ βραχέως αὐτοὶ ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους ὑπὸ πενίας ἐπιφέρειν .
The Peloponnesians are men who [*] cultivate their land themselves; and they have no money either in private or public funds. Then they are inexperienced in long and transmarine wars, as they only wage them with each other for a short time, owing to their poverty.

1.141.4
904
καὶ οἱ τοιοῦτοι οὔτε ναῦς πληροῦντες οὔτε πεζὰς στρατιὰς πολλάκις ἐκπέμπειν δύνανται , ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων τε ἅμα ἀπόντες καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν αὑτῶν δαπανῶντες καὶ προσέτι καὶ θαλάσσης εἰργόμενοι ·
And men of this description can neither [*] man fleets nor often send out land armaments; being at the same time absent from their private business, and spending from their own resource sand, moreover, being also shut out from the sea:

1.141.5
905
αἱ δὲ περιουσίαι τοὺς πολέμους μᾶλλον ἢ αἱ βίαιοι ἐσφοραὶ ἀνέχουσιν .
but it is super-abundant revenues that support wars, rather than compulsory contributions.

1.141.5
906
σώμασί τε ἑτοιμότεροι οἱ αὐτουργοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἢ χρήμασι πολεμεῖν , τὸ μὲν πιστὸν ἔχοντες ἐκ τῶν κινδύνων κἂν περιγενέσθαι , τὸ δὲ οὐ βέβαιον μὴ οὐ προαναλώσειν , ἄλλως τε κἂν παρὰ δόξαν , ὅπερ εἰκός , ὁ πόλεμος αὐτοῖς μηκύνηται .
And men who till the land themselves are more ready to wage war with their persons than with their money: feeling confident, with regard to the former, that they will escape from dangers; but not being sure, with regard to the latter, that they will not spend it before they have done; especially should the war be prolonged beyond their expectation, as [in this case] it probably may.

1.141.6
907
μάχῃ μὲν γὰρ μιᾷ πρὸς ἅπαντας Ἕλληνας δυνατοὶ Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἀντισχεῖν , πολεμεῖν δὲ μὴ πρὸς ὁμοίαν ἀντιπαρασκευὴν ἀδύνατοι , ὅταν μήτε βουλευτηρίῳ ἑνὶ χρώμενοι παραχρῆμά τι ὀξέως ἐπιτελῶσι πάντες τε ἰσόψηφοι ὄντες καὶ οὐχ ὁμόφυλοι τὸ ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν ἕκαστος σπεύδῃ ·
For in one battle the Peloponnesians and their allies might cope with all the Greeks together; but they could not carry on a war against resources of a different description to their own; since they have no one board of council, so as to execute any measure with vigour; and all having equal votes, and not being of the same races, each forwards his own interest;

1.141.6
908
ἐξ ὧν φιλεῖ μηδὲν ἐπιτελὲς γίγνεσθαι .
for which reasons nothing generally is brought to completion.

1.141.7
909
καὶ γὰρ οἱ μὲν ὡς μάλιστα τιμωρήσασθαί τινα βούλονται , οἱ δὲ ὡς ἥκιστα τὰ οἰκεῖα φθεῖραι .
For some of them wish to avenge themselves as much as possible on some particular party; while others wish as little as possible to waste their own property.

1.141.7
910
χρόνιοί τε ξυνιόντες ἐν βραχεῖ μὲν μορίῳ σκοποῦσί τι τῶν κοινῶν , τῷ δὲ πλέονι τὰ οἰκεῖα πράσσουσι , καὶ ἕκαστος οὐ παρὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀμέλειαν οἴεται βλάψειν , μέλειν δέ τινι καὶ ἄλλῳ ὑπὲρ ἑαυτοῦ τι προϊδεῖν , ὥστε τῷ αὐτῷ ὑπὸ ἁπάντων ἰδίᾳ δοξάσματι λανθάνειν τὸ κοινὸν ἁθρόον φθειρόμενον .
And after being slow in coming together, it is but during a small part of the time that they look to any of the general interests, while during the greater part they are contriving for their own. And each individual does not imagine that he will do any harm by his own neglect, but thinks that it is the business of every one else too to look out for himself; so that through the same idea being individually entertained by all, the common cause is collectively sacrificed without their observing it.

1.142.1
911
μέγιστον δέ , τῇ τῶν χρημάτων σπάνει κωλύσονται , ὅταν σχολῇ αὐτὰ ποριζόμενοι διαμέλλωσιν ·
Most of all will they be impeded by scarcity of money, while, through their slowness in providing it, they continue to delay their operations;

1.142.1
912
τοῦ δὲ πολέμου οἱ καιροὶ οὐ μενετοί .
whereas the opportunities of war wait for no one.

1.142.2
913
καὶ μὴν οὐδ’ ἡ ἐπιτείχισις οὐδὲ τὸ ναυτικὸν αὐτῶν ἄξιον φοβηθῆναι .
Neither, again, is their raising works against us worth fearing, or their fleet.

1.142.3
914
τὴν μὲν γὰρ χαλεπὸν καὶ ἐν εἰρήνῃ πόλιν ἀντίπαλον κατασκευάσασθαι , ἦ που δὴ ἐν πολεμίᾳ τε καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον ἐκείνοις ἡμῶν ἀντεπιτετειχισμένων ·
With regard to the former, it were difficult even in time of peace to set up a rival city; much more in a hostile country, and when we should have raised works no less against them:

1.142.4
915
φρούριον δ’ εἰ ποιήσονται , τῆς μὲν γῆς βλάπτοιεν ἄν τι μέρος καταδρομαῖς καὶ αὐτομολίαις , οὐ μέντοι ἱκανόν γε ἔσται ἐπιτειχίζειν τε κωλύειν ἡμᾶς πλεύσαντας ἐς τὴν ἐκείνων καί , ᾗπερ ἰσχύομεν , ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀμύνεσθαι ·
and if they build [only] a fort, they might perhaps hurt some part of our land by incursions and [*] desertions; it will not, however, be possible for them to prevent our sailing to their country and raising forts, and retaliating with our ships, in which we are so strong.

1.142.5
916
πλέον γὰρ ἡμεῖς ἔχομεν τοῦ κατὰ γῆν ἐκ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ ἐμπειρίας ἢ ἐκεῖνοι ἐκ τοῦ κατ’ ἤπειρον ἐς τὰ ναυτικά .
For we have more advantage for land-service from our naval skill, than they have for naval matters from their skill by land.

1.142.6
917
τὸ δὲ τῆς θαλάσσης ἐπιστήμονας γενέσθαι οὐ ῥᾳδίως αὐτοῖς προσγενήσεται .
But to become skilful at sea will not easily be acquired by them.

1.142.7
918
οὐδὲ γὰρ ὑμεῖς μελετῶντες αὐτὸ εὐθὺς ἀπὸ τῶν Μηδικῶν ἐξείργασθέ πω ·
For not even have you, though practising from the very time of the Median war, brought it to perfection as yet;

1.142.7
919
πῶς δὴ ἄνδρες γεωργοὶ καὶ οὐ θαλάσσιοι , καὶ προσέτι οὐδὲ μελετῆσαι ἐασόμενοι διὰ τὸ ὑφ’ ἡμῶν πολλαῖς ναυσὶν αἰεὶ ἐφορμεῖσθαι , ἄξιον ἄν τι δρῷεν ;
how then shall men who are agriculturalists and not mariners, and, moreover, will not even be permitted to practise, from being always [*] observed by us with many ships, achieve any thing worth speaking of?

1.142.8
920
πρὸς μὲν γὰρ ὀλίγας ἐφορμούσας κἂν διακινδυνεύσειαν πλήθει τὴν ἀμαθίαν θρασύνοντες , πολλαῖς δὲ εἰργόμενοι ἡσυχάσουσι καὶ ἐν τῷ μὴ μελετῶντι ἀξυνετώτεροι ἔσονται καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ καὶ ὀκνηρότεροι .
Against a few ships observing them they might run the risk, encouraging their ignorance by their numbers; but when kept in check by many, they will remain quiet; and through not practising will be the less skilful, and therefore the more afraid.

1.142.9
921
τὸ δὲ ναυτικὸν τέχνης ἐστίν , ὥσπερ καὶ ἄλλο τι , καὶ οὐκ ἐνδέχεται , ὅταν τύχῃ , ἐκ παρέργου μελετᾶσθαι , ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον μηδὲν ἐκείνῳ πάρεργον ἄλλο γίγνεσθαι .
For naval service is a matter of art, like any thing else; and does not admit of being practised just when it may happen, as a by-work; but rather does not even allow of any thing else being a by-work to it.

1.143.1
922
εἴ τε καὶ κινήσαντες τῶν Ὀλυμπίασιν ἢ Δελφοῖς χρημάτων μισθῷ μείζονι πειρῷντο ἡμῶν ὑπολαβεῖν τοὺς ξένους τῶν ναυτῶν , μὴ ὄντων μὲν ἡμῶν ἀντιπάλων ἐσβάντων αὐτῶν τε καὶ τῶν μετοίκων δεινὸν ἂν ἦν ·
Even if they should take some of the funds at Olympia or Delphi, and endeavour, by higher pay, to rob us of our foreign sailors, that would be alarming, if we were not a match for them, by going on board ourselves and our resident aliens;

1.143.1
923
νῦν δὲ τόδε τε ὑπάρχει , καί , ὅπερ κράτιστον , κυβερνήτας ἔχομεν πολίτας καὶ τὴν ἄλλην ὑπηρεσίαν πλείους καὶ ἀμείνους ἢ ἅπασα ἡ ἄλλη Ἑλλάς .
but now this is the case; and, what is best of all, we have native steersmen, and crews at large, more numerous and better than all the rest of Greece.

1.143.2
924
καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ κινδύνῳ οὐδεὶς ἂν δέξαιτο τῶν ξένων τήν τε αὑτοῦ φεύγειν καὶ μετὰ τῆς ἥσσονος ἅμα ἐλπίδος ὀλίγων ἡμερῶν ἕνεκα μεγάλου μισθοῦ δόσεως ἐκείνοις ξυναγωνίζεσθαι .
And with the danger before them, none of the foreigners would consent to fly his country, and at the same time with less hope of success to join them in the struggle, for the sake of a few days' higher pay.

1.143.3
925
" καὶ τὰ μὲν Πελοποννησίων ἔμοιγε τοιαῦτα καὶ παραπλήσια δοκεῖ εἶναι , τὰ δὲ ἡμέτερα τούτων τε ὧνπερ ἐκείνοις ἐμεμψάμην ἀπηλλάχθαι καὶ ἄλλα οὐκ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου μεγάλα ἔχειν .
The circumstances of the Peloponnesians then seem, to me at least, to be of such or nearly such a character; while ours seem both to be free from the faults I have found in theirs, and to have other great advantages in more than an equal degree.

1.143.4
926
ἤν τε ἐπὶ τὴν χώραν ἡμῶν πεζῇ ἴωσιν , ἡμεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν ἐκείνων πλευσούμεθα , καὶ οὐκέτι ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου ἔσται Πελοποννήσου τε μέρος τι τμηθῆναι καὶ τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἅπασαν ·
Again, should they come by land against our country, we will sail against theirs; and [*] the loss will be greater for even a part of the Peloponnese to be ravaged, than for the whole of Attica.

1.143.4
927
οἱ μὲν γὰρ οὐχ ἕξουσιν ἄλλην ἀντιλαβεῖν ἀμαχεί , ἡμῖν δ’ ἐστὶ γῆ πολλὴ καὶ ἐν νήσοις καὶ κατ’ ἤπειρον ·
For they will not be able to obtain any land in its stead without fighting for it; while we have abundance, both in islands and on the mainland.

1.143.5
928
μέγα γὰρ τὸ τῆς θαλάσσης κράτος .
For great is the power of the sea.

1.143.5
929
σκέψασθε δέ ·
Moreover, consider it [in this point of view]:

1.143.5
930
εἰ γὰρ ἦμεν νησιῶται , τίνες ἂν ἀληπτότεροι ἦσαν ;
if we had been islanders, who would have been more impregnable?

1.143.5
931
καὶ νῦν χρὴ ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τούτου διανοηθέντας τὴν μὲν γῆν καὶ οἰκίας ἀφεῖναι , τῆς δὲ θαλάσσης καὶ πόλεως φυλακὴν ἔχειν , καὶ Πελοποννησίοις ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ὀργισθέντας πολλῷ πλέοσι μὴ διαμάχεσθαι ( κρατήσαντές τε γὰρ αὖθις οὐκ ἐλάσσοσι μαχούμεθα καὶ ἢν σφαλῶμεν , τὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων , ὅθεν ἰσχύομεν , προσαπόλλυται ·
And we ought, as it is, with views as near as possible to those of islanders, to [*] give up all thought of our land and houses, and keep watch over the sea and the city; and not, through being enraged on their account, to come to an engagement with the Peloponnesians, who are much more numerous; (for if we defeat them, we shall have to fight again with no fewer of them: and if we meet with a reverse, our allies are lost also;

1.143.5
932
οὐ γὰρ ἡσυχάσουσι μὴ ἱκανῶν ἡμῶν ὄντων ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς στρατεύειν ) , τήν τε ὀλόφυρσιν μὴ οἰκιῶν καὶ γῆς ποιεῖσθαι , ἀλλὰ τῶν σωμάτων ·
for they will not remain quiet if we are not able to lead our forces against them;) and we should make lamentation, not for the houses and land, but for the lives [that are lost];

1.143.5
933
οὐ γὰρ τάδε τοὺς ἄνδρας , ἀλλ’ οἱ ἄνδρες ταῦτα κτῶνται .
for it is not these things that gain men, but men that gain these things.

1.143.5
934
καὶ εἰ ᾤμην πείσειν ὑμᾶς , αὐτοὺς ἂν ἐξελθόντας ἐκέλευον αὐτὰ δῃῶσαι καὶ δεῖξαι Πελοποννησίοις ὅτι τούτων γε ἕνεκα οὐχ ὑπακούσεσθε .
And if I thought that I should persuade you, I would bid you go out yourselves and ravage them, and show the Peloponnesians that you will not submit to them for these things, at any rate.

1.144.1
935
πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα ἔχω ἐς ἐλπίδα τοῦ περιέσεσθαι , ἢν ἐθέλητε ἀρχήν τε μὴ ἐπικτᾶσθαι ἅμα πολεμοῦντες καὶ κινδύνους αὐθαιρέτους μὴ προστίθεσθαι ·
I have also many other grounds for hoping that we shall conquer, if you will avoid gaining additional dominion at the time of your being engaged in the war, and bringing on yourselves dangers of your own choosing;

1.144.1
936
μᾶλλον γὰρ πεφόβημαι τὰς οἰκείας ἡμῶν ἁμαρτίας ἢ τὰς τῶν ἐναντίων διανοίας .
for I am more afraid of our own mistakes than of the enemy's plans.

1.144.2
937
ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνα μὲν καὶ ἐν ἄλλῳ λόγῳ ἅμα τοῖς ἔργοις δηλωθήσεται ·
But those points shall be explained in another speech at the time of the events.

1.144.2
938
νῦν δὲ τούτοις ἀποκρινάμενοι ἀποπέμψωμεν , Μεγαρέας μὲν ὅτι ἐάσομεν ἀγορᾷ καὶ λιμέσι χρῆσθαι , ἢν καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ξενηλασίας μὴ ποιῶσι μήτε ἡμῶν μήτε τῶν ἡμετέρων ξυμμάχων ( οὔτε γὰρ ἐκεῖνο κωλύει ἐν ταῖς σπονδαῖς οὔτε τόδε ) , τὰς δὲ πόλεις ὅτι αὐτονόμους ἀφήσομεν , εἰ καὶ αὐτονόμους ἔχοντες ἐσπεισάμεθα , καὶ ὅταν κ- ἐκεῖνοι ταῖς ἑαυτῶν ἀποδῶσι πόλεσι μὴ σφίσι τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐπιτηδείως αὐτονομεῖσθαι , ἀλλ’ αὐτοῖς ἑκάστοις ὡς βούλονται ·
At the present time let us send these men away with this answer: that with regard to the Megareans, we will allow them to use our ports and market, if the Lacedaemonians also abstain from expelling foreigners, whether ourselves or our allies ( [*] for it forbids neither the one nor the other in the treaty): with regard to the states, that we will leave them independent, if we also held them as independent when we made the treaty; and when they too restore to the states a permission to be independent suitably to the interests, [*] not of the Lacedaemonians themselves, but of the several states, as they wish:

1.144.2
939
δίκας τε ὅτι ἐθέλομεν δοῦναι κατὰ τὰς ξυνθήκας , πολέμου δὲ οὐκ ἄρξομεν , ἀρχομένους δὲ ἀμυνούμεθα .
that we are willing to submit to judicial decision, according to the treaty: and that we will not commence hostilities, but will defend ourselves against those who do.

1.144.2
940
ταῦτα γὰρ δίκαια καὶ πρέποντα ἅμα τῇδε τῇ πόλει ἀποκρίνασθαι .
For this is both a right answer and a becoming one for the state to give.

1.144.3
941
εἰδέναι δὲ χρὴ ὅτι ἀνάγκη πολεμεῖν , ἢν δὲ ἑκούσιοι μᾶλλον δεχώμεθα , ἧσσον ἐγκεισομένους τοὺς ἐναντίους ἕξομεν , ἔκ τε τῶν μεγίστων κινδύνων ὅτι καὶ πόλει καὶ ἰδιώτῃ μέγισται τιμαὶ περιγίγνονται .
But you should know that go to war we must; and if we accept it willingly rather than not, we shall find the enemy less disposed to press us hard; and, moreover, that it is from the greatest hazards that the greatest honours also are gained, both by state and by individual.

1.144.4
942
οἱ γοῦν πατέρες ἡμῶν ὑποστάντες Μήδους καὶ οὐκ ἀπὸ τοσῶνδε ὁρμώμενοι , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα ἐκλιπόντες , γνώμῃ τε πλέονι ἢ τύχῃ καὶ τόλμῃ μείζονι ἢ δυνάμει τόν τε βάρβαρον ἀπεώσαντο καὶ ἐς τάδε προήγαγον αὐτά .
Our fathers, at any rate, by withstanding the Medes—though they did not begin with such resources [as we have], but had even abandoned what they had—and by counsel, more than by fortune, and by daring, more than by strength, beat off the barbarian, and advanced those resources to their present height.

1.144.4
943
ὧν οὐ χρὴ λείπεσθαι , ἀλλὰ τούς τε ἐχθροὺς παντὶ τρόπῳ ἀμύνεσθαι καὶ τοῖς ἐπιγιγνομένοις πειρᾶσθαι αὐτὰ μὴ ἐλάσσω παραδοῦναι " .
And we must not fall short of them; but must repel our enemies in every way, and endeavour to bequeath our power to our posterity no less [than we received it].

1.145.1
944
ὁ μὲν Περικλῆς τοιαῦτα εἶπεν , οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι νομίσαντες ἄριστα σφίσι παραινεῖν αὐτὸν ἐψηφίσαντο ἃ ἐκέλευε , καὶ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἀπεκρίναντο τῇ ἐκείνου γνώμῃ , καθ’ ἕκαστά τε ὡς ἔφρασε καὶ τὸ ξύμπαν , οὐδὲν κελευόμενοι ποιήσειν , δίκῃ δὲ κατὰ τὰς ξυνθήκας ἑτοῖμοι εἶναι διαλύεσθαι περὶ τῶν ἐγκλημάτων ἐπὶ ἴσῃ καὶ ὁμοίᾳ .
Pericles spoke to this effect; and the Athenians, thinking that he gave them the best advice, voted as he desired them, and answered the Lacedaemonians according to his views, both on the separate points, as he told them, and generally, that they would do nothing on command, but were ready to have their complaints settled by judicial decision, according to the treaty, on a fair and equal footing.

1.145.1
945
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου καὶ οὐκέτι ὕστερον ἐπρεσβεύοντο ·
So they went back home, and came on no more embassies afterwards.

1.146.1
946
αἰτίαι δὲ αὗται καὶ διαφοραὶ ἐγένοντο ἀμφοτέροις πρὸ τοῦ πολέμου , ἀρξάμεναι εὐθὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν Ἐπιδάμνῳ καὶ Κερκύρᾳ ·
These were the charges and differences that each side had before the war, beginning from the very time of the affairs at Epidamnus and Corcyra.

1.146.1
947
ἐπεμείγνυντο δὲ ὅμως ἐν αὐταῖς καὶ παρ’ ἀλλήλους ἐφοίτων ἀκηρύκτως μέν , ἀνυπόπτως δὲ οὔ ·
Nevertheless they continued to have intercourse during them, and to go to each other's country without any herald, though not without suspicion;

1.146.1
948
σπονδῶν γὰρ ξύγχυσις τὰ γιγνόμενα ἦν καὶ πρόφασις τοῦ πολεμεῖν .
for what was taking place served to break up the treaty, and was a pretext for war.

2.1.1
949
 ἄρχεται δὲ ὁ πόλεμος ἐνθένδε ἤδη Ἀθηναίων καὶ Πελοποννησίων καὶ τῶν ἑκατέροις ξυμμάχων , ἐν ᾧ οὔτε ἐπεμείγνυντο ἔτι ἀκηρυκτεὶ παρ’ ἀλλήλους καταστάντες τε ξυνεχῶς ἐπολέμουν ·
The war between the Athenians and Peloponnesians and their respective allies now begins from this period, at which they ceased from further intercourse with each other without a herald, and having once proceeded to hostilities, carried them on continuously;

2.1.1
950
 γέγραπται δὲ ἑξῆς ὡς ἕκαστα ἐγίγνετο κατὰ θέρος καὶ χειμῶνα .
and the history of it is written in order, as the several events happened, by summers and winters.

2.2.1
951
 τέσσαρα μὲν γὰρ καὶ δέκα ἔτη ἐνέμειναν αἱ τριακοντούτεις σπονδαὶ αἳ ἐγένοντο μετ’ Εὐβοίας ἅλωσιν ·
For the thirty years’ truce which was made after the reduction of Euboea lasted fourteen years;

2.2.1
952
 τῷ δὲ πέμπτῳ καὶ δεκάτῳ ἔτει , ἐπὶ Χρυσίδος ἐν Ἄργει τότε πεντήκοντα δυοῖν δέοντα ἔτη ἱερωμένης καὶ Αἰνησίου ἐφόρου ἐν Σπάρτῃ καὶ Πυθοδώρου ἔτι δύο μῆνας ἄρχοντος Ἀθηναίοις , μετὰ τὴν ἐν Ποτειδαίᾳ μάχην μηνὶ ἕκτῳ καὶ ἅμα ἦρι ἀρχομένῳ Θηβαίων ἄνδρες ὀλίγῳ πλείους τριακοσίων ( ἡγοῦντο δὲ αὐτῶν βοιωταρχοῦντες Πυθάγγελός τε ὁ Φυλείδου καὶ Διέμπορος ὁ Ὀνητορίδου ) ἐσῆλθον περὶ πρῶτον ὕπνον ξὺν ὅπλοις ἐς Πλάταιαν τῆς Βοιωτίας οὖσαν Ἀθηναίων ξυμμαχίδα .
but in the fifteenth year, when Chrysis was in the forty-eighth year of her priesthood at Argos, and Aenesias was ephor at Sparta, and Pythodorus had still two months to be archon at Athens; in the sixth month after the battle at Potidaea, and in the beginning of spring, rather more than three hundred men of the Thebans, (led by Pythangelus, son of Phylidas, and Diemporus, son of Onetorides, Boeotarchs,) about the first watch entered with their arms into Plataea, a town of Boeotia, which was in alliance with the Athenians.

2.2.2
953
 ἐπηγάγοντο δὲ καὶ ἀνέῳξαν τὰς πύλας Πλαταιῶν ἄνδρες , Ναυκλείδης τε καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ , βουλόμενοι ἰδίας ἕνεκα δυνάμεως ἄνδρας τε τῶν πολιτῶν τοὺς σφίσιν ὑπεναντίους διαφθεῖραι καὶ τὴν πόλιν Θηβαίοις προσποιῆσαι .
There were certain men of the Plataeans who called them in, and opened the gates to them, namely, Nauclides and his party, who wished, for the sake of their own power, to put to death those of the citizens who were opposed to them, and to put the city into the hands of the Thebans.

2.2.3
954
 ἔπραξαν δὲ ταῦτα δι’ Εὐρυμάχου τοῦ Λεοντιάδου , ἀνδρὸς Θηβαίων δυνατωτάτου .
They carried on these negotiations through Eurymachus, the son of Leontiades, a very influential person at Thebes.

2.2.3
955
 προϊδόντες γὰρ οἱ Θηβαῖοι ὅτι ἔσοιτο ὁ πόλεμος ἐβούλοντο τὴν Πλάταιαν αἰεὶ σφίσι διάφορον οὖσαν ἔτι ἐν εἰρήνῃ τε καὶ τοῦ πολέμου μήπω φανεροῦ καθεστῶτος προκαταλαβεῖν .
For the Thebans, foreseeing that the war would take place, wished to surprise Plataea, which had always been at variance with them, while it was still time of peace, and the war had not openly broken out.

2.2.3
956
 ᾗ καὶ ῥᾷον ἔλαθον ἐσελθόντες , φυλακῆς οὐ προκαθεστηκυίας .
And on this account, too, they entered the more easily without being observed, as no guard had been set before [the gates].

2.2.4
957
 θέμενοι δὲ ἐς τὴν ἀγορὰν τὰ ὅπλα τοῖς μὲν ἐπαγαγομένοις οὐκ ἐπείθοντο ὥστε εὐθὺς ἔργου ἔχεσθαι καὶ ἰέναι ἐπὶ τὰς οἰκίας τῶν ἐχθρῶν , γνώμην δ’ ἐποιοῦντο κηρύγμασί τε χρήσασθαι ἐπιτηδείοις καὶ ἐς ξύμβασιν μᾶλλον καὶ φιλίαν τὴν πόλιν ἀγαγεῖν ( καὶ ἀνεῖπεν ὁ κῆρυξ , εἴ τις βούλεται κατὰ τὰ πάτρια τῶν πάντων Βοιωτῶν ξυμμαχεῖν , τίθεσθαι παρ’ αὑτοὺς τὰ ὅπλα ) , νομίζοντες σφίσι ῥᾳδίως τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ προσχωρήσειν τὴν πόλιν .
After piling their arms in the market-place, they did not comply with the wish of those who called them in by immediately setting to work, and going to the houses of their adversaries; but determined to make a proclamation in friendly terms, and to bring the city to an agreement rather, and to friendship; and the herald proclaimed, that whoever wished to make alliance according to the hereditary principles of all the Boeotians, should come and pile his arms with them, supposing that the city would easily come over to them by this method.

2.3.1
958
 οἱ δὲ Πλαταιῆς ὡς ᾔσθοντο ἔνδον τε ὄντας τοὺς Θηβαίους καὶ ἐξαπιναίως κατειλημμένην τὴν πόλιν , καταδείσαντες καὶ νομίσαντες πολλῷ πλείους ἐσεληλυθέναι ( οὐ γὰρ ἑώρων ἐν τῇ νυκτί ) πρὸς ξύμβασιν ἐχώρησαν καὶ τοὺς λόγους δεξάμενοι ἡσύχαζον , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐς οὐδένα οὐδὲν ἐνεωτέριζον .
The Plataeans, on finding that the Thebans were within their walls, and that their city was unexpectedly taken, being very much alarmed, and thinking that far more had entered than really had, (for they did not see them in the night,) came to an agreement, and having accepted the terms, remained quiet; especially since they were proceeding to no violent measures against any one.

2.3.2
959
 πράσσοντες δέ πως ταῦτα κατενόησαν οὐ πολλοὺς τοὺς Θηβαίους ὄντας καὶ ἐνόμισαν ἐπιθέμενοι ῥᾳδίως κρατήσειν ·
But by some means or other while making these negotiations, they observed that the Thebans were not numerous, and thought that by attacking them they might easily overpower them;

2.3.2
960
 τῷ γὰρ πλήθει τῶν Πλαταιῶν οὐ βουλομένῳ ἦν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀφίστασθαι .
for it was not the wish of the great body of the Plataeans to revolt from the Athenians.

2.3.3
961
 ἐδόκει οὖν ἐπιχειρητέα εἶναι , καὶ ξυνελέγοντο διορύσσοντες τοὺς κοινοὺς τοίχους παρ’ ἀλλήλους , ὅπως μὴ διὰ τῶν ὁδῶν φανεροὶ ὦσιν ἰόντες , ἁμάξας τε ἄνευ τῶν ὑποζυγίων ἐς τὰς ὁδοὺς καθίστασαν , ἵνα ἀντὶ τείχους ᾖ , καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐξήρτυον ᾗ ἕκαστον ἐφαίνετο πρὸς τὰ παρόντα ξύμφορον ἔσεσθαι .
They determined therefore to make the attempt; and proceeded to join each other by digging through the partition-walls [of their houses], that they might not be seen going through the streets; and set waggons without the cattle in the streets, to serve for a barricade; and got every thing else ready, as each seemed likely to be of service for the business in hand.

2.3.4
962
 ἐπεὶ δὲ ὡς ἐκ τῶν δυνατῶν ἑτοῖμα ἦν , φυλάξαντες ἔτι νύκτα καὶ αὐτὸ τὸ περίορθρον ἐχώρουν ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ἐπ’ αὐτούς , ὅπως μὴ κατὰ φῶς θαρσαλεωτέροις οὖσι προσφέροιντο καὶ σφίσιν ἐκ τοῦ ἴσου γίγνωνται , ἀλλ’ ἐν νυκτὶ φοβερώτεροι ὄντες ἥσσους ὦσι τῆς σφετέρας ἐμπειρίας τῆς κατὰ τὴν πόλιν .
When things were in readiness, as far as they could make them so, having watched for the time when it was still night and just about day-break, they began to go out of their houses against them; that they might not attack them by day-light, when they would be more bold, and on equal terms with themselves, but in the night, when they would be more timid, and fight at a disadvantage through their own acquaintance with the city.

2.3.4
963
 προσέβαλόν τε εὐθὺς καὶ ἐς χεῖρας ᾖσαν κατὰ τάχος .
So they assailed them immediately, and came to close quarters with them as quickly as they could.

2.4.1
964
 οἱ δ’ ὡς ἔγνωσαν ἐξηπατημένοι , ξυνεστρέφοντό τε ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς καὶ τὰς προσβολὰς ᾗ προσπίπτοιεν ἀπεωθοῦντο .
The Thebans, on finding themselves outwitted, proceeded to close their ranks, and repel their attacks, wherever they might fall upon them.

2.4.2
965
 καὶ δὶς μὲν ἢ τρὶς ἀπεκρούσαντο , ἔπειτα πολλῷ θορύβῳ αὐτῶν τε προσβαλόντων καὶ τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ τῶν οἰκετῶν ἅμα ἀπὸ τῶν οἰκιῶν κραυγῇ τε καὶ ὀλολυγῇ χρωμένων λίθοις τε καὶ κεράμῳ βαλλόντων , καὶ ὑετοῦ ἅμα διὰ νυκτὸς πολλοῦ ἐπιγενομένου , ἐφοβήθησαν καὶ τραπόμενοι ἔφευγον διὰ τῆς πόλεως , ἄπειροι μὲν ὄντες οἱ πλείους ἐν σκότῳ καὶ πηλῷ τῶν διόδων ᾗ χρὴ σωθῆναι ( καὶ γὰρ τελευτῶντος τοῦ μηνὸς τὰ γιγνόμενα ἦν ) , ἐμπείρους δὲ ἔχοντες τοὺς διώκοντας τοῦ μὴ ἐκφεύγειν , ὥστε διεφθείροντο οἱ πολλοί .
And twice or thrice they beat them off; but afterwards, when the men were assailing them with a great clamour, and the women and slaves were raising a loud shouting and screaming from the houses, and pelting them with stones and tiles, and a violent rain also had come on in the night, they were frightened, and turned and fled through the city, the greater part of them, through the dark and dirt, (for the event happened at the end of the month,) being unacquainted with the ways out, by which they were to save themselves; while they had pursuers who were acquainted with them, to prevent their escaping: so that many were put to death.

2.4.3
966
 τῶν δὲ Πλαταιῶν τις τὰς πύλας ᾗ ἐσῆλθον καὶ αἵπερ ἦσαν μόναι ἀνεῳγμέναι ἔκλῃσε στυρακίῳ ἀκοντίου ἀντὶ βαλάνου χρησάμενος ἐς τὸν μοχλόν , ὥστε μηδὲ ταύτῃ ἔξοδον ἔτι εἶναι .
Moreover, one of the Plataeans had shut the gate by which they had entered, and which was the only one opened, by driving the spike of a spear into the bar, instead of a bolt; so that there was no longer any way out even by that.

2.4.4
967
 διωκόμενοι δὲ κατὰ τὴν πόλιν οἱ μέν τινες αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος ἀναβάντες ἔρριψαν ἐς τὸ ἔξω σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ διεφθάρησαν οἱ πλείους , οἱ δὲ κατὰ πύλας ἐρήμους γυναικὸς δούσης πέλεκυν λαθόντες καὶ διακόψαντες τὸν μοχλὸν ἐξῆλθον οὐ πολλοί ( αἴσθησις γὰρ ταχεῖα ἐπεγένετο ) , ἄλλοι δὲ ἄλλῃ τῆς πόλεως σποράδες ἀπώλλυντο .
As they were chased up and down the city, some of them mounted the wall and threw themselves over, and perished most of them: others came to a lone gate, and, a woman having given them an axe, cut through the bar without being observed, and went out, but in no great numbers, for it was quickly discovered; while others met their fate scattered about in different parts of the city.

2.4.5
968
 τὸ δὲ πλεῖστον καὶ ὅσον μάλιστα ἦν ξυνεστραμμένον ἐσπίπτουσιν ἐς οἴκημα μέγα , ὃ ἦν τοῦ τείχους καὶ αἱ θύραι ἀνεῳγμέναι ἔτυχον αὐτοῦ , οἰόμενοι πύλας τὰς θύρας τοῦ οἰκήματος εἶναι καὶ ἄντικρυς δίοδον ἐς τὸ ἔξω .
But the largest and most united body of them rushed into a spacious building which joined on to the wall, and the near door of which happened to be open, thinking that the door of the building was a gate [of the city], and that there was a passage straight through to the outside.

2.4.6
969
 ὁρῶντες δὲ αὐτοὺς οἱ Πλαταιῆς ἀπειλημμένους ἐβουλεύοντο εἴτε κατακαύσωσιν ὥσπερ ἔχουσιν , ἐμπρήσαντες τὸ οἴκημα , εἴτε τι ἄλλο χρήσωνται .
When the Plataeans saw them cut off, they consulted whether they should burn them where they were, by setting fire to the building, or treat them in any other way.

2.4.7
970
 τέλος δὲ οὗτοί τε καὶ ὅσοι ἄλλοι τῶν Θηβαίων περιῆσαν κατὰ τὴν πόλιν πλανώμενοι , ξυνέβησαν τοῖς Πλαταιεῦσι παραδοῦναι σφᾶς τε αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰ ὅπλα χρήσασθαι ὅτι ἂν βούλωνται .
At last, both those and all the rest of the Thebans that were yet alive, and wandering up and down the city, agreed to deliver up themselves and their arms to the Plataeans, to do with them as they pleased.

2.4.8
971
 οἱ μὲν δὴ ἐν τῇ Πλαταίᾳ οὕτως ἐπεπράγεσαν ·
Thus then fared the party who were in Plataea.

2.5.1
972
 οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι Θηβαῖοι , οὓς ἔδει ἔτι τῆς νυκτὸς παραγενέσθαι πανστρατιᾷ , εἴ τι ἄρα μὴ προχωροίη τοῖς ἐσεληλυθόσι , τῆς ἀγγελίας ἅμα καθ’ ὁδὸν αὐτοῖς ῥηθείσης περὶ τῶν γεγενημένων ἐπεβοήθουν .
The rest of the Thebans, who were to have joined them with all their forces while it was still night, in case those who had entered should be at all unsuccessful, on receiving on their march the tidings of what had happened, advanced to their succour.

2.5.2
973
 ἀπέχει δὲ ἡ Πλάταια τῶν Θηβῶν σταδίους ἑβδομήκοντα , καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ γενόμενον τῆς νυκτὸς ἐποίησε βραδύτερον αὐτοὺς ἐλθεῖν ·
Now Plataea is seventy stades distant from Thebes, and the rain which had fallen in the night made them proceed the slower;

2.5.2
974
 ὁ γὰρ Ἀσωπὸς ποταμὸς ἐρρύη μέγας καὶ οὐ ῥᾳδίως διαβατὸς ἦν .
for the river Asopus was flowing with a full stream, and was not to be crossed easily.

2.5.3
975
 πορευόμενοί τε ἐν ὑετῷ καὶ τὸν ποταμὸν μόλις διαβάντες ὕστερον παρεγένοντο , ἤδη τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν μὲν διεφθαρμένων , τῶν δὲ ζώντων ἐχομένων .
So by marching through the rain, and having passed the river with difficulty, they arrived too late; as some of the men had been by this time slain, and others of them were kept alive as prisoners.

2.5.4
976
 ὡς δ’ ᾔσθοντο οἱ Θηβαῖοι τὸ γεγενημένον , ἐπεβούλευον τοῖς ἔξω τῆς πόλεως τῶν Πλαταιῶν ·
When the Thebans learned what had happened, they formed a design against those of the Plataeans who were outside the city, (for there were both men and stock in the fields, inasmuch as the evil had happened unexpectedly in time of peace,)

2.5.4
977
 ἦσαν γὰρ καὶ ἄνθρωποι κατὰ τοὺς ἀγροὺς καὶ κατασκευή , οἷα ἀπροσδοκήτου κακοῦ ἐν εἰρήνῃ γενομένου ·
for there were both men and stock in the fields, inasmuch as the evil had happened unexpectedly in time of peace,

2.5.4
978
 ἐβούλοντο γὰρ σφίσιν , εἴ τινα λάβοιεν , ὑπάρχειν ἀντὶ τῶν ἔνδον , ἢν ἄρα τύχωσί τινες ἐζωγρημένοι .
for they wished to have all they could take to exchange for their own men within, should any happen to have been taken alive.

2.5.4
979
 καὶ οἱ μὲν ταῦτα διενοοῦντο , οἱ δὲ Πλαταιῆς ἔτι διαβουλευομένων αὐτῶν ὑποτοπήσαντες τοιοῦτόν τι ἔσεσθαι καὶ δείσαντες περὶ τοῖς ἔξω κήρυκα ἐξέπεμψαν παρὰ τοὺς Θηβαίους , λέγοντες ὅτι οὔτε τὰ πεποιημένα ὅσια δράσειαν ἐν σπονδαῖς σφῶν πειράσαντες καταλαβεῖν τὴν πόλιν , τά τε ἔξω ἔλεγον αὐτοῖς μὴ ἀδικεῖν ·
Such were their plans.

2.5.5
980
 εἰ δὲ μή , καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔφασαν αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄνδρας ἀποκτενεῖν οὓς ἔχουσι ζῶντας ·
But the Plataeans, while they were still deliberating, having suspected that there would be something of this kind, and being alarmed for those outside, sent out a herald to the Thebans, saying that they had not acted justly in what had been done, by endeavoring to seize their city in time of treaty;

2.5.5
981
 ἀναχωρησάντων δὲ πάλιν ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἀποδώσειν αὐτοῖς τοὺς ἄνδρας .
and told them not to injure what was without; else they would also put to death the men whom they had alive in their hands; but if they withdrew again from the territory, they would give the men back to them.

2.5.6
982
 Θηβαῖοι μὲν ταῦτα λέγουσι καὶ ἐπομόσαι φασὶν αὐτούς ·
The Thebans give this account of the matter, and say that they swore to it.

2.5.6
983
 Πλαταιῆς δ’ οὐχ ὁμολογοῦσι τοὺς ἄνδρας εὐθὺς ὑποσχέσθαι ἀποδώσειν , ἀλλὰ λόγων πρῶτον γενομένων ἤν τι ξυμβαίνωσι , καὶ ἐπομόσαι οὔ φασιν .
But the Plataeans do not acknowledge that they promised to give back the men but when proposals had first been made, in case of their coming to any agreement: and they deny that they swore to it.

2.5.7
984
 ἐκ δ’ οὖν τῆς γῆς ἀνεχώρησαν οἱ Θηβαῖοι οὐδὲν ἀδικήσαντες ·
At any rate the Thebans retired from the territory without having done any injury;

2.5.7
985
 οἱ δὲ Πλαταιῆς ἐπειδὴ τὰ ἐκ τῆς χώρας κατὰ τάχος ἐσεκομίσαντο , ἀπέκτειναν τοὺς ἄνδρας εὐθύς .
but the Plataeans, after getting in as quickly as possible whatever they had in the country, immediately put the men to death.

2.5.7
986
 ἦσαν δὲ ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν οἱ ληφθέντες , καὶ Εὐρύμαχος εἷς αὐτῶν ἦν , πρὸς ὃν ἔπραξαν οἱ προδιδόντες .
Those who had been taken were one hundred and eighty, and Eurymachus, with whom the traitors had negotiated, was one of them.

2.6.1
987
 τοῦτο δὲ ποιήσαντες ἔς τε τὰς Ἀθήνας ἄγγελον ἔπεμπον καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν τοῖς Θηβαίοις , τά τε ἐν τῇ πόλει καθίσταντο πρὸς τὰ παρόντα ᾗ ἐδόκει αὐτοῖς .
When they had done this, they sent a messenger to Athens, and gave back the dead to the Thebans under a truce, and arranged matters in the city to suit their present circumstances, as seemed best to them.—Now news had immediately been taken to the Athenians of what had been done with respect to the Plataeans;

2.6.2
988
 τοῖς δ’ Ἀθηναίοις ἠγγέλθη εὐθὺς τὰ περὶ τῶν Πλαταιῶν γεγενημένα , καὶ Βοιωτῶν τε παραχρῆμα ξυνέλαβον ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ καὶ ἐς τὴν Πλάταιαν ἔπεμψαν κήρυκα , κελεύοντες εἰπεῖν μηδὲν νεώτερον ποιεῖν περὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν οὓς ἔχουσι Θηβαίων , πρὶν ἄν τι καὶ αὐτοὶ βουλεύσωσι περὶ αὐτῶν ·
and they straightway seized as many of the Boeotians as were in Attica, and sent a herald to Plataea, with orders to forbid their proceeding to extremities, in the case of the Thebans whom they had in their hands, till  also should take counsel about them:

2.6.3
989
 οὐ γὰρ ἠγγέλθη αὐτοῖς ὅτι τεθνηκότες εἶεν .
For tidings of their being dead had not yet reached them.

2.6.3
990
 ἅμα γὰρ τῇ ἐσόδῳ γιγνομένῃ τῶν Θηβαίων ὁ πρῶτος ἄγγελος ἐξῄει , ὁ δὲ δεύτερος ἄρτι νενικημένων τε καὶ ξυνειλημμένων ·
For the first messenger [of the Plataeans] had gone out at the very time of the entering of the Thebans; and the second, when they had just been conquered and taken:

2.6.3
991
 καὶ τῶν ὕστερον οὐδὲν ᾔδεσαν .
so that of the subsequent events they knew nothing.

2.6.3
992
 οὕτω δὴ οὐκ εἰδότες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπέστελλον ·
Thus then the Athenians were in ignorance when they sent their order;

2.6.3
993
 ὁ δὲ κῆρυξ ἀφικόμενος ηὗρε τοὺς ἄνδρας διεφθαρμένους .
and the herald, on his arrival, found the men slain.

2.6.4
994
 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι στρατεύσαντες ἐς Πλάταιαν σῖτόν τε ἐσήγαγον καὶ φρουροὺς ἐγκατέλιπον , τῶν τε ἀνθρώπων τοὺς ἀχρειοτάτους ξὺν γυναιξὶ καὶ παισὶν ἐξεκόμισαν .
After this the Athenians marched to Plataea, and brought in provisions, and left a garrison in it, and took out the least efficient of the men with the women and children.

2.7.1
995
 γεγενημένου δὲ τοῦ ἐν Πλαταιαῖς ἔργου καὶ λελυμένων λαμπρῶς τῶν σπονδῶν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι παρεσκευάζοντο ὡς πολεμήσοντες , παρεσκευάζοντο δὲ καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι , πρεσβείας τε μέλλοντες πέμπειν παρὰ βασιλέα καὶ ἄλλοσε πρὸς τοὺς βαρβάρους , εἴ ποθέν τινα ὠφελίαν ἤλπιζον ἑκάτεροι προσλήψεσθαι , πόλεις τε ξυμμαχίδας ποιούμενοι ὅσαι ἦσαν ἐκτὸς τῆς ἑαυτῶν δυνάμεως .
When the business at Plataea had occurred, and the treaty had been clearly broken, the Athenians began to prepare for going to war; and so did the Lacedaemonians and their allies, both intending to send embassies to the king, and to the barbarians in other parts, from whatever quarter either party hoped to gain any assistance, and bringing into alliance with them such states as were not in their power.

2.7.2
996
 καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις μὲν πρὸς ταῖς αὐτοῦ ὑπαρχούσαις ἐξ Ἰταλίας καὶ Σικελίας τοῖς τ- ἐκείνων ἑλομένοις ναῦς ἐπετάχθη ποιεῖσθαι κατὰ μέγεθος τῶν πόλεων , ὡς ἐς τὸν πάντα ἀριθμὸν πεντακοσίων νεῶν ἐσομένων , καὶ ἀργύριον ῥητὸν ἑτοιμάζειν , τά τε ἄλλα ἡσυχάζοντας καὶ Ἀθηναίους δεχομένους μιᾷ νηὶ ἕως ἂν ταῦτα παρασκευασθῇ .
And on the side of the Lacedaemonians, in addition to the ships already on the spot in Sicily and Italy, belonging to those who had espoused their cause, they were ordered to build more according to the greatness of the cities, so that in the whole number they should amount to five hundred; and to get ready a certain sum of money which was mentioned, while they remained quiet in other respects, and received the Athenians coming with a single ship, till these preparations should be made.

2.7.3
997
 Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ τήν τε ὑπάρχουσαν ξυμμαχίαν ἐξήταζον καὶ ἐς τὰ περὶ Πελοπόννησον μᾶλλον χωρία ἐπρεσβεύοντο , Κέρκυραν καὶ Κεφαλληνίαν καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνας καὶ Ζάκυνθον , ὁρῶντες , εἰ σφίσι φίλια ταῦτ’ εἴη βεβαίως , πέριξ τὴν Πελοπόννησον καταπολεμήσοντες .
The Athenians, on the other hand, were inspecting their present confederacy, and sending ambassadors to the countries more immediately around the Peloponnese, as Corcyra, Cephallenia, Acarnania, and Zacynthus; seeing that if these were firm friends to them, they would successfully carry on the war round the Peloponnese.

2.8.1
998
 ὀλίγον τε ἐπενόουν οὐδὲν ἀμφότεροι , ἀλλ’ ἔρρωντο ἐς τὸν πόλεμον οὐκ ἀπεικότως ·
Indeed both parties had no small designs, but put forth their strength to the war: and not unnaturally; for all men at the beginning apply themselves to it more eagerly;

2.8.1
999
 ἀρχόμενοι γὰρ πάντες ὀξύτερον ἀντιλαμβάνονται , τότε δὲ καὶ νεότης πολλὴ μὲν οὖσα ἐν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ , πολλὴ δ’ ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις οὐκ ἀκουσίως ὑπὸ ἀπειρίας ἥπτετο τοῦ πολέμου , ἥ τε ἄλλη Ἑλλὰς ἅπασα μετέωρος ἦν ξυνιουσῶν τῶν πρώτων πόλεων .
and at that time the young men, being numerous in the Peloponnese, and also at Athens, were, through their inexperience, not unwilling to engage in the war.

2.8.2
1000
 καὶ πολλὰ μὲν λόγια ἐλέγετο , πολλὰ δὲ χρησμολόγοι ᾖδον ἔν τε τοῖς μέλλουσι πολεμήσειν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις πόλεσιν .
And many prophecies were repeated, and reciters of oracles were singing many of them, both amongst those who were going to war and in the other states.

2.8.3
1001
 ἔτι δὲ Δῆλος ἐκινήθη ὀλίγον πρὸ τούτων , πρότερον οὔπω σεισθεῖσα ἀφ’ οὗ Ἕλληνες μέμνηνται ·
Moreover, Delos had been visited by an earthquake a short time before this, though it had never had a shock before in the memory of the Greeks;

2.8.3
1002
 ἐλέγετο δὲ καὶ ἐδόκει ἐπὶ τοῖς μέλλουσι γενήσεσθαι σημῆναι .
and it was said and thought to have been ominous of what was about to take place.

2.8.3
1003
 εἴ τέ τι ἄλλο τοιουτότροπον ξυνέβη γενέσθαι , πάντα ἀνεζητεῖτο .
And whatever else of this kind had happened to occur was all searched up.

2.8.4
1004
 ἡ δὲ εὔνοια παρὰ πολὺ ἐποίει τῶν ἀνθρώπων μᾶλλον ἐς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , ἄλλως τε καὶ προειπόντων ὅτι τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἐλευθεροῦσιν .
The good wishes of men made greatly for the Lacedaemonians, especially as they gave out that they were the liberators of Greece.

2.8.4
1005
 ἔρρωτό τε πᾶς καὶ ἰδιώτης καὶ πόλις εἴ τι δύναιτο καὶ λόγῳ καὶ ἔργῳ ξυνεπιλαμβάνειν αὐτοῖς ·
And every individual, as well as state, put forth his strength to help them in whatever he could, both by word and deed.

2.8.4
1006
 ἐν τούτῳ τε κεκωλῦσθαι ἐδόκει ἑκάστῳ τὰ πράγματα ᾧ μή τις αὐτὸς παρέσται .
And each thought that the cause was impeded at that point at which he himself would not be present.

2.8.5
1007
 οὕτως ἐν ὀργῇ εἶχον οἱ πλείους τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , οἱ μὲν τῆς ἀρχῆς ἀπολυθῆναι βουλόμενοι , οἱ δὲ μὴ ἀρχθῶσι φοβούμενοι .
So angry were the generality with the Athenians; some from a wish to be released from their dominion, others from a fear of being brought under it. With such preparations and feelings then did they enter on the contest.

2.9.1
1008
 παρασκευῇ μὲν οὖν καὶ γνώμῃ τοιαύτῃ ὥρμηντο , πόλεις δὲ ἑκάτεροι τάσδε ἔχοντες ξυμμάχους ἐς τὸν πόλεμον καθίσταντο .
Each party had the following states in alliance when they set to the war. The allies of the Lacedaemonians were these:

2.9.2
1009
 Λακεδαιμονίων μὲν οἵδε ξύμμαχοι ·
Lacedaemonians were allied with:

2.9.2
1010
 Πελοποννήσιοι μὲν οἱ ἐντὸς Ἰσθμοῦ πάντες πλὴν Ἀργείων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν ( τούτοις δὲ ἐς ἀμφοτέρους φιλία ἦν ·
all the Peloponnesians within the Isthmus, except the Argives and Achaeans (these were in friendship with both parties;

2.9.2
1011
 Πελληνῆς δὲ Ἀχαιῶν μόνοι ξυνεπολέμουν τὸ πρῶτον , ἔπειτα δὲ ὕστερον καὶ ἅπαντες , ἔξω δὲ Πελοποννήσου Μεγαρῆς , Βοιωτοί , Λοκροί , Φωκῆς , Ἀμπρακιῶται , Λευκάδιοι , Ἀνακτόριοι .
and the Pellenians were the only people of the Achaeans that joined in the war at first, though afterwards all of them did); and without the Peloponnese, the Megareans, Locrians, Boeotians, Phocians, Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians.

2.9.3
1012
 τούτων ναυτικὸν παρείχοντο Κορίνθιοι , Μεγαρῆς , Σικυώνιοι , Πελληνῆς , Ἠλεῖοι , Ἀμπρακιῶται , Λευκάδιοι , ἱππέας δὲ Βοιωτοί , Φωκῆς , Λοκροί ·
Of these, the states which furnished a navy were the Corinthians, Megareans, Sicyonians, Pellenians, Eleans, Ambraciots, and Leucadians.

2.9.3
1013
 αἱ δ’ ἄλλαι πόλεις πεζὸν παρεῖχον .
Those that supplied cavalry were the Boeotians, Phocians, and Locrians.

2.9.3
1014
 αὕτη μὲν Λακεδαιμονίων ξυμμαχία ·
The rest of them sent infantry. This then was the Lacedaemonian confederacy.

2.9.4
1015
 Ἀθηναίων δὲ Χῖοι , Λέσβιοι , Πλαταιῆς , Μεσσήνιοι οἱ ἐν Ναυπάκτῳ , Ἀκαρνάνων οἱ πλείους , Κερκυραῖοι , Ζακύνθιοι , καὶ ἄλλαι πόλεις αἱ ὑποτελεῖς οὖσαι ἐν ἔθνεσι τοσοῖσδε , Καρία ἡ ἐπὶ θαλάσσῃ , Δωριῆς Καρσὶ πρόσοικοι , Ἰωνία , Ἑλλήσποντος , τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης , νῆσοι ὅσαι ἐντὸς Πελοποννήσου καὶ Κρήτης πρὸς ἥλιον ἀνίσχοντα , πᾶσαι αἱ Κυκλάδες πλὴν Μήλου καὶ Θήρας .
That of the Athenians comprehended the Chians, Lesbians, Plataeans, the Messenians at Naupactus, the greater part of the Acarnanians, the Corcyreans, the Zacynthians: also some other states which were tributary amongst the following nations; as the maritime parts of Caria, and Doris adjacent to it, Ionia, the Hellespont, the Greek towns Thrace-ward; the islands, which were situated between the Peloponnese and Crete, towards the east, and all the rest of the Cyclades except Melos and Thera.

2.9.5
1016
 τούτων ναυτικὸν παρείχοντο Χῖοι , Λέσβιοι , Κερκυραῖοι , οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι πεζὸν καὶ χρήματα .
Of these, the Chians, Lesbians, and Corcyraeans furnished a naval force, the rest of them infantry and money.

2.9.6
1017
 ξυμμαχία μὲν αὕτη ἑκατέρων καὶ παρασκευὴ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον ἦν .
Such was the confederacy on each side, and their resources for the war.

2.10.1
1018
 οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι μετὰ τὰ ἐν Πλαταιαῖς εὐθὺς περιήγγελλον κατὰ τὴν Πελοπόννησον καὶ τὴν ἔξω ξυμμαχίδα στρατιὰν παρασκευάζεσθαι ταῖς πόλεσι τά τε ἐπιτήδεια οἷα εἰκὸς ἐπὶ ἔξοδον ἔκδημον ἔχειν , ὡς ἐσβαλοῦντες ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν .
The Lacedaemonians, immediately after what had happened at Plataea, sent round orders through the Peloponnese and the rest of their confederacy, for the states to prepare an army and such provisions as it was proper to have for a foreign expedition, with a view to invading Attica.

2.10.2
1019
 ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἑκάστοις ἑτοῖμα γίγνοιτο , κατὰ τὸν χρόνον τὸν εἰρημένον ξυνῇσαν τὰ δύο μέρη ἀπὸ πόλεως ἑκάστης ἐς τὸν Ἰσθμόν .
When they had each got ready by the appointed time, two thirds from every state assembled at the Isthmus.

2.10.3
1020
 καὶ ἐπειδὴ πᾶν τὸ στράτευμα ξυνειλεγμένον ἦν , Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων , ὅσπερ ἡγεῖτο τῆς ἐξόδου ταύτης , ξυγκαλέσας τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν πόλεων πασῶν καὶ τοὺς μάλιστα ἐν τέλει καὶ ἀξιολογωτάτους παρῄνει τοιάδε .
And after the whole army was mustered, Archidamus, the king of the Lacedaemonians, who led this expedition, summoned to his presence the generals of all the states, and those highest in office and of most importance, and spoke to the following purport:

2.11.1
1021
 &quot; ἄνδρες Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ ξύμμαχοι , καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν πολλὰς στρατείας καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ Πελοποννήσῳ καὶ ἔξω ἐποιήσαντο , καὶ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι οὐκ ἄπειροι πολέμων εἰσίν ·
“Men of Peloponnese and allies, both our fathers made many expeditions, as well in the Peloponnese as out of it, and the elder part of ourselves are not without experience in wars.

2.11.1
1022
 ὅμως δὲ τῆσδε οὔπω μείζονα παρασκευὴν ἔχοντες ἐξήλθομεν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ πόλιν δυνατωτάτην νῦν ἐρχόμεθα καὶ αὐτοὶ πλεῖστοι καὶ ἄριστοι στρατεύοντες .
Never yet, however, have we marched out with a greater force than this; but we are now going against a most powerful state, and with a most numerous and most excellently equipped army on our own side.”

2.11.2
1023
 δίκαιον οὖν ἡμᾶς μήτε τῶν πατέρων χείρους φαίνεσθαι μήτε ἡμῶν αὐτῶν τῆς δόξης ἐνδεεστέρους .
“We ought then to show ourselves neither inferior to our fathers, nor degenerated from our own character.

2.11.2
1024
 ἡ γὰρ Ἑλλὰς πᾶσα τῇδε τῇ ὁρμῇ ἐπῆρται καὶ προσέχει τὴν γνώμην , εὔνοιαν ἔχουσα διὰ τὸ Ἀθηναίων ἔχθος πρᾶξαι ἡμᾶς ἃ ἐπινοοῦμεν .
For the whole of Greece has its expectation raised, and is paying attention to this attack, with good wishes that we may succeed in our designs, through their hatred of the Athenians.”

2.11.3
1025
 οὔκουν χρή , εἴ τῳ καὶ δοκοῦμεν πλήθει ἐπιέναι καὶ ἀσφάλεια πολλὴ εἶναι μὴ ἂν ἐλθεῖν τοὺς ἐναντίους ἡμῖν διὰ μάχης , τούτων ἕνεκα ἀμελέστερόν τι παρεσκευασμένους χωρεῖν , ἀλλὰ καὶ πόλεως ἑκάστης ἡγεμόνα καὶ στρατιώτην τὸ καθ’ αὑτὸν αἰεὶ προσδέχεσθαι ἐς κίνδυνόν τινα ἥξειν .
" Though, then, some may think that we are making the attack with superior numbers, and that it is very certain our adversaries will not meet us in battle, we must not, for this reason, go at all less carefully prepared; but both the general and soldier of each state should, as far as concerns himself, be always expecting to come into danger."

2.11.4
1026
 ἄδηλα γὰρ τὰ τῶν πολέμων , καὶ ἐξ ὀλίγου τὰ πολλὰ καὶ δι’ ὀργῆς αἱ ἐπιχειρήσεις γίγνονται ·
"For the events of war are uncertain, and attacks are generally made in it with short notice, and under the impulse of passion;

2.11.4
1027
 πολλάκις τε τὸ ἔλασσον πλῆθος δεδιὸς ἄμεινον ἠμύνατο τοὺς πλέονας διὰ τὸ καταφρονοῦντας ἀπαρασκεύους γενέσθαι .
frequently, too, has the less number, through being afraid, more successfully repelled the more numerous forces, through their being unprepared in consequence of their contempt."

2.11.5
1028
 χρὴ δὲ αἰεὶ ἐν τῇ πολεμίᾳ τῇ μὲν γνώμῃ θαρσαλέους στρατεύειν , τῷ δ’ ἔργῳ δεδιότας παρεσκευάσθαι ·
In the enemy's country indeed men ought always to march with boldness of feeling,

2.11.5
1029
 οὕτω γὰρ πρός τε τὸ ἐπιέναι τοῖς ἐναντίοις εὐψυχότατοι ἂν εἶεν πρός τε τὸ ἐπιχειρεῖσθαι ἀσφαλέστατοι .
but at the same time to make their actual preparations with a degree of fear; for in this way they would be at once most full of courage for attacking their adversaries, and most secure against being attacked."

2.11.6
1030
 ἡμεῖς δὲ οὐδ’ ἐπὶ ἀδύνατον ἀμύνεσθαι οὕτω πόλιν ἐρχόμεθα , ἀλλὰ τοῖς πᾶσιν ἄριστα παρεσκευασμένην , ὥστε χρὴ καὶ πάνυ ἐλπίζειν διὰ μάχης ἰέναι αὐτούς , εἰ μὴ καὶ νῦν ὥρμηνται ἐν ᾧ οὔπω πάρεσμεν , ἀλλ’ ὅταν ἐν τῇ γῇ ὁρῶσιν ἡμᾶς δῃοῦντάς τε καὶ τ- ἐκείνων φθείροντας .
" But in our own case, we are not going against a state that is so powerless to defend itself, but against one most excellently provided with every thing; so that we must fully expect that they will meet us in battle; and if they have not already set out before we are there, yet [that they will do so], when they see us in their territory wasting and destroying their property."

2.11.7
1031
 πᾶσι γὰρ ἐν τοῖς ὄμμασι καὶ ἐν τῷ παραυτίκα ὁρᾶν πάσχοντάς τι ἄηθες ὀργὴ προσπίπτει ·
“For all are angry, when suffering any unwonted evil, to see it done before their eyes, and in their very presence:

2.11.7
1032
 καὶ οἱ λογισμῷ ἐλάχιστα χρώμενοι θυμῷ πλεῖστα ἐς ἔργον καθίστανται .
and those who [on such provocation] reflect the least, set to work with the greatest passion [to avenge themselves].”

2.11.8
1033
 Ἀθηναίους δὲ καὶ πλέον τι τῶν ἄλλων εἰκὸς τοῦτο δρᾶσαι , οἳ ἄρχειν τε τῶν ἄλλων ἀξιοῦσι καὶ ἐπιόντες τὴν τῶν πέλας δῃοῦν μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν αὑτῶν ὁρᾶν .
" And it is natural that the Athenians should do so even to a greater extent than other, since they presume to rule the rest of the world, and to go against and ravage their neighbours' land, rather than see their own ravaged."

2.11.9
1034
 ὡς οὖν ἐπὶ τοσαύτην πόλιν στρατεύοντες καὶ μεγίστην δόξαν οἰσόμενοι τοῖς τε προγόνοις καὶ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα ἐκ τῶν ἀποβαινόντων , ἕπεσθ’ ὅπῃ ἄν τις ἡγῆται , κόσμον καὶ φυλακὴν περὶ παντὸς ποιούμενοι καὶ τὰ παραγγελλόμενα ὀξέως δεχόμενοι ·
“As then we are marching against a state of this description, and shall gain for our forefathers, as well as for ourselves, the most decided character, one way or the other, from the results;

2.11.9
1035
 κάλλιστον γὰρ τόδε καὶ ἀσφαλέστατον , πολλοὺς ὄντας ἑνὶ κόσμῳ χρωμένους φαίνεσθαι &quot; .
follow where any one may lead you valuing order and caution above every thing, and with quickness receiving your commands. For this is the finest and the safest thing that can be seen, for a large body of men to show themselves maintaining uniform discipline.”

2.12.1
1036
 τοσαῦτα εἰπὼν καὶ διαλύσας τὸν ξύλλογον ὁ Ἀρχίδαμος Μελήσιππον πρῶτον ἀποστέλλει ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας τὸν Διακρίτου ἄνδρα Σπαρτιάτην , εἴ τι ἄρα μᾶλλον ἐνδοῖεν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὁρῶντες σφᾶς ἤδη ἐν ὁδῷ ὄντας .
Having thus spoken, and dismissed the assembly, Archidamus first sent Melesippus son of Diacritus, a Spartan, to Athens; in case the Athenians might be more disposed to submit, when they saw that the Peloponnesians were now on their march. But they did not admit him into the city, nor to their assembly;

2.12.2
1037
 οἱ δὲ οὐ προσεδέξαντο αὐτὸν ἐς τὴν πόλιν οὐδ’ ἐπὶ τὸ κοινόν ·
“For the opinion of Pericles had previously been adopted, not to admit any herald with an embassy from the Lacedaemonians, when they had once marched out from their frontiers.

2.12.2
1038
 ἦν γὰρ Περικλέους γνώμη πρότερον νενικηκυῖα κήρυκα καὶ πρεσβείαν μὴ προσδέχεσθαι Λακεδαιμονίων ἐξεστρατευμένων ·
They sent him back therefore before hearing him, and ordered him to beyond the borders that same day, and [to tell those who sent him] that in future, if they wished to propose any thing, they should send ambassadors after they had retired to their own territories.

2.12.2
1039
 ἀποπέμπουσιν οὖν αὐτὸν πρὶν ἀκοῦσαι καὶ ἐκέλευον ἐκτὸς ὅρων εἶναι αὐθημερόν , τό τε λοιπὸν ἀναχωρήσαντας ἐπὶ τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν , ἤν τι βούλωνται , πρεσβεύεσθαι .
They sent him back therefore before hearing him, and ordered him to beyond the borders that same day, and [to tell those who sent him] that in future, if they wished to propose any thing, they should send ambassadors after they had retired to their own territories.

2.12.2
1040
 ξυμπέμπουσί τε τῷ Μελησίππῳ ἀγωγούς , ὅπως μηδενὶ ξυγγένηται .
They sent him back therefore before hearing him, and ordered him to beyond the borders that same day, and [to tell those who sent him] that in future, if they wished to propose any thing, they should send ambassadors after they had retired to their own territories.

2.12.3
1041
 ὁ δ’ ἐπειδὴ ἐπὶ τοῖς ὁρίοις ἐγένετο καὶ ἔμελλε διαλύσεσθαι , τοσόνδε εἰπὼν ἐπορεύετο ὅτι &quot; ἥδε ἡ ἡμέρα τοῖς Ἕλλησι μεγάλων κακῶν ἄρξει &quot; .
And they sent an escort with Melesippus, to prevent his holding communication with any one. When he was on the frontiers, and was about to be dismissed, he spoke these words and departed " This day will be the beginning of great evils to Greece."

2.12.4
1042
 ὡς δὲ ἀφίκετο ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ ἔγνω ὁ Ἀρχίδαμος ὅτι οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐδέν πω ἐνδώσουσιν , οὕτω δὴ ἄρας τῷ στρατῷ προυχώρει ἐς τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν .
When he arrived at the camp, and Archidamus found that the Athenians would not yet submit at all, he then set out and advanced with his army into their territory.

2.12.5
1043
 Βοιωτοὶ δὲ μέρος μὲν τὸ σφέτερον καὶ τοὺς ἱππέας παρείχοντο Πελοποννησίοις ξυστρατεύειν , τοῖς δὲ λειπομένοις ἐς Πλάταιαν ἐλθόντες τὴν γῆν ἐδῄουν .
At the same time, the Boeotians, while they furnished their contingent and their cavalry to join the Peloponnesians in their expedition, went to Plataea with the remainder of their force, and laid waste their land.

2.13.1
1044
 ἔτι δὲ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ξυλλεγομένων τε ἐς τὸν Ἰσθμὸν καὶ ἐν ὁδῷ ὄντων , πρὶν ἐσβαλεῖν ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν , Περικλῆς ὁ Ξανθίππου στρατηγὸς ὢν Ἀθηναίων δέκατος αὐτός , ὡς ἔγνω τὴν ἐσβολὴν ἐσομένην , ὑποτοπήσας , ὅτι Ἀρχίδαμος αὐτῷ ξένος ὢν ἐτύγχανε , μὴ πολλάκις ἢ αὐτὸς ἰδίᾳ βουλόμενος χαρίζεσθαι τοὺς ἀγροὺς αὐτοῦ παραλίπῃ καὶ μὴ δῃώσῃ , ἢ καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων κελευσάντων ἐπὶ διαβολῇ τῇ ἑαυτοῦ γένηται τοῦτο , ὥσπερ καὶ τὰ ἄγη ἐλαύνειν προεῖπον ἕνεκα ἐκείνου , προηγόρευε τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ ὅτι Ἀρχίδαμος μέν οἱ ξένος εἴη , οὐ μέντοι ἐπὶ κακῷ γε τῆς πόλεως γένοιτο , τοὺς δὲ ἀγροὺς τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ καὶ οἰκίας ἢν ἄρα μὴ δῃώσωσιν οἱ πολέμιοι ὥσπερ καὶ τὰ τῶν ἄλλων , ἀφίησιν αὐτὰ δημόσια εἶναι καὶ μηδεμίαν οἱ ὑποψίαν κατὰ ταῦτα γίγνεσθαι .
While the Peloponnesians were still assembling at the Isthmus, and were on their march, before they invaded Attica, Pericles, son of Xanthippus, who was general of the Athenians with nine colleagues, when he found that the invasion would take place, suspected that either Archidamus, because he happened to be his friend, might frequently pass over his lands, and not ravage them, from a personal wish to oblige him; or that this might be done at the command of the Lacedaemonians for the purpose of raising a slander against him —as it was also with reference to  that they had charged them to drive out the accursed; and therefore he publicly declared to the Athenians in the assembly, that though Archidamus was his friend, he had not been admitted into his friendship for any harm to the state; should, then, the enemy not lay waste his lands and houses, like those of the rest, he gave them up to be public property, and that no suspicion might arise against him on these grounds.

2.13.2
1045
 παρῄνει δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν παρόντων ἅπερ καὶ πρότερον , παρασκευάζεσθαί τε ἐς τὸν πόλεμον καὶ τὰ ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἐσκομίζεσθαι , ἔς τε μάχην μὴ ἐπεξιέναι , ἀλλὰ τὴν πόλιν ἐσελθόντας φυλάσσειν , καὶ τὸ ναυτικόν , ᾗπερ ἰσχύουσιν , ἐξαρτύεσθαι , τά τε τῶν ξυμμάχων διὰ χειρὸς ἔχειν , λέγων τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τούτων εἶναι τῶν χρημάτων τῆς προσόδου , τὰ δὲ πολλὰ τοῦ πολέμου γνώμῃ καὶ χρημάτων περιουσίᾳ κρατεῖσθαι .
He gave them advice also on their present affairs, the same as he had before given; namely, to prepare for the war, and bring in their property from the country, and not go out against them to battle, but to come in and guard the city, and get ready their fleet, in which they were so strong, and keep the allies tight in hand; reminding them that their main strength was derived from the returns of the money paid by these, and that most of the advantages in war were gained by counsel and abundance of money.

2.13.3
1046
 θαρσεῖν τε ἐκέλευε προσιόντων μὲν ἑξακοσίων ταλάντων ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ φόρου κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ξυμμάχων τῇ πόλει ἄνευ τῆς ἄλλης προσόδου , ὑπαρχόντων δὲ ἐν τῇ ἀκροπόλει ἔτι τότε ἀργυρίου ἐπισήμου ἑξακισχιλίων ταλάντων ( τὰ γὰρ πλεῖστα τριακοσίων ἀποδέοντα μύρια ἐγένετο , ἀφ’ ὧν ἔς τε τὰ προπύλαια τῆς ἀκροπόλεως καὶ τ- ἄλλα οἰκοδομήματα καὶ ἐς Ποτείδαιαν ἀπανηλώθη ) , χωρὶς δὲ χρυσίου ἀσήμου καὶ ἀργυρίου ἔν τε ἀναθήμασιν ἰδίοις καὶ δημοσίοις καὶ ὅσα ἱερὰ σκεύη περί τε τὰς πομπὰς καὶ τοὺς ἀγῶνας καὶ σκῦλα Μηδικὰ καὶ εἴ τι τοιουτότροπον , οὐκ ἐλάσσονος ἦν ἢ πεντακοσίων ταλάντων .
And [on this head] he told them to be of good courage, as the state had, on an average, six hundred talents coming in yearly as tribute from the allies, not reckoning its other sources of income; while there were still at that time in the Acropolis 6000 talents of coined silver;

2.13.5
1047
 ἔτι δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐκ τῶν ἄλλων ἱερῶν προσετίθει χρήματα οὐκ ὀλίγα , οἷς χρήσεσθαι αὐτούς , καὶ ἢν πάνυ ἐξείργωνται πάντων , καὶ αὐτῆς τῆς θεοῦ τοῖς περικειμένοις χρυσίοις ·
Moreover, he added the treasures in the other temples, to no small amount, which they would use;

2.13.5
1048
 ἀπέφαινε δ’ ἔχον τὸ ἄγαλμα τεσσαράκοντα τάλαντα σταθμὸν χρυσίου ἀπέφθου , καὶ περιαιρετὸν εἶναι ἅπαν .
and, in case of their being absolutely excluded from all resources, even the golden appendages of the goddess herself; explaining to them that the statue contained 40 talents of pure gold, and that it was all removable;

2.13.5
1049
 χρησαμένους τε ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ ἔφη χρῆναι μὴ ἐλάσσω ἀντικαταστῆσαι πάλιν .
and after using it for their preservation they must, he said, restore it to the same amount.

2.13.6
1050
 χρήμασι μὲν οὖν οὕτως ἐθάρσυνεν αὐτούς , ὁπλίτας δὲ τρισχιλίους καὶ μυρίους εἶναι ἄνευ τῶν ἐν τοῖς φρουρίοις καὶ τῶν παρ’ ἔπαλξιν ἑξακισχιλίων καὶ μυρίων .
With regard to money, then, he thus encouraged them. And as for heavy-armed troops, he told them that they had thirteen thousand, besides those in garrisons and on the ramparts to the number of sixteen thousand.

2.13.7
1051
 τοσοῦτοι γὰρ ἐφύλασσον τὸ πρῶτον ὁπότε οἱ πολέμιοι ἐσβάλοιεν , ἀπό τε τῶν πρεσβυτάτων καὶ τῶν νεωτάτων , καὶ μετοίκων ὅσοι ὁπλῖται ἦσαν .
For this was the number that kept guard at first, whenever the enemy made an incursion, drawn from the oldest and the youngest, and such of the resident aliens as were heavyarmed.

2.13.7
1052
 τοῦ τε γὰρ Φαληρικοῦ τείχους στάδιοι ἦσαν πέντε καὶ τριάκοντα πρὸς τὸν κύκλον τοῦ ἄστεως , καὶ αὐτοῦ τοῦ κύκλου τὸ φυλασσόμενον τρεῖς καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ( ἔστι δὲ αὐτοῦ ὃ καὶ ἀφύλακτον ἦν , τὸ μεταξὺ τοῦ τε μακροῦ καὶ τοῦ Φαληρικοῦ ) , τὰ δὲ μακρὰ τείχη πρὸς τὸν Πειραιᾶ τεσσαράκοντα σταδίων , ὧν τὸ ἔξωθεν ἐτηρεῖτο ·
For of the Phaleric wall there were five and thirty stades to the circuit of the city wall; and of that circuit itself the guarded part was three and forty stades; a certain part of it being unguarded, viz. that between the long wall and the Phaleric.

2.13.7
1053
 καὶ τοῦ Πειραιῶς ξὺν Μουνιχίᾳ ἑξήκοντα μὲν σταδίων ὁ ἅπας περίβολος , τὸ δ’ ἐν φυλακῇ ὂν ἥμισυ τούτου .
There were also the long walls to the Piraeus, a distance of forty states, of which the outer one was manned; while the whole circumference of Piraeus with Munychia was sixty stades, though the guarded part was only half that extent. Of cavalry, again, he showed them that they had twelve hundred, including mounted bowmen;

2.13.8
1054
 ἱππέας δὲ ἀπέφαινε διακοσίους καὶ χιλίους ξὺν ἱπποτοξόταις , ἑξακοσίους δὲ καὶ χιλίους τοξότας , καὶ τριήρεις τὰς πλωίμους τριακοσίας .
with sixteen hundred bowmen [on foot], and three hundred triremes fit for service.

2.13.9
1055
 ταῦτα γὰρ ὑπῆρχεν Ἀθηναίοις καὶ οὐκ ἐλάσσω ἕκαστα τούτων , ὅτε ἡ ἐσβολὴ τὸ πρῶτον ἔμελλε Πελοποννησίων ἔσεσθαι καὶ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον καθίσταντο .
These resources, and no fewer than these in their several kinds, had the Athenians, when the invasion of the Peloponnesians was first going to be made, and when they were setting to the war.

2.13.9
1056
 ἔλεγε δὲ καὶ ἄλλα οἷάπερ εἰώθει Περικλῆς ἐς ἀπόδειξιν τοῦ περιέσεσθαι τῷ πολέμῳ .
Other statements also did Pericles make to them, as he was accustomed, to prove that they would have the superiority in the war.

2.14.1
1057
 οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀκούσαντες ἀνεπείθοντό τε καὶ ἐσεκομίζοντο ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας καὶ τὴν ἄλλην κατασκευὴν ᾗ κατ’ οἶκον ἐχρῶντο , καὶ αὐτῶν τῶν οἰκιῶν καθαιροῦντες τὴν ξύλωσιν ·
The Athenians were persuaded by what they heard from him; and proceeded to bring in from the country their children and wives, and all the furniture which they used in their houses, pulling down even the wood-work of their residences;

2.14.1
1058
 πρόβατα δὲ καὶ ὑποζύγια ἐς τὴν Εὔβοιαν διεπέμψαντο καὶ ἐς τὰς νήσους τὰς ἐπικειμένας .
while they sent their sheep and cattle over to Euboea and the adjacent islands.

2.14.2
1059
 χαλεπῶς δὲ αὐτοῖς διὰ τὸ αἰεὶ εἰωθέναι τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς διαιτᾶσθαι ἡ ἀνάστασις ἐγίγνετο .
But the removal was made by them with reluctance, from the greater part having always been accustomed to live in the country.

2.15.1
1060
 ξυνεβεβήκει δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ πάνυ ἀρχαίου ἑτέρων μᾶλλον Ἀθηναίοις τοῦτο .
This had, from the very earliest times, been the case with the Athenians;

2.15.1
1061
 ἐπὶ γὰρ Κέκροπος καὶ τῶν πρώτων βασιλέων ἡ Ἀττικὴ ἐς Θησέα αἰεὶ κατὰ πόλεις ᾠκεῖτο πρυτανεῖά τε ἐχούσας καὶ ἄρχοντας , καὶ ὁπότε μή τι δείσειαν , οὐ ξυνῇσαν βουλευσόμενοι ὡς τὸν βασιλέα , ἀλλ’ αὐτοὶ ἕκαστοι ἐπολίτευον καὶ ἐβουλεύοντο ·
For under Cecrops, and the first kings, down to the reign of Theseus, the population of Athens had always inhabited independent cities, with their own guild-halls and magistrates; and at such times as they were not in fear of any danger, they did not meet the king to consult with him, but themselves severally conducted their own government, and took their own counsel;

2.15.1
1062
 καί τινες καὶ ἐπολέμησάν ποτε αὐτῶν , ὥσπερ καὶ Ἐλευσίνιοι μετ’ Εὐμόλπου πρὸς Ἐρεχθέα .
and there were instances in which some of them even waged war [against him], as the Eleusinians with Eumolpus did against Erectheus.

2.15.2
1063
 ἐπειδὴ δὲ Θησεὺς ἐβασίλευσε , γενόμενος μετὰ τοῦ ξυνετοῦ καὶ δυνατὸς τά τε ἄλλα διεκόσμησε τὴν χώραν καὶ καταλύσας τῶν ἄλλων πόλεων τά τε βουλευτήρια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς ἐς τὴν νῦν πόλιν οὖσαν , ἓν βουλευτήριον ἀποδείξας καὶ πρυτανεῖον , ξυνῴκισε πάντας , καὶ νεμομένους τὰ αὑτῶν ἑκάστους ἅπερ καὶ πρὸ τοῦ ἠνάγκασε μιᾷ πόλει ταύτῃ χρῆσθαι , ἣ ἁπάντων ἤδη ξυντελούντων ἐς αὐτὴν μεγάλη γενομένη παρεδόθη ὑπὸ Θησέως τοῖς ἔπειτα ·
But when Theseus had come to the throne, who along with wisdom had power also, he both regulated the country in other respects, and having abolished the council-houses and magistracies of the other cities, he brought them all into union with the present city, assigning them one guild-hall and one council-house;

2.15.2
1064
 καὶ ξυνοίκια ἐξ ἐκείνου Ἀθηναῖοι ἔτι καὶ νῦν τῇ θεῷ ἑορτὴν δημοτελῆ ποιοῦσιν .
and compelled them all, while they enjoyed each their own property as before, to use this one city only; which, since all were counted as belonging to it, became great, and was so bequeathed by Theseus to those who came after him. And from that time even to this the Athenians keep, at the public expense, a festival to the goddess, called

2.15.3
1065
 τὸ δὲ πρὸ τοῦ ἡ ἀκρόπολις ἡ νῦν οὖσα πόλις ἦν , καὶ τὸ ὑπ’ αὐτὴν πρὸς νότον μάλιστα τετραμμένον .
Before that time, what is now the citadel was the city, with the district which lies under it, looking chiefly towards the south.

2.15.4
1066
 τεκμήριον δέ ·
And this is a proof of it; the temples of the other gods as well [as of Minerva] are in the citadel itself, and those that are out of it are situated chiefly in this part of the city;

2.15.4
1067
 τὰ γὰρ ἱερὰ ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἀκροπόλει † καὶ ἄλλων θεῶν ἐστὶ καὶ τὰ ἔξω πρὸς τοῦτο τὸ μέρος τῆς πόλεως μᾶλλον ἵδρυται , τό τε τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ Ὀλυμπίου καὶ τὸ Πύθιον καὶ τὸ τῆς Γῆς καὶ τὸ τοῦ ἐν Λίμναις Διονύσου , ᾧ τὰ ἀρχαιότερα Διονύσια τῇ δωδεκάτῃ ποιεῖται ἐν μηνὶ Ἀνθεστηριῶνι , ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ ἀπ’ Ἀθηναίων Ἴωνες ἔτι καὶ νῦν νομίζουσιν .
as that of the Olympian Jupiter, of the Pythian Apollo, of Terra and of Bacchus in Limnae, in whose honour the more ancient festival of Bacchus is held on the twelfth day of the month Anthesterion; as the Ionians also, who are descended from the Athenians, even to this day observe it.

2.15.4
1068
 ἵδρυται δὲ καὶ ἄλλα ἱερὰ ταύτῃ ἀρχαῖα .
And there are other ancient temples also situated in this quarter.

2.15.5
1069
 καὶ τῇ κρήνῃ τῇ νῦν μὲν τῶν τυράννων οὕτω σκευασάντων Ἐννεακρούνῳ καλουμένῃ , τὸ δὲ πάλαι φανερῶν τῶν πηγῶν οὐσῶν Καλλιρρόῃ ὠνομασμένῃ , ἐκεῖνοί τε ἐγγὺς οὔσῃ τὰ πλείστου ἄξια ἐχρῶντο , καὶ νῦν ἔτι ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀρχαίου πρό τε γαμικῶν καὶ ἐς ἄλλα τῶν ἱερῶν νομίζεται τῷ ὕδατι χρῆσθαι ·
The conduit too, which is now called Enneacrunus, [or, nine-pipes,] from the tyrants having so constituted it, but which had formerly the name of Calirrhoe, when the springs were open, the men of that day used, as it was near, on the most important occasions; and even at the present time they are accustomed, from the old fashion, to use the water before marriages, and for other sacred purposes.

2.15.6
1070
 καλεῖται δὲ διὰ τὴν παλαιὰν ταύτῃ κατοίκησιν καὶ ἡ ἀκρόπολις μέχρι τοῦδε ἔτι ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων πόλις .
Moreover, from their living of old in this quarter, the citadel even to this day is called by the Athenians the city.

2.16.1
1071
 τῇ τε οὖν ἐπὶ πολὺ κατὰ τὴν χώραν αὐτονόμῳ οἰκήσει μετεῖχον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , καὶ ἐπειδὴ ξυνῳκίσθησαν , διὰ τὸ ἔθος ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς ὅμως οἱ πλείους τῶν τε ἀρχαίων καὶ τῶν ὕστερον μέχρι τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου γενόμενοί τε καὶ οἰκήσαντες οὐ ῥᾳδίως πανοικεσίᾳ τὰς μεταναστάσεις ἐποιοῦντο , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἄρτι ἀνειληφότες τὰς κατασκευὰς μετὰ τὰ Μηδικά ·
For a long time then the Athenians enjoyed their independent life in the country; and after they were united, still, from the force of habit, the generality of them at that early period, and even afterwards, down to the time of this war, having with all their families settled and lived in the country, did not remove without reluctance, (especially as they had but lately recovered their establishments after the Median war,) but were distressed and grieved to leave their houses, and the temples which, according to the spirit of the ancient constitution, had always been regarded by them as the places of their hereditary worship;

2.16.2
1072
 ἐβαρύνοντο δὲ καὶ χαλεπῶς ἔφερον οἰκίας τε καταλείποντες καὶ ἱερὰ ἃ διὰ παντὸς ἦν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῆς κατὰ τὸ ἀρχαῖον πολιτείας πάτρια δίαιτάν τε μέλλοντες μεταβάλλειν καὶ οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἢ πόλιν τὴν αὑτοῦ ἀπολείπων ἕκαστος .
going, as they now were, to change their mode of life, and each of them doing what was equivalent to leaving his native city.

2.17.1
1073
 ἐπειδή τε ἀφίκοντο ἐς τὸ ἄστυ , ὀλίγοις μέν τισιν ὑπῆρχον οἰκήσεις καὶ παρὰ φίλων τινὰς ἢ οἰκείων καταφυγή , οἱ δὲ πολλοὶ τά τε ἐρῆμα τῆς πόλεως ᾤκησαν καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ καὶ τὰ ἡρῷα πάντα πλὴν τῆς ἀκροπόλεως καὶ τοῦ Ἐλευσινίου καὶ εἴ τι ἄλλο βεβαίως κλῃστὸν ἦν ·
When they came into the city, some few indeed had residences, and a place of refuge with some of their friends or relations; but the great bulk of them dwelt in the unoccupied parts of the city, and in all the temples and hero-chapels, except the Acropolis, and the temple of the Eleusinian Ceres, and any other that was kept constantly locked up.

2.17.1
1074
 τό τε Πελαργικὸν καλούμενον τὸ ὑπὸ τὴν ἀκρόπολιν , ὃ καὶ ἐπάρατόν τε ἦν μὴ οἰκεῖν καί τι καὶ Πυθικοῦ μαντείου ἀκροτελεύτιον τοιόνδε διεκώλυε , λέγον ὡς &quot; τὸ Πελαργικὸν ἀργὸν ἄμεινον ,’ ὅμως ὑπὸ τῆς παραχρῆμα ἀνάγκης ἐξῳκήθη .
The Pelasgium also, as it is called, under the Acropolis, which it was even forbidden by a curse to inhabit, and prohibited by the end of a Pythian oracle, to this effect, "the Pelasgium is better unoccupied," was, nevertheless, built over, from the immediate necessity of the case.

2.17.2
1075
 καί μοι δοκεῖ τὸ μαντεῖον τ- ἐναντίον ξυμβῆναι ἢ προσεδέχοντο ·
And, in my opinion, the oracle proved true in the contrary way to what was expected.

2.17.2
1076
 οὐ γὰρ διὰ τὴν παράνομον ἐνοίκησιν αἱ ξυμφοραὶ γενέσθαι τῇ πόλει , ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἡ ἀνάγκη τῆς οἰκήσεως , ὃν οὐκ ὀνομάζον τὸ μαντεῖον προῄδει μὴ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ ποτὲ αὐτὸ κατοικισθησόμενον .
For it was not, I think, because of their unlawfully inhabiting this spot, that such misfortunes

2.17.3
1077
 κατεσκευάσαντο δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς πύργοις τῶν τειχῶν πολλοὶ καὶ ὡς ἕκαστός που ἐδύνατο ·
Many, too, quartered themselves in the towers of the walls, and in whatever way each could:

2.17.3
1078
 οὐ γὰρ ἐχώρησε ξυνελθόντας αὐτοὺς ἡ πόλις , ἀλλ’ ὕστερον δὴ τά τε μακρὰ τείχη ᾤκησαν κατανειμάμενοι καὶ τοῦ Πειραιῶς τὰ πολλά .
for the city did not hold them when they were come all together; but subsequently they occupied the long walls, partitioning them out amongst them, and the greater part of the Piraeus.

2.17.4
1079
 ἅμα δὲ καὶ τῶν πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον ἥπτοντο , ξυμμάχους τε ἀγείροντες καὶ τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ ἑκατὸν νεῶν ἐπίπλουν ἐξαρτύοντες .
At the same time they also applied themselves to matters connected with the war; mustering their allies, and equipping an armament of a hundred ships for the Peloponnese.

2.17.5
1080
 καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐν τούτῳ παρασκευῆς ἦσαν .
The Athenians then were in this state of preparation.

2.18.1
1081
 ὁ δὲ στρατὸς τῶν Πελοποννησίων προϊὼν ἀφίκετο τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἐς Οἰνόην πρῶτον , ᾗπερ ἔμελλον ἐσβαλεῖν .
As for the army of the Peloponnesians, on the other hand, the first town it came to in Attica was Oenoe, at which point they intended to make their inroad.

2.18.1
1082
 καὶ ὡς ἐκαθέζοντο , προσβολὰς παρεσκευάζοντο τῷ τείχει ποιησόμενοι μηχαναῖς τε καὶ ἄλλῳ τρόπῳ ·
And having sat down before it, they prepared to make assaults on the wall, both with engines and in every other way;

2.18.2
1083
 ἡ γὰρ Οἰνόη οὖσα ἐν μεθορίοις τῆς Ἀττικῆς καὶ Βοιωτίας ἐτετείχιστο , καὶ αὐτῷ φρουρίῳ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐχρῶντο ὁπότε πόλεμος καταλάβοι .
For Oenoe, as lying on the frontiers of Attica and Boeotia, had been surrounded with a wall, and the Athenians used it as a garrisoned fort, whenever any war befell them.

2.18.2
1084
 τάς τε οὖν προσβολὰς ηὐτρεπίζοντο καὶ ἄλλως ἐνδιέτριψαν χρόνον περὶ αὐτήν .
They prepared then for assaulting it, and wasted their time about it to no purpose.

2.18.3
1085
 αἰτίαν τε οὐκ ἐλαχίστην Ἀρχίδαμος ἔλαβεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ , δοκῶν καὶ ἐν τῇ ξυναγωγῇ τοῦ πολέμου μαλακὸς εἶναι καὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐπιτήδειος , οὐ παραινῶν προθύμως πολεμεῖν ·
And from this delay, Archidamus incurred the greatest censure: though he had, even while the war was gathering, been thought to show a want of spirit, and to favour the Athenians, by not heartily recommending hostilities.

2.18.3
1086
 ἐπειδή τε ξυνελέγετο ὁ στρατός , ἥ τε ἐν τῷ Ἰσθμῷ ἐπιμονὴ γενομένη καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἄλλην πορείαν ἡ σχολαιότης διέβαλεν αὐτόν , μάλιστα δὲ ἡ ἐν τῇ Οἰνόῃ ἐπίσχεσις .
And again, after the army was mustered, the stay that was made at the Isthmus, and his slowness on the rest of the march, gave occasion for charges against him, but most of all his stopping at Oenoe.

2.18.4
1087
 οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐσεκομίζοντο ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ , καὶ ἐδόκουν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐπελθόντες ἂν διὰ τάχους πάντα ἔτι ἔξω καταλαβεῖν , εἰ μὴ διὰ τὴν ἐκείνου μέλλησιν .
For the Athenians during this time were carrying in their property, and the Peloponnesians thought that by advancing against them quickly they would have found every thing still out, but for his dilatoriness.

2.18.5
1088
 ἐν τοιαύτῃ μὲν ὀργῇ ὁ στρατὸς τὸν Ἀρχίδαμον ἐν τῇ καθέδρᾳ εἶχεν .
Such resentment did the army feel towards Archidamus during the siege.

2.18.5
1089
 ὁ δὲ προσδεχόμενος , ὡς λέγεται , τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τῆς γῆς ἔτι ἀκεραίου οὔσης ἐνδώσειν τι καὶ κατοκνήσειν περιιδεῖν αὐτὴν τμηθεῖσαν , ἀνεῖχεν .
But he, it is said, was waiting in expectation that the Athenians would give in, while their land was still unravaged, and would shrink from enduring to see it wasted.

2.19.1
1090
 ἐπειδὴ μέντοι προσβαλόντες τῇ Οἰνόῃ καὶ πᾶσαν ἰδέαν πειράσαντες οὐκ ἐδύναντο ἑλεῖν , οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι οὐδὲν ἐπεκηρυκεύοντο , οὕτω δὴ ὁρμήσαντες ἀπ’ αὐτῆς μετὰ τὰ ἐν Πλαταίᾳ τῶν ἐσελθόντων Θηβαίων γενόμενα ἡμέρᾳ ὀγδοηκοστῇ μάλιστα , θέρους καὶ τοῦ σίτου ἀκμάζοντος , ἐσέβαλον ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν ·
When, however, after assaulting Oenoe, and trying every method, they were unable to take the place, and the Athenians sent no herald to them, then indeed they set out from before it, and about eighty days after the events at Plataea, caused by the Thebans who had entered it, when the summer was at its height, and the corn ripe, they made their incursion into Attica;

2.19.1
1091
 ἡγεῖτο δὲ Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ Ζευξιδάμου , Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς .
Archidamus son of Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, being their commander.

2.19.2
1092
 καὶ καθεζόμενοι ἔτεμνον πρῶτον μὲν Ἐλευσῖνα καὶ τὸ Θριάσιον πεδίον καὶ τροπήν τινα τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἱππέων περὶ τοὺς Ῥείτους καλουμένους ἐποιήσαντο ·
After pitching their camp there, they first ravaged Eleusis and the Thriasian plain, and put to flight some Athenian cavalry near a place called Rheiti [or "the brooks"].

2.19.2
1093
 ἔπειτα προυχώρουν ἐν δεξιᾷ ἔχοντες τὸ Αἰγάλεων ὄρος διὰ Κρωπιᾶς , ἕως ἀφίκοντο ἐς Ἀχαρνάς , χωρίον μέγιστον τῆς Ἀττικῆς τῶν δήμων καλουμένων , καὶ καθεζόμενοι ἐς αὐτὸ στρατόπεδόν τε ἐποιήσαντο χρόνον τε πολὺν ἐμμείναντες ἔτεμνον .
Afterwards they continued their march, keeping Mount Aegaleos on their right through Cropaea, till they came to Acharnae, a place which is the largest of the [or townships,] as they are called, of Attica. And sitting down before it they formed an encampment, and stayed a long time in the place, and continued ravaging it.

2.20.1
1094
 γνώμῃ δὲ τοιᾷδε λέγεται τὸν Ἀρχίδαμον περί τε τὰς Ἀχαρνὰς ὡς ἐς μάχην ταξάμενον μεῖναι καὶ ἐς τὸ πεδίον ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἐσβολῇ οὐ καταβῆναι ·
It was with the following views that Archidamus is said to have remained in order of battle at Acharnae, and not to have gone down to the plain during that incursion.

2.20.2
1095
 τοὺς γὰρ Ἀθηναίους ἤλπιζεν , ἀκμάζοντάς τε νεότητι πολλῇ καὶ παρεσκευασμένους ἐς πόλεμον ὡς οὔπω πρότερον , ἴσως ἂν ἐπεξελθεῖν καὶ τὴν γῆν οὐκ ἂν περιιδεῖν τμηθῆναι .
He hoped that the Athenians, abounding as they were in numbers of young men, and prepared for war as they had never before been, would perhaps come out against him, and not stand still and see their land ravaged.

2.20.3
1096
 ἐπειδὴ οὖν αὐτῷ ἐς Ἐλευσῖνα καὶ τὸ Θριάσιον πεδίον οὐκ ἀπήντησαν , πεῖραν ἐποιεῖτο περὶ τὰς Ἀχαρνὰς καθήμενος εἰ ἐπεξίασιν ·
Since, then, they had not met him at Eleusis and the Thriasian plain, he pitched his camp at Acharnae, and tried whether they would now march out against him.

2.20.4
1097
 ἅμα μὲν γὰρ αὐτῷ ὁ χῶρος ἐπιτήδειος ἐφαίνετο ἐνστρατοπεδεῦσαι , ἅμα δὲ καὶ οἱ Ἀχαρνῆς μέγα μέρος ὄντες τῆς πόλεως ( τρισχίλιοι γὰρ ὁπλῖται ἐγένοντο ) οὐ περιόψεσθαι ἐδόκουν τὰ σφέτερα διαφθαρέντα , ἀλλ’ ὁρμήσειν καὶ τοὺς πάντας ἐς μάχην .
For he thought the post a favourable one for encamping in, and moreover that the Acharnians, forming as they did a large part of the state, (for they amounted to three thousand heavy-armed,) would not overlook the destruction of what belonged to them, but would stir up the whole army also to an engagement.

2.20.4
1098
 εἴ τε καὶ μὴ ἐπεξέλθοιεν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἐσβολῇ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἀδεέστερον ἤδη ἐς τὸ ὕστερον τό τε πεδίον τεμεῖν καὶ πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν πόλιν χωρήσεσθαι ·
If, on the other hand, the Athenians should come out against him during that incursion, he would then lay waste the plain with less fear in future, and advance to the city itself;

2.20.4
1099
 τοὺς γὰρ Ἀχαρνέας ἐστερημένους τῶν σφετέρων οὐχ ὁμοίως προθύμους ἔσεσθαι ὑπὲρ τῆς τῶν ἄλλων κινδυνεύειν , στάσιν δ’ ἐνέσεσθαι τῇ γνώμῃ .
for the Acharnians, after losing their own property, would not be so forward to run into danger for that of other people, but there would be a division in their counsels.

2.20.5
1100
 τοιαύτῃ μὲν διανοίᾳ ὁ Ἀρχίδαμος περὶ τὰς Ἀχαρνὰς ἦν .
It was with this view of the case that Archidamus remained at Acharnae.

2.21.1
1101
 Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ μέχρι μὲν οὗ περὶ Ἐλευσῖνα καὶ τὸ Θριάσιον πεδίον ὁ στρατὸς ἦν , καί τινα ἐλπίδα εἶχον ἐς τὸ ἐγγυτέρω αὐτοὺς μὴ προϊέναι , μεμνημένοι καὶ Πλειστοάνακτα τὸν Παυσανίου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλέα , ὅτε ἐσβαλὼν τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἐς Ἐλευσῖνα καὶ Θριῶζε στρατῷ Πελοποννησίων πρὸ τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου τέσσαρσι καὶ δέκα ἔτεσιν ἀνεχώρησε πάλιν ἐς τὸ πλέον οὐκέτι προελθών ( δι’ ὃ δὴ καὶ ἡ φυγὴ αὐτῷ ἐγένετο ἐκ Σπάρτης δόξαντι χρήμασι πεισθῆναι τὴν ἀναχώρησιν ) ·
As for the Athenians, so long as the army was in the neighbourhood of Eleusis and the Thriasian plain, they had some hope of its not advancing nearer; remembering the case of Pleistoanax, the son of Pausanias, the king of the Lacedaemonians, when with a Peloponnesian army he made an inroad into Attica, as far as Eleusis and Thria, fourteen years before this war, and retired again without advancing any further (for which reason indeed he was banished from Sparta, as he was thought to have been bribed to make the retreat).

2.21.2
1102
 ἐπειδὴ δὲ περὶ Ἀχαρνὰς εἶδον τὸν στρατὸν ἑξήκοντα σταδίους τῆς πόλεως ἀπέχοντα , οὐκέτι ἀνασχετὸν ἐποιοῦντο , ἀλλ’ αὐτοῖς , ὡς εἰκός , γῆς τεμνομένης ἐν τῷ ἐμφανεῖ , ὃ οὔπω ἑοράκεσαν οἵ γε νεώτεροι , οὐδ’ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι πλὴν τὰ Μηδικά , δεινὸν ἐφαίνετο καὶ ἐδόκει τοῖς τε ἄλλοις καὶ μάλιστα τῇ νεότητι ἐπεξιέναι καὶ μὴ περιορᾶν .
When, however, they saw the army at Acharnae, only sixty stades from the city, they considered it no longer bearable, and, as was natural, when their land was being ravaged before their eyes—a thing which the younger men had never yet seen, nor even the elder, except in the Persian wars—it was thought a great indignity, and all of them, especially the young men, determined to go out against them, and not to put up with it.

2.21.3
1103
 κατὰ ξυστάσεις τε γιγνόμενοι ἐν πολλῇ ἔριδι ἦσαν , οἱ μὲν κελεύοντες ἐπεξιέναι , οἱ δέ τινες οὐκ ἐῶντες .
They met therefore in knots and were in a state of great dissension, some urging them to go out, others dissuading them from it.

2.21.3
1104
 χρησμολόγοι τε ᾖδον χρησμοὺς παντοίους , ὧν ἀκροᾶσθαι ὡς ἕκαστος ὥρμητο .
Prophets too were repeating all kinds of oracles, to which they eagerly listened, as they were severally disposed.

2.21.3
1105
 οἵ τε Ἀχαρνῆς οἰόμενοι παρὰ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἐλαχίστην μοῖραν εἶναι Ἀθηναίων , ὡς αὐτῶν ἡ γῆ ἐτέμνετο , ἐνῆγον τὴν ἔξοδον μάλιστα .
The Acharnians especially, thinking that no considerable part of the Athenian forces was in their ranks, urged them to march out, while their land was being ravaged.

2.21.3
1106
 παντί τε τρόπῳ ἀνηρέθιστο ἡ πόλις , καὶ τὸν Περικλέα ἐν ὀργῇ εἶχον , καὶ ὧν παρῄνεσε πρότερον ἐμέμνηντο οὐδέν , ἀλλ’ ἐκάκιζον ὅτι στρατηγὸς ὢν οὐκ ἐπεξάγοι , αἴτιόν τε σφίσιν ἐνόμιζον πάντων ὧν ἔπασχον .
Nay, in every way the city was excited; and they were angry with Pericles, and remembered none of the advice which he had before given them, but abused him for not leading them out, as their general; and they regarded him as the author of all that they were suffering.

2.22.1
1107
 Περικλῆς δὲ ὁρῶν μὲν αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὸ παρὸν χαλεπαίνοντας καὶ οὐ τὰ ἄριστα φρονοῦντας , πιστεύων δὲ ὀρθῶς γιγνώσκειν περὶ τοῦ μὴ ἐπεξιέναι , ἐκκλησίαν τε οὐκ ἐποίει αὐτῶν οὐδὲ ξύλλογον οὐδένα , τοῦ μὴ ὀργῇ τι μᾶλλον ἢ γνώμῃ ξυνελθόντας ἐξαμαρτεῖν , τήν τε πόλιν ἐφύλασσε καὶ δι’ ἡσυχίας μάλιστα ὅσον ἐδύνατο εἶχεν .
He, in the mean time, seeing them angry at the present state of things, and not in the best mind; and being confident that he took a right view in not wishing to march out against the enemy, did not call them to an assembly, or any other meeting (that they might not commit themselves by coming together with more anger than judgment);

2.22.2
1108
 ἱππέας μέντοι ἐξέπεμπεν αἰεὶ τοῦ μὴ προδρόμους ἀπὸ τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐσπίπτοντας ἐς τοὺς ἀγροὺς τοὺς ἐγγὺς τῆς πόλεως κακουργεῖν ·
He was, however, continually sending out cavalry, to prevent the advanced guard of the army from falling on the estates near the city and ravaging them.

2.22.2
1109
 καὶ ἱππομαχία τις ἐγένετο βραχεῖα ἐν Φρυγίοις τῶν τε Ἀθηναίων τέλει ἑνὶ τῶν ἱππέων καὶ Θεσσαλοῖς μετ’ αὐτῶν πρὸς τοὺς Βοιωτῶν ἱππέας , ἐν ᾗ οὐκ ἔλασσον ἔσχον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Θεσσαλοί , μέχρι οὗ προσβοηθησάντων τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς τῶν ὁπλιτῶν τροπὴ ἐγένετο αὐτῶν καὶ ἀπέθανον τῶν Θεσσαλῶν καὶ Ἀθηναίων οὐ πολλοί ·
There was also a skirmish of cavalry at Phrygia, between one squadron of the Athenian horse, joined by some Thessalians, and the cavalry of the Boeotians, in which the Athenians and Thessalians had rather the advantage, until, on the heavy-armed coming to the succour of the Boeotians, they were routed, and some few of them killed.

2.22.2
1110
 ἀνείλοντο μέντοι αὐτοὺς αὐθημερὸν ἀσπόνδους .
They took up their bodies however on the same day without a truce.

2.22.3
1111
 καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι τροπαῖον τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ἔστησαν .
And the Peloponnesians erected a trophy the day after.

2.22.3
1112
 ἡ δὲ βοήθεια αὕτη τῶν Θεσσαλῶν κατὰ τὸ παλαιὸν ξυμμαχικὸν ἐγένετο τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , καὶ ἀφίκοντο παρ’ αὐτοὺς Λαρισαῖοι , Φαρσάλιοι , Παράσιοι , Κραννώνιοι , Πυράσιοι , Γυρτώνιοι , Φεραῖοι .
This assistance on the part of the Thessalians was given to the Athenians on the ground of their ancient alliance; and those who came to them consisted of Larissaeans, Pharsalians, Cranonians, Pyrasians, Gyrtonians, and Pheraeans.

2.22.3
1113
 ἡγοῦντο δὲ αὐτῶν ἐκ μὲν Λαρίσης Πολυμήδης καὶ Ἀριστόνους , ἀπὸ τῆς στάσεως ἑκάτερος , ἐκ δὲ Φαρσάλου Μένων ·
Their commanders were Polymedes and Aristonus, each from his own faction, and Menon from Pharsalus.

2.22.3
1114
 ἦσαν δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων κατὰ πόλεις ἄρχοντες .
The rest also had their commanders according to their respective cities.

2.23.1
1115
 οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι , ἐπειδὴ οὐκ ἐπεξῇσαν αὐτοῖς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς μάχην , ἄραντες ἐκ τῶν Ἀχαρνῶν ἐδῄουν τῶν δήμων τινὰς ἄλλους τῶν μεταξὺ Πάρνηθος καὶ Βριλησσοῦ ὄρους .
The Peloponnesians, when the Athenians did not come out against them to battle, broke up from before Acharnae, and proceeded to ravage some others of the townships between Mount Parnes and Brilessus.

2.23.2
1116
 ὄντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀπέστειλαν τὰς ἑκατὸν ναῦς περὶ Πελοπόννησον ἅσπερ παρεσκευάζοντο καὶ χιλίους ὁπλίτας ἐπ’ αὐτῶν καὶ τοξότας τετρακοσίους ·
While they were in the country, the Athenians despatched round the Peloponnese the hundred ships they were preparing, with a thousand heavy-armed on board, and four hundred bowmen.

2.23.2
1117
 ἐστρατήγει δὲ Καρκίνος τε ὁ Ξενοτίμου καὶ Πρωτέας ὁ Ἐπικλέους καὶ Σωκράτης ὁ Ἀντιγένους .
under the command of Caranus son of Xenotimus, Proteas son of Epicles, and Socrates son of Antigenes.

2.23.3
1118
 καὶ οἱ μὲν ἄραντες τῇ παρασκευῇ ταύτῃ περιέπλεον , οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι χρόνον ἐμμείναντες ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ὅσου εἶχον τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἀνεχώρησαν διὰ Βοιωτῶν , οὐχ ᾗπερ ἐσέβαλον ·
So they weighed anchor, and were cruising round with this armament; while the Peloponnesians, after staying in Attica the time for which they had provisions, retired through Boeotia, not by the same way they had made their inroad.

2.23.3
1119
 παριόντες δὲ Ὠρωπὸν τὴν γῆν τὴν Γραϊκὴν καλουμένην , ἣν νέμονται Ὠρώπιοι Ἀθηναίων ὑπήκοοι , ἐδῄωσαν .
and passing by Oropus, ravaged the Piraic territory, as it is called, which the Oropians inhabit as subjects of the Athenians.

2.23.3
1120
 ἀφικόμενοι δὲ ἐς Πελοπόννησον διελύθησαν κατὰ πόλεις ἕκαστοι .
On arriving at the Peloponnese, they were disbanded, and returned to their several cities.

2.24.1
1121
 ἀναχωρησάντων δὲ αὐτῶν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι φυλακὰς κατεστήσαντο κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν , ὥσπερ δὴ ἔμελλον διὰ παντὸς τοῦ πολέμου φυλάξειν ·
When they had retired, the Athenians set guards by land and by sea, as they intended to keep them through the whole war.

2.24.1
1122
 καὶ χίλια τάλαντα ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν τῇ ἀκροπόλει χρημάτων ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς ἐξαίρετα ποιησαμένοις χωρὶς θέσθαι καὶ μὴ ἀναλοῦν , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τῶν ἄλλων πολεμεῖν ·
And they resolved to take out and set apart a thousand talents from the money in the Acropolis, and not to spend them, but to carry on the war with their other resources.

2.24.1
1123
 ἢν δέ τις εἴπῃ ἢ ἐπιψηφίσῃ κινεῖν τὰ χρήματα ταῦτα ἐς ἄλλο τι , ἢν μὴ οἱ πολέμιοι νηίτῃ στρατῷ ἐπιπλέωσι τῇ πόλει καὶ δέῃ ἀμύνασθαι , θάνατον ζημίαν ἐπέθεντο .
And if any one should move or put to the vote a proposition for applying that money to any other purpose, except in case of the enemy sailing against the city with a naval armament, and its being necessary to defend themselves, they declared it a capital offence.

2.24.2
1124
 τριήρεις τε μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐξαιρέτους ἑκατὸν ἐποιήσαντο κατὰ τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν ἕκαστον τὰς βελτίστας , καὶ τριηράρχους αὐταῖς , ὧν μὴ χρῆσθαι μηδεμιᾷ ἐς ἄλλο τι ἢ μετὰ τῶν χρημάτων περὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ κινδύνου , ἢν δέῃ .
Together with this sum of money, they also laid by a hundred triremes, the best they had each year, and trierarchs for them; none of which were they to use except with the money, and in the same peril [as that was reserved for], should any such necessity arise.

2.25.1
1125
 οἱ δ’ ἐν ταῖς ἑκατὸν ναυσὶ περὶ Πελοπόννησον Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Κερκυραῖοι μετ’ αὐτῶν πεντήκοντα ναυσὶ προσβεβοηθηκότες καὶ ἄλλοι τινὲς τῶν ἐκεῖ ξυμμάχων ἄλλα τε ἐκάκουν περιπλέοντες καὶ ἐς Μεθώνην τῆς Λακωνικῆς ἀποβάντες τῷ τείχει προσέβαλον ὄντι ἀσθενεῖ καὶ ἀνθρώπων οὐκ ἐνόντων .
The Athenians on board the hundred ships around Peloponnese, and the Corcyraeans with them, who had come to their aid with fifty ships, and some others of the allies in those parts, ravaged other places as they cruised round, and landed at Methone in Laconia, and assaulted the wall, which was weak and had no men within it.

2.25.2
1126
 ἔτυχε δὲ περὶ τοὺς χώρους τούτους Βρασίδας ὁ Τέλλιδος ἀνὴρ Σπαρτιάτης φρουρὰν ἔχων , καὶ αἰσθόμενος ἐβοήθει τοῖς ἐν τῷ χωρίῳ μετὰ ὁπλιτῶν ἑκατόν .
Now Brasidas, son of Tellis, a Spartan, happened to be in command of a guard for the defence of those parts; and, on hearing of the attack, he came to the assistance of those in the place with a hundred heavy-armed.

2.25.2
1127
 διαδραμὼν δὲ τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατόπεδον ἐσκεδασμένον κατὰ τὴν χώραν καὶ πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος τετραμμένον ἐσπίπτει ἐς τὴν Μεθώνην καὶ ὀλίγους τινὰς ἐν τῇ ἐσδρομῇ ἀπολέσας τῶν μεθ’ αὑτοῦ τήν τε πόλιν περιεποίησε καὶ ἀπὸ τούτου τοῦ τολμήματος πρῶτος τῶν κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἐπῃνέθη ἐν Σπάρτῃ .
Dashing, therefore, through the army of the Athenians, which was scattered over the country, and had its attention directed towards the wall, he threw himself into Methone; and having lost a few of his own men in entering it, both saved the city, and from this daring deed was the first that received praise at Sparta in the course of the war.

2.25.3
1128
 οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἄραντες παρέπλεον , καὶ σχόντες τῆς Ἠλείας ἐς Φειὰν ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ δύο ἡμέρας καὶ προσβοηθήσαντας τῶν ἐκ τῆς κοίλης Ἤλιδος τριακοσίους λογάδας καὶ τῶν αὐτόθεν ἐκ τῆς περιοικίδος Ἠλείων μάχῃ ἐκράτησαν .
Upon this the Athenians weighed anchor, and coasted along; and landing at Pheia in Elis, they ravaged the territory for two days, and conquered in battle three hundred picked men, who had come to the rescue from the inhabitants of the Vale of Elis, and from the Eleans in the immediate neighbourhood.

2.25.4
1129
 ἀνέμου δὲ κατιόντος μεγάλου χειμαζόμενοι ἐν ἀλιμένῳ χωρίῳ , οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ ἐπέβησαν ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς καὶ περιέπλεον τὸν Ἰχθῦν καλούμενον τὴν ἄκραν ἐς τὸν ἐν τῇ Φειᾷ λιμένα , οἱ δὲ Μεσσήνιοι ἐν τούτῳ καὶ ἄλλοι τινὲς οἱ οὐ δυνάμενοι ἐπιβῆναι κατὰ γῆν χωρήσαντες τὴν Φειὰν αἱροῦσιν .
But a violent wind coming down upon them, being exposed to the storm in a harbourless place, the greater part of them went on board their ships, and sailed round the promontory called Ichthys, into the port at Pheia; but the Messenians, and some others who would not go on board, went in the mean time by land, and took Pheia.

2.25.5
1130
 καὶ ὕστερον αἵ τε νῆες περιπλεύσασαι ἀναλαμβάνουσιν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐξανάγονται ἐκλιπόντες Φειάν , καὶ τῶν Ἠλείων ἡ πολλὴ ἤδη στρατιὰ προσεβεβοηθήκει .
Afterwards the fleet sailed round and picked them up, and they evacuated the place and put out to sea; the main army of the Eleans having by this time come to its rescue.

2.25.5
1131
 παραπλεύσαντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ ἄλλα χωρία ἐδῄουν .
The Athenians then coasted along to other places and ravaged them.

2.26.1
1132
 ὑπὸ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον τοῦτον Ἀθηναῖοι τριάκοντα ναῦς ἐξέπεμψαν περὶ τὴν Λοκρίδα καὶ Εὐβοίας ἅμα φυλακήν ·
About the same time they sent out thirty ships to cruise about Locris, and also to serve as a guard for Euboea.

2.26.1
1133
 ἐστρατήγει δὲ αὐτῶν Κλεόπομπος ὁ Κλεινίου .
Their commander was Cleopompus, son of Cleinias.

2.26.2
1134
 καὶ ἀποβάσεις ποιησάμενος τῆς τε παραθαλασσίου ἔστιν ἃ ἐδῄωσε καὶ Θρόνιον εἷλεν , ὁμήρους τε ἔλαβεν αὐτῶν , καὶ ἐν Ἀλόπῃ τοὺς βοηθήσαντας Λοκρῶν μάχῃ ἐκράτησεν .
Their commander was Cleopompus, son of Clinias, who, making descents, ravaged certain places on the sea-coast, and captured Thronium, and took hostages from them; defeating also, in a battle at Alope, those of the Locrians who had come to the rescue.

2.27.1
1135
 ἀνέστησαν δὲ καὶ Αἰγινήτας τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει τούτῳ ἐξ Αἰγίνης Ἀθηναῖοι , αὐτούς τε καὶ παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας , ἐπικαλέσαντες οὐχ ἥκιστα τοῦ πολέμου σφίσιν αἰτίους εἶναι ·
This summer the Athenians also expelled the Aeginetans from their island, themselves, their children, and wives, charging them with being the chief authors of the war they were engaged in;

2.27.1
1136
 καὶ τὴν Αἴγιναν ἀσφαλέστερον ἐφαίνετο τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ ἐπικειμένην αὑτῶν πέμψαντας ἐποίκους ἔχειν .
besides which, it appeared safer to send settlers of their own to hold Aegina, lying so near as it does to the Peloponnese.

2.27.1
1137
 καὶ ἐξέπεμψαν ὕστερον οὐ πολλῷ ἐς αὐτὴν τοὺς οἰκήτορας .
No long time after, therefore, they sent the colonists to it.

2.27.2
1138
 ἐκπεσοῦσι δὲ τοῖς Αἰγινήταις οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἔδοσαν Θυρέαν οἰκεῖν καὶ τὴν γῆν νέμεσθαι , κατά τε τὸ Ἀθηναίων διάφορον καὶ ὅτι σφῶν εὐεργέται ἦσαν ὑπὸ τὸν σεισμὸν καὶ τῶν Εἱλώτων τὴν ἐπανάστασιν .
While to the Aeginetans who were expelled, the Lacedaemonians gave Thyrea to live in, and the territory to occupy, as well on the ground of their quarrel with the Athenians, as because they had been benefactors to themselves at the time of the earthquake and the insurrection of the Helots.

2.27.2
1139
 ἡ δὲ Θυρεᾶτις γῆ μεθορία τῆς Ἀργείας καὶ Λακωνικῆς ἐστίν , ἐπὶ θάλασσαν καθήκουσα .
The territory of Thyrea is on the frontier of Argolis and Laconia, stretching down to the sea.

2.27.2
1140
 καὶ οἱ μὲν αὐτῶν ἐνταῦθα ᾤκησαν , οἱ δ’ ἐσπάρησαν κατὰ τὴν ἄλλην Ἑλλάδα .
So some of them dwelt there, while others were scattered through the rest of Greece.

2.28.1
1141
 τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους νουμηνίᾳ κατὰ σελήνην , ὥσπερ καὶ μόνον δοκεῖ εἶναι γίγνεσθαι δυνατόν , ὁ ἥλιος ἐξέλιπε μετὰ μεσημβρίαν καὶ πάλιν ἀνεπληρώθη , γενόμενος μηνοειδὴς καὶ ἀστέρων τινῶν ἐκφανέντων .
The same summer, at the beginning of a new lunar month, (the only time at which it appears possible,) the sun was eclipsed after mid-day, and became full again after it had assumed a crescent form, and after some of the stars had shone out.

2.29.1
1142
 καὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει Νυμφόδωρον τὸν Πύθεω ἄνδρα Ἀβδηρίτην , οὗ εἶχε τὴν ἀδελφὴν Σιτάλκης , δυνάμενον παρ’ αὐτῷ μέγα οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι πρότερον πολέμιον νομίζοντες πρόξενον ἐποιήσαντο καὶ μετεπέμψαντο , βουλόμενοι Σιτάλκην σφίσι τὸν Τήρεω , Θρᾳκῶν βασιλέα , ξύμμαχον γενέσθαι .
It was also in the course of the same summer that Nymphodorus son of Pythes, a man of Abdera, whose sister was the wife of Sitalces, and who had great influence with that monarch, was made their by the Athenians, who had before considered him hostile to them, and was sent for by them, because they wished Sitalces, son of Teres, king of the Thracians, to become their ally.

2.29.2
1143
 ὁ δὲ Τήρης οὗτος ὁ τοῦ Σιτάλκου πατὴρ πρῶτος Ὀδρύσαις τὴν μεγάλην βασιλείαν ἐπὶ πλέον τῆς ἄλλης Θρᾴκης ἐποίησεν ·
Now this Teres, the father of Sitalces, was the first who founded the great kingdom of the Odrysae on a larger scale than those in the rest of Thrace;

2.29.2
1144
 πολὺ γὰρ μέρος καὶ αὐτόνομόν ἐστι Θρᾳκῶν .
for indeed a large part of the Thracians are independent.

2.29.3
1145
 Τηρεῖ δὲ τῷ Πρόκνην τὴν Πανδίονος ἀπ’ Ἀθηνῶν σχόντι γυναῖκα προσήκει ὁ Τήρης οὗτος οὐδέν , οὐδὲ τῆς αὐτῆς Θρᾴκης ἐγένοντο , ἀλλ’ ὁ μὲν ἐν Δαυλίᾳ τῆς Φωκίδος νῦν καλουμένης γῆς ὁ Τηρεὺς ᾤκει , τότε ὑπὸ Θρᾳκῶν οἰκουμένης , καὶ τὸ ἔργον τὸ περὶ τὸν Ἴτυν αἱ γυναῖκες ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ ἔπραξαν ( πολλοῖς δὲ καὶ τῶν ποιητῶν ἐν ἀηδόνος μνήμῃ Δαυλιὰς ἡ ὄρνις ἐπωνόμασται ) , εἰκός τε καὶ τὸ κῆδος Πανδίονα ξυνάψασθαι τῆς θυγατρὸς διὰ τοσούτου ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ τῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους μᾶλλον ἢ διὰ πολλῶν ἡμερῶν ἐς Ὀδρύσας ὁδοῦ .
This Teres is not at all connected with Tereus who married from Athens Procne, the daughter of Pandion; nor were they of the same part of Thrace. The latter lived in Daulis, a part of what is now called Phocis, which was then inhabited by Thracians. It was in this land that the women perpetrated the [cruel] deed to Itys, and by many of the poets, when they mention the nightingale, it is called the Daulian bird. Besides, it is probable that Pandion should have formed the connexion for his daughter [with one who lived] at that distance, with a view to mutual succour, rather than at the distance of several days' journey, [as it is] to the Odrysae.

2.29.3
1146
 Τήρης δὲ οὐδὲ τὸ αὐτὸ ὄνομα ἔχων βασιλεύς τε πρῶτος ἐν κράτει Ὀδρυσῶν ἐγένετο .
On the other hand, Teres, besides not having the same name, was the first king of the Odrysae that attained to any power.

2.29.4
1147
 οὗ δὴ ὄντα τὸν Σιτάλκην οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ξύμμαχον ἐποιοῦντο , βουλόμενοι σφίσι τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης χωρία καὶ Περδίκκαν ξυνεξελεῖν αὐτόν .
Sitalces then, being this man's son, the Athenians made their ally, wishing him to join them in conquering the Thrace-ward towns and Perdiccas.

2.29.5
1148
 ἐλθών τε ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ὁ Νυμφόδωρος τήν τε τοῦ Σιτάλκου ξυμμαχίαν ἐποίησε καὶ Σάδοκον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ Ἀθηναῖον τόν τε ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης πόλεμον ὑπεδέχετο καταλύσειν ·
So Nymphodorus came to Athens and concluded the alliance with Sitalces, and made his own son Sadocus a citizen of Athens, and undertook to bring to a close the war on the side of Thrace;

2.29.5
1149
 πείσειν γὰρ Σιτάλκην πέμπειν στρατιὰν Θρᾳκίαν Ἀθηναίοις ἱππέων τε καὶ πελταστῶν .
for he said he would persuade Sitalces to send the Athenians a Thracian force of cavalry and targeteers.

2.29.6
1150
 ξυνεβίβασε δὲ καὶ τὸν Περδίκκαν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Θέρμην αὐτῷ ἔπεισεν ἀποδοῦναι ·
Moreover, he reconciled Perdiccas to the Athenians, and also persuaded them to restore Therme to him;

2.29.6
1151
 ξυνεστράτευσέ τε εὐθὺς Περδίκκας ἐπὶ Χαλκιδέας μετὰ Ἀθηναίων καὶ Φορμίωνος .
and Perdiccas immediately joined in an expedition against the Chalcidians with the Athenians and Phormio.

2.29.7
1152
 οὕτω μὲν Σιτάλκης τε ὁ Τήρεω Θρᾳκῶν βασιλεὺς ξύμμαχος ἐγένετο Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Περδίκκας ὁ Ἀλεξάνδρου Μακεδόνων βασιλεύς .
Thus Sitalces son of Teres, king of the Thracians, became an ally of the Athenians, as also did Perdiccas son of Alexander, king of the Macedonians.

2.30.1
1153
 οἱ δ’ ἐν ταῖς ἑκατὸν ναυσὶν Ἀθηναῖοι ἔτι ὄντες περὶ Πελοπόννησον Σόλλιόν τε Κορινθίων πόλισμα αἱροῦσι καὶ παραδιδόασι Παλαιρεῦσιν Ἀκαρνάνων μόνοις τὴν γῆν καὶ πόλιν νέμεσθαι ·
Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred vessels, still cruising around the Peloponnese, took Sollium, a town belonging to the Corinthians, and gave it up to the Palaereans alone of the Acarnanians, to enjoy the territory and city;

2.30.1
1154
 καὶ Ἀστακόν , ἧς Εὔαρχος ἐτυράννει , λαβόντες κατὰ κράτος καὶ ἐξελάσαντες αὐτὸν τὸ χωρίον ἐς τὴν ξυμμαχίαν προσεποιήσαντο .
and having stormed Astacus, of which Evarchus was tyrant, they expelled him, and won the place for their confederacy.

2.30.2
1155
 ἐπί τε Κεφαλληνίαν τὴν νῆσον προσπλεύσαντες προσηγάγοντο ἄνευ μάχης ·
They then sailed to the island of Cephallenia, and brought it over to their side without fighting.

2.30.2
1156
 κεῖται δὲ ἡ Κεφαλληνία κατὰ Ἀκαρνανίαν καὶ Λευκάδα τετράπολις οὖσα , Παλῆς , Κράνιοι , Σαμαῖοι , Προνναῖοι .
Cephallenia lies opposite Acarnania and Leucas, and consists of four states, the Paleans, Cranians, Samaeans, and Pronaeans.

2.30.2
1157
 ὕστερον δ’ οὐ πολλῷ ἀνεχώρησαν αἱ νῆες ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας .
Not long after, the ships returned to Athens.

2.31.1
1158
 περὶ δὲ τὸ φθινόπωρον τοῦ θέρους τούτου Ἀθηναῖοι πανδημεί , αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ μέτοικοι , ἐσέβαλον ἐς τὴν Μεγαρίδα Περικλέους τοῦ Ξανθίππου στρατηγοῦντος .
About the autumn of this summer, the Athenians invaded the Megarid with all their forces, themselves and the resident aliens, under the command of Pericles son of Xanthippus.

2.31.1
1159
 καὶ οἱ περὶ Πελοπόννησον Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν ταῖς ἑκατὸν ναυσίν ( ἔτυχον γὰρ ἤδη ἐν Αἰγίνῃ ὄντες ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀνακομιζόμενοι ) ὡς ᾔσθοντο τοὺς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως πανστρατιᾷ ἐν Μεγάροις ὄντας , ἔπλευσαν παρ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ ξυνεμείχθησαν .
And the Athenians in the hundred ships around the Peloponnese, (for they happened at this time to be at Aegina on their return home,) finding that the men of the city were in full force at Megara, sailed and joined them.

2.31.2
1160
 στρατόπεδόν τε μέγιστον δὴ τοῦτο ἁθρόον Ἀθηναίων ἐγένετο , ἀκμαζούσης ἔτι τῆς πόλεως καὶ οὔπω νενοσηκυίας ·
And this was certainly the largest army of the Athenians that ever assembled together, as the city was at the height of its strength, and not yet afflicted with the plague;

2.31.2
1161
 μυρίων γὰρ ὁπλιτῶν οὐκ ἐλάσσους ἦσαν αὐτοὶ Ἀθηναῖοι ( χωρὶς δὲ αὐτοῖς οἱ ἐν Ποτειδαίᾳ τρισχίλιοι ἦσαν ) , μέτοικοι δὲ ξυνεσέβαλον οὐκ ἐλάσσους τρισχιλίων ὁπλιτῶν , χωρὶς δὲ ὁ ἄλλος ὅμιλος ψιλῶν οὐκ ὀλίγος .
for of the Athenians themselves there were not fewer than ten thousand heavy-armed, (besides which they had the three thousand at Potidaea,) and of resident aliens who joined them in the incursion not fewer than three thousand heavy-armed; and added to these, there was all the crowd of light-armed in great numbers.

2.31.2
1162
 δῃώσαντες δὲ τὰ πολλὰ τῆς γῆς ἀνεχώρησαν .
After ravaging the greater part of the territory, they returned.

2.31.3
1163
 ἐγένοντο δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι ὕστερον ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ κατὰ ἔτος ἕκαστον ἐσβολαὶ Ἀθηναίων ἐς τὴν Μεγαρίδα καὶ ἱππέων καὶ πανστρατιᾷ , μέχρι οὗ Νίσαια ἑάλω ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων .
Other incursions into the Megarid were also afterwards made annually by the Athenians in the course of the war, both with their cavalry and with all their force, until Nisaea was taken by them.

2.32.1
1164
 ἐτειχίσθη δὲ καὶ Ἀταλάντη ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων φρούριον τοῦ θέρους τούτου τελευτῶντος , ἡ ἐπὶ Λοκροῖς τοῖς Ὀπουντίοις νῆσος ἐρήμη πρότερον οὖσα , τοῦ μὴ λῃστὰς ἐκπλέοντας ἐξ Ὀποῦντος καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Λοκρίδος κακουργεῖν τὴν Εὔβοιαν .
Moreover Atalanta, the island near the Opuntian Locrians, which had previously been unoccupied, was fortified by the Athenians as a stronghold at the close of this summer, to prevent privateers from sailing out from Opus and the rest of Locris, and plundering Euboea.

2.32.1
1165
 ταῦτα μὲν ἐν τῷ θέρει τούτῳ μετὰ τὴν Πελοποννησίων ἐκ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀναχώρησιν ἐγένετο .
These were the events which occurred in the course of this summer, after the return of the Peloponnesians from Attica.

2.33.1
1166
 τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος Εὔαρχος ὁ Ἀκαρνὰν βουλόμενος ἐς τὴν Ἀστακὸν κατελθεῖν πείθει Κορινθίους τεσσαράκοντα ναυσὶ καὶ πεντακοσίοις καὶ χιλίοις ὁπλίταις ἑαυτὸν κατάγειν πλεύσαντας , καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπικούρους τινὰς προσεμισθώσατο ·
The following winter Evarchus the Acarnanian, wishing to return to Astacus, persuaded the Corinthians to sail with forty ships and fifteen hundred heavy-armed and restore him, he himself hiring some auxiliaries besides:

2.33.1
1167
 ἦρχον δὲ τῆς στρατιᾶς Εὐφαμίδας τε ὁ Ἀριστωνύμου καὶ Τιμόξενος ὁ Τιμοκράτους καὶ Εὔμαχος ὁ Χρύσιδος .
the commanders of the army were Euphamidas son of Aristonymus, Timoxenus son of Timocrates, and Eumachus son of Chrysis.

2.33.2
1168
 καὶ πλεύσαντες κατήγαγον ·
So they sailed and restored him;

2.33.2
1169
 καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Ἀκαρνανίας τῆς περὶ θάλασσαν ἔστιν ἃ χωρία βουλόμενοι προσποιήσασθαι καὶ πειραθέντες , ὡς οὐκ ἐδύναντο , ἀπέπλεον ἐπ’ οἴκου .
and wishing to gain certain places in the rest of Acarnania, along the coast, and having made an attempt without being able to succeed, they sailed back homeward.

2.33.3
1170
 σχόντες δ’ ἐν τῷ παράπλῳ ἐς Κεφαλληνίαν καὶ ἀπόβασιν ποιησάμενοι ἐς τὴν Κρανίων γῆν , ἀπατηθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἐξ ὁμολογίας τινὸς ἄνδρας τε ἀποβάλλουσι σφῶν αὐτῶν , ἐπιθεμένων ἀπροσδοκήτοις τῶν Κρανίων , καὶ βιαιότερον ἀναγαγόμενοι ἐκομίσθησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
Having landed, as they coasted along, on Cephallenia, and made a descent on the territory of the Cranians, they were deceived by them after an arrangement that they had come to, and lost some of their men in an unexpected attack of the Cranians; then, having put out to sea with some precipitation, they returned home.

2.34.1
1171
 ἐν δὲ τῷ αὐτῷ χειμῶνι Ἀθηναῖοι τῷ πατρίῳ νόμῳ χρώμενοι δημοσίᾳ ταφὰς ἐποιήσαντο τῶν ἐν τῷδε τῷ πολέμῳ πρώτων ἀποθανόντων τρόπῳ τοιῷδε .
In the course of this winter the Athenians, in accordance with the custom of their forefathers, buried at the public expense those who had first fallen in this war, after the following manner.

2.34.2
1172
 τὰ μὲν ὀστᾶ προτίθενται τῶν ἀπογενομένων πρότριτα σκηνὴν ποιήσαντες , καὶ ἐπιφέρει τῷ αὑτοῦ ἕκαστος ἤν τι βούληται ·
Having erected a tent, they lay out the bones of the dead three days before, and each one brings to his own relative whatever [funeral offering] he pleases.

2.34.3
1173
 ἐπειδὰν δὲ ἡ ἐκφορὰ ᾖ , λάρνακας κυπαρισσίνας ἄγουσιν ἅμαξαι , φυλῆς ἑκάστης μίαν ·
When the funeral procession takes place, cars convey coffins of cypress wood, one for each tribe;

2.34.3
1174
 ἔνεστι δὲ τὰ ὀστᾶ ἧς ἕκαστος ἦν φυλῆς .
in which are laid the bones of every man, according to the tribe to which he belonged;

2.34.3
1175
 μία δὲ κλίνη κενὴ φέρεται ἐστρωμένη τῶν ἀφανῶν , οἳ ἂν μὴ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐς ἀναίρεσιν .
and one empty bier is carried, spread in honour of the missing, whose bodies could not be found to be taken up.

2.34.4
1176
 ξυνεκφέρει δὲ ὁ βουλόμενος καὶ ἀστῶν καὶ ξένων , καὶ γυναῖκες πάρεισιν αἱ προσήκουσαι ἐπὶ τὸν τάφον ὀλοφυρόμεναι .
Whoever wishes, both of citizens and strangers, joins in the procession; and their female relatives attend at the burial to make the wailings.

2.34.5
1177
 τιθέασιν οὖν ἐς τὸ δημόσιον σῆμα , ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ καλλίστου προαστείου τῆς πόλεως , καὶ αἰεὶ ἐν αὐτῷ θάπτουσι τοὺς ἐκ τῶν πολέμων , πλήν γε τοὺς ἐν Μαραθῶνι ·
They lay them then in the public sepulchre, which is in the fairest suburb of the city, and in which they always bury those who have fallen in the wars (except, at least, those who fell at Marathon;

2.34.5
1178
 ἐκείνων δὲ διαπρεπῆ τὴν ἀρετὴν κρίναντες αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν τάφον ἐποίησαν .
but to them, as they considered their valour distinguished above that of all others, they gave a burial on the very spot).

2.34.6
1179
 ἐπειδὰν δὲ κρύψωσι γῇ , ἀνὴρ ᾑρημένος ὑπὸ τῆς πόλεως , ὃς ἂν γνώμῃ τε δοκῇ μὴ ἀξύνετος εἶναι καὶ ἀξιώσει προήκῃ , λέγει ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς ἔπαινον τὸν πρέποντα ·
After they have laid them in the ground, a man chosen by the state—one who in point of intellect is considered talented, and in dignity is pre-eminent—speaks over them such a panegyric as may be appropriate;

2.34.6
1180
 μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἀπέρχονται .
after which they all retire.

2.34.7
1181
 ὧδε μὲν θάπτουσιν ·
In this way they bury them:

2.34.7
1182
 καὶ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ πολέμου , ὁπότε ξυμβαίη αὐτοῖς , ἐχρῶντο τῷ νόμῳ .
and through the whole of the war, whenever they had occasion, they observed the established custom.

2.34.8
1183
 ἐπὶ δ’ οὖν τοῖς πρώτοις τοῖσδε Περικλῆς ὁ Ξανθίππου ᾑρέθη λέγειν .
Over these who were first buried at any rate, Pericles son of Xanthippus was chosen to speak.

2.34.8
1184
 καὶ ἐπειδὴ καιρὸς ἐλάμβανε , προελθὼν ἀπὸ τοῦ σήματος ἐπὶ βῆμα ὑψηλὸν πεποιημένον , ὅπως ἀκούοιτο ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον τοῦ ὁμίλου , ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
And when the time for doing so came, advancing from the sepulchre on to a platform, which had been raised to some height, that he might be heard over as great a part of the crowd as possible, he spoke to the following effect:

2.35.1
1185
 &quot; οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ τῶν ἐνθάδε ἤδη εἰρηκότων ἐπαινοῦσι τὸν προσθέντα τῷ νόμῳ τὸν λόγον τόνδε , ὡς καλὸν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐκ τῶν πολέμων θαπτομένοις ἀγορεύεσθαι αὐτόν .
"The greater part of those who ere now have spoken in this place, have been accustomed to praise the man who introduced this oration into the law;

2.35.1
1186
 ἐμοὶ δὲ ἀρκοῦν ἂν ἐδόκει εἶναι ἀνδρῶν ἀγαθῶν ἔργῳ γενομένων ἔργῳ καὶ δηλοῦσθαι τὰς τιμάς , οἷα καὶ νῦν περὶ τὸν τάφον τόνδε δημοσίᾳ παρασκευασθέντα ὁρᾶτε , καὶ μὴ ἐν ἑνὶ ἀνδρὶ πολλῶν ἀρετὰς κινδυνεύεσθαι εὖ τε καὶ χεῖρον εἰπόντι πιστευθῆναι .
considering it a right thing that it should be delivered over those who are buried after falling in battle. To me, however, it would have appeared sufficient, that when men had shown themselves brave by deeds, their honours also should be displayed by deeds—as you now see in the case of this burial, prepared at the public expense—and not that the virtues of many should be perilled in one individual, for credit to be given him according as he expresses himself well or ill.

2.35.2
1187
 χαλεπὸν γὰρ τὸ μετρίως εἰπεῖν ἐν ᾧ μόλις καὶ ἡ δόκησις τῆς ἀληθείας βεβαιοῦται .
For it is difficult to speak with propriety on a subject on which even the impression of one's truthfulness is with difficulty established.

2.35.2
1188
 ὅ τε γὰρ ξυνειδὼς καὶ εὔνους ἀκροατὴς τάχ’ ἄν τι ἐνδεεστέρως πρὸς ἃ βούλεταί τε καὶ ἐπίσταται νομίσειε δηλοῦσθαι , ὅ τε ἄπειρος ἔστιν ἃ καὶ πλεονάζεσθαι , διὰ φθόνον , εἴ τι ὑπὲρ τὴν αὑτοῦ φύσιν ἀκούοι .
For the hearer who is acquainted [with the facts], and kindly disposed [towards those who performed them], might perhaps think them somewhat imperfectly set forth, compared with what he both wishes and knows; while he who is unacquainted with them might think that some points were even exaggerated, being led to this conclusion by envy, should he hear any thing surpassing his own natural powers.

2.35.2
1189
 μέχρι γὰρ τοῦδε ἀνεκτοὶ οἱ ἔπαινοί εἰσι περὶ ἑτέρων λεγόμενοι , ἐς ὅσον ἂν καὶ αὐτὸς ἕκαστος οἴηται ἱκανὸς εἶναι δρᾶσαί τι ὧν ἤκουσεν ·
For praises spoken of others are only endured so far as each one thinks that he is himself also capable of doing any of the things he hears;

2.35.2
1190
 τῷ δὲ ὑπερβάλλοντι αὐτῶν φθονοῦντες ἤδη καὶ ἀπιστοῦσιν .
but when they exceed that limit, envy supervenes, and with it incredulity."

2.35.3
1191
 ἐπειδὴ δὲ τοῖς πάλαι οὕτως ἐδοκιμάσθη ταῦτα καλῶς ἔχειν , χρὴ καὶ ἐμὲ ἑπόμενον τῷ νόμῳ πειρᾶσθαι ὑμῶν τῆς ἑκάστου βουλήσεώς τε καὶ δόξης τυχεῖν ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον .
but that which exceeds their own capacity men at once envy and disbelieve. since, however our ancestors judged this to be a right custom, I too, in obedience to the law, must endeavour to meet the wishes and views of every one, as far as possible.

2.36.1
1192
 &quot; ἄρξομαι δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν προγόνων πρῶτον ·
"I will begin then with our ancestors first:

2.36.1
1193
 δίκαιον γὰρ αὐτοῖς καὶ πρέπον δὲ ἅμα ἐν τῷ τοιῷδε τὴν τιμὴν ταύτην τῆς μνήμης δίδοσθαι .
for it is just, and becoming too at the same time, that on such an occasion the honour of being thus mentioned should be paid them.

2.36.1
1194
 τὴν γὰρ χώραν οἱ αὐτοὶ αἰεὶ οἰκοῦντες διαδοχῇ τῶν ἐπιγιγνομένων μέχρι τοῦδε ἐλευθέραν δι’ ἀρετὴν παρέδοσαν .
For always inhabiting the country without change, through a long succession of posterity, by their valour they transmitted it free to this very time.

2.36.2
1195
 καὶ ἐκεῖνοί τε ἄξιοι ἐπαίνου καὶ ἔτι μᾶλλον οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ·
Justly then may they claim to be commended; and more justly still may our own fathers.

2.36.2
1196
 κτησάμενοι γὰρ πρὸς οἷς ἐδέξαντο ὅσην ἔχομεν ἀρχὴν οὐκ ἀπόνως ἡμῖν τοῖς νῦν προσκατέλιπον .
For in addition to what they inherited, they acquired the great empire which we possess, and by painful exertions bequeathed it to us of the present day:

2.36.3
1197
 τὰ δὲ πλείω αὐτῆς αὐτοὶ ἡμεῖς οἵδε οἱ νῦν ἔτι ὄντες μάλιστα ἐν τῇ καθεστηκυίᾳ ἡλικίᾳ ἐπηυξήσαμεν καὶ τὴν πόλιν τοῖς πᾶσι παρεσκευάσαμεν καὶ ἐς πόλεμον καὶ ἐς εἰρήνην αὐταρκεστάτην .
though to most part of it have additions been made by ourselves here, who are still, generally speaking, in the vigour of life; and we have furnished our city with every thing, so as to be most self-sufficient both for peace and for war.

2.36.4
1198
 ὧν ἐγὼ τὰ μὲν κατὰ πολέμους ἔργα , οἷς ἕκαστα ἐκτήθη , ἢ εἴ τι αὐτοὶ ἢ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν βάρβαρον ἢ Ἕλληνα πολέμιον ἐπιόντα προθύμως ἠμυνάμεθα , μακρηγορεῖν ἐν εἰδόσιν οὐ βουλόμενος ἐάσω ·
Now with regard to our military achievements, by which each possession was gained, whether in any case it were ourselves, or our fathers, that repelled with spirit hostilities brought against us by barbarian or Greek;

2.36.4
1199
 ἀπὸ δὲ οἵας τε ἐπιτηδεύσεως ἤλθομεν ἐπ’ αὐτὰ καὶ μεθ’ οἵας πολιτείας καὶ τρόπων ἐξ οἵων μεγάλα ἐγένετο , ταῦτα δηλώσας πρῶτον εἶμι καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν τῶνδε ἔπαινον , νομίζων ἐπί τε τῷ παρόντι οὐκ ἂν ἀπρεπῆ λεχθῆναι αὐτὰ καὶ τὸν πάντα ὅμιλον καὶ ἀστῶν καὶ ξένων ξύμφορον εἶναι ἐπακοῦσαι αὐτῶν .
as I do not wish to enlarge on the subject before you who are well acquainted with it, I will pass them over. But by what a mode of life we attained to our power, and by what form of government and owing to what habits it became so great, I will explain these points first, and then proceed to the eulogy of these men; as I consider that on the present occasion they will not be inappropriately mentioned, and that it is profitable for the whole assembly, both citizens and strangers, to listen to them.

2.37.1
1200
 &quot; χρώμεθα γὰρ πολιτείᾳ οὐ ζηλούσῃ τοὺς τῶν πέλας νόμους , παράδειγμα δὲ μᾶλλον αὐτοὶ ὄντες τισὶν ἢ μιμούμενοι ἑτέρους .
"For we enjoy a form of government which does not copy the laws of our neighbours; but we are ourselves rather a pattern to others than imitators of them.

2.37.1
1201
 καὶ ὄνομα μὲν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐς ὀλίγους ἀλλ’ ἐς πλείονας οἰκεῖν δημοκρατία κέκληται ·
In name, from its not being administered for the benefit of the few, but of the many it is called a democracy;

2.37.1
1202
 μέτεστι δὲ κατὰ μὲν τοὺς νόμους πρὸς τὰ ἴδια διάφορα πᾶσι τὸ ἴσον , κατὰ δὲ τὴν ἀξίωσιν , ὡς ἕκαστος ἔν τῳ εὐδοκιμεῖ , οὐκ ἀπὸ μέρους τὸ πλέον ἐς τὰ κοινὰ ἢ ἀπ’ ἀρετῆς προτιμᾶται , οὐδ’ αὖ κατὰ πενίαν , ἔχων γέ τι ἀγαθὸν δρᾶσαι τὴν πόλιν , ἀξιώματος ἀφανείᾳ κεκώλυται .
but with regard to its laws, all enjoy equality, as concerns their private differences; while with regard to public rank, according as each man has reputation for any thing, he is preferred for public honours, not so much from consideration of party, as of merit; nor, again, on the ground of poverty, while he is able to do the state any good service, is he prevented by the obscurity of his position.

2.37.2
1203
 ἐλευθέρως δὲ τά τε πρὸς τὸ κοινὸν πολιτεύομεν καὶ ἐς τὴν πρὸς ἀλλήλους τῶν καθ’ ἡμέραν ἐπιτηδευμάτων ὑποψίαν , οὐ δι’ ὀργῆς τὸν πέλας , εἰ καθ’ ἡδονήν τι δρᾷ , ἔχοντες , οὐδὲ ἀζημίους μέν , λυπηρὰς δὲ τῇ ὄψει ἀχθηδόνας προστιθέμενοι .
We are liberal then in our public administration; and with regard to mutual jealousy of our daily pursuits, we are not angry with our neighbor, if he does any thing to please himself; nor wear on our countenance offensive looks, which though harmless, are yet unpleasant.

2.37.3
1204
 ἀνεπαχθῶς δὲ τὰ ἴδια προσομιλοῦντες τὰ δημόσια διὰ δέος μάλιστα οὐ παρανομοῦμεν , τῶν τε αἰεὶ ἐν ἀρχῇ ὄντων ἀκροάσει καὶ τῶν νόμων , καὶ μάλιστα αὐτῶν ὅσοι τε ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ τῶν ἀδικουμένων κεῖνται καὶ ὅσοι ἄγραφοι ὄντες αἰσχύνην ὁμολογουμένην φέρουσιν .
While, however, in private matters we live together agreeably, in public matters, under the influence of fear, we most carefully abstain from transgression, through our obedience to those who are from time to time in office, and to the laws; especially such of them as are enacted for the benefit of the injured, and such as, though unwritten, bring acknowledged disgrace [on those who break them].

2.38.1
1205
 &quot; καὶ μὴν καὶ τῶν πόνων πλείστας ἀναπαύλας τῇ γνώμῃ ἐπορισάμεθα , ἀγῶσι μέν γε καὶ θυσίαις διετησίοις νομίζοντες , ἰδίαις δὲ κατασκευαῖς εὐπρεπέσιν , ὧν καθ’ ἡμέραν ἡ τέρψις τὸ λυπηρὸν ἐκπλήσσει .
"Moreover, we have provided for our spirits the most numerous recreations from labours, by celebrating games and sacrifices through the whole year, and by maintaining elegant private establishments, of which the daily gratification drives away sadness.

2.38.2
1206
 ἐπεσέρχεται δὲ διὰ μέγεθος τῆς πόλεως ἐκ πάσης γῆς τὰ πάντα , καὶ ξυμβαίνει ἡμῖν μηδὲν οἰκειοτέρᾳ τῇ ἀπολαύσει τὰ αὐτοῦ ἀγαθὰ γιγνόμενα καρποῦσθαι ἢ καὶ τὰ τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων .
Owing to the greatness too of our city, every thing from every land is imported into it; and it is our lot to reap with no more peculiar enjoyment the good things which are produced here, than those of the rest of the world likewise.

2.39.1
1207
 &quot; διαφέρομεν δὲ καὶ ταῖς τῶν πολεμικῶν μελέταις τῶν ἐναντίων τοῖσδε .
"In the studies of war also we differ from our enemies in the following respects.

2.39.1
1208
 τήν τε γὰρ πόλιν κοινὴν παρέχομεν , καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅτε ξενηλασίαις ἀπείργομέν τινα ἢ μαθήματος ἢ θεάματος , ὃ μὴ κρυφθὲν ἄν τις τῶν πολεμίων ἰδὼν ὠφεληθείη , πιστεύοντες οὐ ταῖς παρασκευαῖς τὸ πλέον καὶ ἀπάταις ἢ τῷ ἀφ’ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἐς τὰ ἔργα εὐψύχῳ ·
We throw our city open to all, and never, by the expulsion of strangers, exclude any one from either learning or observing things, by seeing which unconcealed any of our enemies might gain an advantage; for we trust not so much to preparations and stratagems, as to our own valour for daring deeds.

2.39.1
1209
 καὶ ἐν ταῖς παιδείαις οἱ μὲν ἐπιπόνῳ ἀσκήσει εὐθὺς νέοι ὄντες τὸ ἀνδρεῖον μετέρχονται , ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀνειμένως διαιτώμενοι οὐδὲν ἧσσον ἐπὶ τοὺς ἰσοπαλεῖς κινδύνους χωροῦμεν .
Again, as to our modes of education, aim at the acquisition of a manly character, by laborious training from their very youth; while though living at our ease, no less boldly advance to meet equal dangers.

2.39.2
1210
 τεκμήριον δέ ·
As a proof of this,

2.39.2
1211
 οὔτε γὰρ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καθ’ ἑαυτούς , μεθ’ ἁπάντων δὲ ἐς τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν στρατεύουσι , τήν τε τῶν πέλας αὐτοὶ ἐπελθόντες οὐ χαλεπῶς ἐν τῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ τοὺς περὶ τῶν οἰκείων ἀμυνομένους μαχόμενοι τὰ πλείω κρατοῦμεν .
the Lacedaemonians never march against our country singly, but with all [their confederates] together: while we, generally speaking, have no difficulty in conquering in battle upon hostile ground those who are standing up in defence of their own.

2.39.3
1212
 ἁθρόᾳ τε τῇ δυνάμει ἡμῶν οὐδείς πω πολέμιος ἐνέτυχε διὰ τὴν τοῦ ναυτικοῦ τε ἅμα ἐπιμέλειαν καὶ τὴν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐπὶ πολλὰ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἐπίπεμψιν ·
And no enemy ever yet encountered our whole united force, through our attending at the same time to our navy, and sending our troops by land on so many different services:

2.39.3
1213
 ἢν δέ που μορίῳ τινὶ προσμείξωσι , κρατήσαντές τέ τινας ἡμῶν πάντας αὐχοῦσιν ἀπεῶσθαι καὶ νικηθέντες ὑφ’ ἁπάντων ἡσσῆσθαι .
but wherever they have engaged with any part of it, if they conquer only some of us, they boast that we were all routed by them; and if they are conquered, they say it was by all that they were beaten.

2.39.4
1214
 καίτοι εἰ ῥᾳθυμίᾳ μᾶλλον ἢ πόνων μελέτῃ καὶ μὴ μετὰ νόμων τὸ πλέον ἢ τρόπων ἀνδρείας ἐθέλομεν κινδυνεύειν , περιγίγνεται ἡμῖν τοῖς τε μέλλουσιν ἀλγεινοῖς μὴ προκάμνειν , καὶ ἐς αὐτὰ ἐλθοῦσι μὴ ἀτολμοτέρους τῶν αἰεὶ μοχθούντων φαίνεσθαι , καὶ ἔν τε τούτοις τὴν πόλιν ἀξίαν εἶναι θαυμάζεσθαι καὶ ἔτι ἐν ἄλλοις .
And yet if with careless ease rather than with laborious practice, and with a courage which is the result not so much of laws as of natural disposition, we are willing to face danger, we have the advantage of not suffering beforehand from coming troubles, and of proving ourselves, when we are involved in them, no less bold than those who are always toiling; so that our country is worthy of admiration in these respects, and in others besides.

2.40.1
1215
 &quot; φιλοκαλοῦμέν τε γὰρ μετ’ εὐτελείας καὶ φιλοσοφοῦμεν ἄνευ μαλακίας ·
"For we study taste with economy, and philosophy without effeminacy; and employ wealth rather for opportunity of action than for boastfulness of talking;

2.40.1
1216
 πλούτῳ τε ἔργου μᾶλλον καιρῷ ἢ λόγου κόμπῳ χρώμεθα , καὶ τὸ πένεσθαι οὐχ ὁμολογεῖν τινὶ αἰσχρόν , ἀλλὰ μὴ διαφεύγειν ἔργῳ αἴσχιον .
while poverty is nothing disgraceful for a man to confess, but not to escape it by exertion is more disgraceful.

2.40.2
1217
 ἔνι τε τοῖς αὐτοῖς οἰκείων ἅμα καὶ πολιτικῶν ἐπιμέλεια , καὶ ἑτέροις πρὸς ἔργα τετραμμένοις τὰ πολιτικὰ μὴ ἐνδεῶς γνῶναι ·
Again, the same men can attend at the same time to domestic as well as to public affairs; and others, who are engaged with business, can still form a sufficient judgment on political questions.

2.40.2
1218
 μόνοι γὰρ τόν τε μηδὲν τῶνδε μετέχοντα οὐκ ἀπράγμονα , ἀλλ’ ἀχρεῖον νομίζομεν , καὶ οἱ αὐτοὶ ἤτοι κρίνομέν γε ἢ ἐνθυμούμεθα ὀρθῶς τὰ πράγματα , οὐ τοὺς λόγους τοῖς ἔργοις βλάβην ἡγούμενοι , ἀλλὰ μὴ προδιδαχθῆναι μᾶλλον λόγῳ πρότερον ἢ ἐπὶ ἃ δεῖ ἔργῳ ἐλθεῖν .
For we are the only people that consider the man who takes no part in these things, not as unofficious but as useless; and we ourselves judge rightly of measures, at any rate, if we do not originate them; while we do not regard words as any hinderance to deeds, but rather [consider it a hinderance] not to have been previously instructed by word, before undertaking in deed what we have to do.

2.40.3
1219
 διαφερόντως γὰρ δὴ καὶ τόδε ἔχομεν ὥστε τολμᾶν τε οἱ αὐτοὶ μάλιστα καὶ περὶ ὧν ἐπιχειρήσομεν ἐκλογίζεσθαι ·
For we have this characteristic also in a remarkable degree, that we are at the same time most daring and most calculating in what we take in hand;

2.40.3
1220
 ὃ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀμαθία μὲν θράσος , λογισμὸς δὲ ὄκνον φέρει .
whereas to other men it is ignorance that brings daring, while calculation brings fear.

2.40.3
1221
 κράτιστοι δ’ ἂν τὴν ψυχὴν δικαίως κριθεῖεν οἱ τά τε δεινὰ καὶ ἡδέα σαφέστατα γιγνώσκοντες καὶ διὰ ταῦτα μὴ ἀποτρεπόμενοι ἐκ τῶν κινδύνων .
Those, however, would deservedly be deemed most courageous, who know most fully what is terrible and what is pleasant, and yet do not on this account shrink from dangers.

2.40.4
1222
 καὶ τὰ ἐς ἀρετὴν ἐνηντιώμεθα τοῖς πολλοῖς ·
As regards beneficence also we differ from the generality of men;

2.40.4
1223
 οὐ γὰρ πάσχοντες εὖ , ἀλλὰ δρῶντες κτώμεθα τοὺς φίλους .
for we make friends, not by receiving, but by conferring kindness.

2.40.4
1224
 βεβαιότερος δὲ ὁ δράσας τὴν χάριν ὥστε ὀφειλομένην δι’ εὐνοίας ᾧ δέδωκε σῴζειν ·
Now he who has conferred the favour is the firmer friend, in order that he may keep alive the obligation by good will towards the man on whom he has conferred it;

2.40.4
1225
 ὁ δὲ ἀντοφείλων ἀμβλύτερος , εἰδὼς οὐκ ἐς χάριν , ἀλλ’ ἐς ὀφείλημα τὴν ἀρετὴν ἀποδώσων .
whereas he who owes it in return feels less keenly, knowing that it is not as a favour, but as a debt, that he will repay the kindness.

2.40.5
1226
 καὶ μόνοι οὐ τοῦ ξυμφέροντος μᾶλλον λογισμῷ ἢ τῆς ἐλευθερίας τῷ πιστῷ ἀδεῶς τινὰ ὠφελοῦμεν .
Nay, we are the only men who fearlessly benefit any one, not so much from calculations of expediency, as with the confidence of liberality.

2.41.1
1227
 &quot; ξυνελών τε λέγω τήν τε πᾶσαν πόλιν τῆς Ἑλλάδος παίδευσιν εἶναι καὶ καθ’ ἕκαστον δοκεῖν ἄν μοι τὸν αὐτὸν ἄνδρα παρ’ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ πλεῖστ’ ἂν εἴδη καὶ μετὰ χαρίτων μάλιστ’ ἂν εὐτραπέλως τὸ σῶμα αὔταρκες παρέχεσθαι .
"In short, I say that both the whole city is a school for Greece, and that, in my opinion, the same individual would amongst us prove himself qualified for the most varied kinds of action, and with the most graceful

2.41.2
1228
 καὶ ὡς οὐ λόγων ἐν τῷ παρόντι κόμπος τάδε μᾶλλον ἢ ἔργων ἐστὶν ἀλήθεια , αὐτὴ ἡ δύναμις τῆς πόλεως , ἣν ἀπὸ τῶνδε τῶν τρόπων ἐκτησάμεθα , σημαίνει .
versatility. And that this is not mere vaunting language for the occasion, so much as actual truth, the. very power of the state, which we have won by such habits, affords a proof. For it is the only country at the present time that, when brought to the test, proves superior to its

2.41.3
1229
 μόνη γὰρ τῶν νῦν ἀκοῆς κρείσσων ἐς πεῖραν ἔρχεται , καὶ μόνη οὔτε τῷ πολεμίῳ ἐπελθόντι ἀγανάκτησιν ἔχει ὑφ’ οἵων κακοπαθεῖ οὔτε τῷ ὑπηκόῳ κατάμεμψιν ὡς οὐχ ὑπ’ ἀξίων ἄρχεται .
fame; and the only one that neither gives to the enemy who has attacked us any cause for indignation at being worsted by such opponents, nor to him who is subject to us room for finding fault, as not being ruled by men who are worthy of

2.41.4
1230
 μετὰ μεγάλων δὲ σημείων καὶ οὐ δή τοι ἀμάρτυρόν γε τὴν δύναμιν παρασχόμενοι τοῖς τε νῦν καὶ τοῖς ἔπειτα θαυμασθησόμεθα , καὶ οὐδὲν προσδεόμενοι οὔτε Ὁμήρου ἐπαινέτου οὔτε ὅστις ἔπεσι μὲν τὸ αὐτίκα τέρψει , τῶν δ’ ἔργων τὴν ὑπόνοιαν ἡ ἀλήθεια βλάψει , ἀλλὰ πᾶσαν μὲν θάλασσαν καὶ γῆν ἐσβατὸν τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ τόλμῃ καταναγκάσαντες γενέσθαι , πανταχοῦ δὲ μνημεῖα κακῶν τε κ- ἀγαθῶν ἀίδια ξυγκατοικίσαντες .
empire. But we shall be admired both by present and future generations as having excited our power with great proofs, and by no means without evident and as having no further need, either of Homer to praise us, or any one else who might charm for the moment by his verses, while the truth of the facts would mar the idea formed of them; but as having compelled every sea and land to come accessible to our daring, and every where established everlasting records, whether of evil or of

2.41.5
1231
 περὶ τοιαύτης οὖν πόλεως οἵδε τε γενναίως δικαιοῦντες μὴ ἀφαιρεθῆναι αὐτὴν μαχόμενοι ἐτελεύτησαν , καὶ τῶν λειπομένων πάντα τινὰ εἰκὸς ἐθέλειν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς κάμνειν .
good. It was for such a country then at these men, nobly resolving not to have it taken from them, fell fighting; and every one of their survivors may well be willing to suffer in its behalf.

2.42.1
1232
 &quot; δι’ ὃ δὴ καὶ ἐμήκυνα τὰ περὶ τῆς πόλεως , διδασκαλίαν τε ποιούμενος μὴ περὶ ἴσου ἡμῖν εἶναι τὸν ἀγῶνα καὶ οἷς τῶνδε μηδὲν ὑπάρχει ὁμοίως , καὶ τὴν εὐλογίαν ἅμα ἐφ’ οἷς νῦν λέγω φανερὰν σημείοις καθιστάς .
"For this reason, indeed, it is that I have enlarged on the characteristics of the state; both to prove that the struggle is not for the same object in our case as in that of men who have none of these advantages in an equal degree; and at the same time clearly to establish by proofs [the truth of] the eulogy of those men over whom I am now speaking.

2.42.2
1233
 καὶ εἴρηται αὐτῆς τὰ μέγιστα ·
And now the chief points of it have been mentioned;

2.42.2
1234
 ἃ γὰρ τὴν πόλιν ὕμνησα , αἱ τῶνδε καὶ τῶν τοιῶνδε ἀρεταὶ ἐκόσμησαν , καὶ οὐκ ἂν πολλοῖς τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἰσόρροπος ὥσπερ τῶνδε ὁ λόγος τῶν ἔργων φανείη .
for with regard to the things for which I have commended the city, it was the virtues of these men, and such as these, that adorned her with them; and few of the Greeks are there whose fame, like these men's, would appear but the just counterpoise of their deeds.

2.42.2
1235
 δοκεῖ δέ μοι δηλοῦν ἀνδρὸς ἀρετὴν πρώτη τε μηνύουσα καὶ τελευταία βεβαιοῦσα ἡ νῦν τῶνδε καταστροφή .
Again, the closing scene of these men appears to me to supply an illustration of human worth, whether as affording us the first information respecting it, or its final confirmation.

2.42.3
1236
 καὶ γὰρ τοῖς τ- ἄλλα χείροσι δίκαιον τὴν ἐς τοὺς πολέμους ὑπὲρ τῆς πατρίδος ἀνδραγαθίαν προτίθεσθαι ·
For even in the case of men who have been in other respects of an inferior character, it is but fair for them to hold forth as a screen their military courage in their country's behalf;

2.42.3
1237
 ἀγαθῷ γὰρ κακὸν ἀφανίσαντες κοινῶς μᾶλλον ὠφέλησαν ἢ ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων ἔβλαψαν .
for, having wiped out their evil by their good, they did more service collectively, than harm by their individual offences.

2.42.4
1238
 τῶνδε δὲ οὔτε πλούτου τις τὴν ἔτι ἀπόλαυσιν προτιμήσας ἐμαλακίσθη οὔτε πενίας ἐλπίδι , ὡς κἂν ἔτι διαφυγὼν αὐτὴν πλουτήσειεν , ἀναβολὴν τοῦ δεινοῦ ἐποιήσατο ·
But of these men there was none that either was made a coward by his wealth, from preferring the continued enjoyment of it;

2.42.4
1239
 τὴν δὲ τῶν ἐναντίων τιμωρίαν ποθεινοτέραν αὐτῶν λαβόντες καὶ κινδύνων ἅμα τόνδε κάλλιστον νομίσαντες ἐβουλήθησαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ τοὺς μὲν τιμωρεῖσθαι , τῶν δὲ ἐφίεσθαι , ἐλπίδι μὲν τὸ ἀφανὲς τοῦ κατορθώσειν ἐπιτρέψαντες , ἔργῳ δὲ περὶ τοῦ ἤδη ὁρωμένου σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἀξιοῦντες πεποιθέναι , καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ ἀμύνεσθαι καὶ παθεῖν μᾶλλον ἡγησάμενοι ἢ τὸ ἐνδόντες σῴζεσθαι , τὸ μὲν αἰσχρὸν τοῦ λόγου ἔφυγον , τὸ δ’ ἔργον τῷ σώματι ὑπέμειναν καὶ δι’ ἐλαχίστου καιροῦ τύχης ἅμα ἀκμῇ τῆς δόξης μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦ δέους ἀπηλλάγησαν .
or shrank from danger through a hope suggested by poverty, namely, that he might yet escape it, and grow richly; but conceiving that vengeance on their foes was more to be desired than these objects, and at the same time regarding this as the most glorious of hazards, they wished by risking it to be avenged on their enemies, and so to aim at procuring those advantages; committing to hope the uncertainty of success, but resolving to trust to action, with regard to what was visible to themselves; and in that action, being minded rather to resist and die, than by surrendering to escape, they fled from the shame of [a discreditable] report, while they endured the brunt of the battle with their bodies; and after the shortest crisis, when at the very height of their fortune, were taken away from their glory rather than their fear.

2.43.1
1240
 &quot; καὶ οἵδε μὲν προσηκόντως τῇ πόλει τοιοίδε ἐγένοντο ·
Such did these men prove themselves, as became the character of their country.

2.43.1
1241
 τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς χρὴ ἀσφαλεστέραν μὲν εὔχεσθαι , ἀτολμοτέραν δὲ μηδὲν ἀξιοῦν τὴν ἐς τοὺς πολεμίους διάνοιαν ἔχειν , σκοποῦντας μὴ λόγῳ μόνῳ τὴν ὠφελίαν , ἣν ἄν τις πρὸς οὐδὲν χεῖρον αὐτοὺς ὑμᾶς εἰδότας μηκύνοι , λέγων ὅσα ἐν τῷ τοὺς πολεμίους ἀμύνεσθαι ἀγαθὰ ἔνεστιν , ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον τὴν τῆς πόλεως δύναμιν καθ’ ἡμέραν ἔργῳ θεωμένους καὶ ἐραστὰς γιγνομένους αὐτῆς , καὶ ὅταν ὑμῖν μεγάλη δόξῃ εἶναι ,ἐνθυμουμένους ὅτι τολμῶντες καὶ γιγνώσκοντες τὰ δέοντα καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις αἰσχυνόμενοι ἄνδρες αὐτὰ ἐκτήσαντο , καὶ ὁπότε καὶ πείρᾳ του σφαλεῖεν , οὐκ οὖν καὶ τὴν πόλιν γε τῆς σφετέρας ἀρετῆς ἀξιοῦντες στερίσκειν , κάλλιστον δὲ ἔρανον αὐτῇ προϊέμενοι .
For you that remain, you must pray that you may have a more successful resolution, but must determine not to have one less bold against your enemies; not in word alone considering the benefit [of such a spirit], (on which one might descant to you at great length—though you know it yourselves quite as well—telling you how many advantages are contained in repelling your foes;) but rather day by day beholding the power of the city as it appears in fact, and growing enamoured of it, and reflecting, when you think it great, that it was by being bold, and knowing their duty, and being alive to shame in action, that men acquired these things; and because, if they ever failed in their attempt at any thing, they did not on that account think it right to deprive their country also of their valour, but conferred upon her a most glorious joint-offering.

2.43.2
1242
 κοινῇ γὰρ τὰ σώματα διδόντες ἰδίᾳ τὸν ἀγήρων ἔπαινον ἐλάμβανον καὶ τὸν τάφον ἐπισημότατον , οὐκ ἐν ᾧ κεῖνται μᾶλλον , ἀλλ’ ἐν ᾧ ἡ δόξα αὐτῶν παρὰ τῷ ἐντυχόντι αἰεὶ καὶ λόγου καὶ ἔργου καιρῷ αἰείμνηστος καταλείπεται .
For while collectively they gave her their lives, individually they received that renown which never grows old, and the most distinguished tomb they could have; not so much that in which they are laid, as that in which their glory is left behind them, to be everlastingly recorded on every occasion for doing so, either by word or deed, that may from time to time present itself.

2.43.3
1243
 ἀνδρῶν γὰρ ἐπιφανῶν πᾶσα γῆ τάφος , καὶ οὐ στηλῶν μόνον ἐν τῇ οἰκείᾳ σημαίνει ἐπιγραφή , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τῇ μὴ προσηκούσῃ ἄγραφος μνήμη παρ’ ἑκάστῳ τῆς γνώμης μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦ ἔργου ἐνδιαιτᾶται .
For of illustrious men the whole earth is the sepulchre; and not only does the inscription upon. columns their own land point it out, but in that also which is not their own there dwells with every one an unwritten memorial of the heart, rather than of a material monument.

2.43.4
1244
 οὓς νῦν ὑμεῖς ζηλώσαντες καὶ τὸ εὔδαιμον τὸ ἐλεύθερον , τὸ δ’ ἐλεύθερον τὸ εὔψυχον κρίναντες μὴ περιορᾶσθε τοὺς πολεμικοὺς κινδύνους .
Vieing then with these men in your turn, and deeming happiness to consist in freedom, and freedom in valour, do not think lightly of the hazards of war.

2.43.5
1245
 οὐ γὰρ οἱ κακοπραγοῦντες δικαιότερον ἀφειδοῖεν ἂν τοῦ βίου , οἷς ἐλπὶς οὐκ ἔστιν ἀγαθοῦ , ἀλλ’ οἷς ἡ ἐναντία μεταβολὴ ἐν τῷ ζῆν ἔτι κινδυνεύεται καὶ ἐν οἷς μάλιστα μεγάλα τὰ διαφέροντα , ἤν τι πταίσωσιν .
For it is not the unfortunate, [and those] who have no hope of any good, that would with most reason be unsparing of their lives; but those who, while they live, still incur the risk of a change to the opposite condition, and to whom the difference would be the greatest, should they meet with any reverse.

2.43.6
1246
 ἀλγεινοτέρα γὰρ ἀνδρί γε φρόνημα ἔχοντι ἡ μετὰ τοῦ ἐν τῷ μαλακισθῆναι κάκωσις ἢ ὁ μετὰ ῥώμης καὶ κοινῆς ἐλπίδος ἅμα γιγνόμενος ἀναίσθητος θάνατος .
For more grievous, to a man of high spirit at least, is the misery which accompanies cowardice, than the unfelt death which comes upon him at once, in the time of his strength and of his hope for the common welfare.

2.44.1
1247
 &quot; δι’ ὅπερ καὶ τοὺς τῶνδε νῦν τοκέας , ὅσοι πάρεστε , οὐκ ὀλοφύρομαι μᾶλλον ἢ παραμυθήσομαι .
Wherefore to the parents of the dead—as many of them as are here among you—I will not offer condolence, so much as consolation.

2.44.1
1248
 ἐν πολυτρόποις γὰρ ξυμφοραῖς ἐπίστανται τραφέντες ·
For they know that they have been brought up subject to manifold misfortunes;

2.44.1
1249
 τὸ δ’ εὐτυχές , οἳ ἂν τῆς εὐπρεπεστάτης λάχωσιν , ὥσπερ οἵδε μὲν νῦν , τελευτῆς , ὑμεῖς δὲ λύπης , καὶ οἷς ἐνευδαιμονῆσαί τε ὁ βίος ὁμοίως καὶ ἐντελευτῆσαι ξυνεμετρήθη .
but that happy is their lot who have gained the most glorious—death, as these have,—sorrow, as you have; and to whom life has been so exactly measured, that they were both happy in it, and died in [that happiness].

2.44.2
1250
 χαλεπὸν μὲν οὖν οἶδα πείθειν ὄν , ὧν καὶ πολλάκις ἕξετε ὑπομνήματα ἐν ἄλλων εὐτυχίαις , αἷς ποτὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἠγάλλεσθε ·
Difficult, indeed, I know it is to persuade you of this, with regard to those of whom you will often be reminded by the good fortune of others, in which you yourselves also once rejoiced;

2.44.2
1251
 καὶ λύπη οὐχ ὧν ἄν τις μὴ πειρασάμενος ἀγαθῶν στερίσκηται , ἀλλ’ οὗ ἂν ἐθὰς γενόμενος ἀφαιρεθῇ .
and sorrow is felt, not for the blessings of which one is bereft without full experience of them, but of that which one loses after becoming accustomed to it.

2.44.3
1252
 καρτερεῖν δὲ χρὴ καὶ ἄλλων παίδων ἐλπίδι ,οἷς ἔτι ἡλικία τέκνωσιν ποιεῖσθαι ·
But you must bear up in the hope of other children, those of you whose age yet allows you to have them.

2.44.3
1253
 ἰδίᾳ τε γὰρ τῶν οὐκ ὄντων λήθη οἱ ἐπιγιγνόμενοί τισιν ἔσονται , καὶ τῇ πόλει διχόθεν , ἔκ τε τοῦ μὴ ἐρημοῦσθαι καὶ ἀσφαλείᾳ , ξυνοίσει ·
For to yourselves individually those who are subsequently born will be a reason for your forgetting those who are no more; and to the state it will be beneficial in two ways, by its not being depopulated, and by the enjoyment of security;

2.44.3
1254
 οὐ γὰρ οἷόν τε ἴσον τι ἢ δίκαιον βουλεύεσθαι οἳ ἂν μὴ καὶ παῖδας ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου παραβαλλόμενοι κινδυνεύωσιν .
for it is not possible that those should offer any fair and just advice, who do not incur equal risk with their neighbours by having children at stake.

2.44.4
1255
 ὅσοι δ’ αὖ παρηβήκατε , τόν τε πλέονα κέρδος ὃν ηὐτυχεῖτε βίον ἡγεῖσθε καὶ τόνδε βραχὺν ἔσεσθαι , καὶ τῇ τῶνδε εὐκλείᾳ κουφίζεσθε .
Those of you, however, who are past that age, must consider that the longer period of your life during which you have been prosperous is so much gain, and that what remains will be but a short one; and you must cheer yourselves with the fair fame of these [your lost ones].

2.44.4
1256
 τὸ γὰρ φιλότιμον ἀγήρων μόνον , καὶ οὐκ ἐν τῷ ἀχρείῳ τῆς ἡλικίας τὸ κερδαίνειν , ὥσπερ τινές φασι , μᾶλλον τέρπει , ἀλλὰ τὸ τιμᾶσθαι .
For the love of honour is the only feeling that never grows old; and in the helplessness of age it is not the acquisition of gain, as some assert, that gives greatest pleasure, but the enjoyment of honour.

2.45.1
1257
 παισὶ δ’ αὖ ὅσοι τῶνδε πάρεστε ἢ ἀδελφοῖς ὁρῶ μέγαν τὸν ἀγῶνα ( τὸν γὰρ οὐκ ὄντα ἅπας εἴωθεν ἐπαινεῖν ) , καὶ μόλις ἂν καθ’ ὑπερβολὴν ἀρετῆς οὐχ ὁμοῖοι , ἀλλ’ ὀλίγῳ χείρους κριθεῖτε .
For those of you, on the other hand, who are sons or brothers of the dead, great, I see, will be the struggle of competition. For every one is accustomed to praise the man who is no more; and scarcely, though even for an excess of worth, would you be esteemed, I do not say equal to them, but only slightly inferior.

2.45.1
1258
 φθόνος γὰρ τοῖς ζῶσι πρὸς τὸ ἀντίπαλον , τὸ δὲ μὴ ἐμποδὼν ἀνανταγωνίστῳ εὐνοίᾳ τετίμηται .
For the living are exposed to envy in their rivalry; but those who are in no one's way are honoured with a good will free from all opposition.

2.45.2
1259
 εἰ δέ με δεῖ καὶ γυναικείας τι ἀρετῆς , ὅσαι νῦν ἐν χηρείᾳ ἔσονται , μνησθῆναι , βραχείᾳ παραινέσει ἅπαν σημανῶ .
If, again, I must say anything on the subject of woman's excellence also, with reference to those of you who will now be in widowhood, I will express it all in a brief exhortation.

2.45.2
1260
 τῆς τε γὰρ ὑπαρχούσης φύσεως μὴ χείροσι γενέσθαι ὑμῖν μεγάλη ἡ δόξα καὶ ἧς ἂν ἐπ’ ἐλάχιστον ἀρετῆς πέρι ἢ ψόγου ἐν τοῖς ἄρσεσι κλέος ᾖ .
Great will be your glory in not tailing short of the natural character that belongs to you; and great is hers, who is least talked of amongst the men, either for good or evil.

2.46.1
1261
 &quot; εἴρηται καὶ ἐμοὶ λόγῳ κατὰ τὸν νόμον ὅσα εἶχον πρόσφορα , καὶ ἔργῳ οἱ θαπτόμενοι τὰ μὲν ἤδη κεκόσμηνται , τὰ δὲ αὐτῶν τοὺς παῖδας τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε δημοσίᾳ ἡ πόλις μέχρι ἥβης θρέψει , ὠφέλιμον στέφανον τοῖσδέ τε καὶ τοῖς λειπομένοις τῶν τοιῶνδε ἀγώνων προτιθεῖσα ·
I have now expressed as the law required, what I had to say befitting the occasion; and those who are here interred have already received part of their honours; while, for the remaining part, the state will bring up their sons at the public expense, from this time to their manhood; thus offering both to these and to their posterity a beneficial reward for such contests;

2.46.1
1262
 ἆθλα γὰρ οἷς κεῖται ἀρετῆς μέγιστα , τοῖς δὲ καὶ ἄνδρες ἄριστοι πολιτεύουσιν .
For where the greatest prizes for virtue are given, there also the most virtuous men are found amongst the citizens.

2.46.2
1263
 νῦν δὲ ἀπολοφυράμενοι ὃν προσήκει ἑκάστῳ ἄπιτε &quot; .
" And now, having finished your lamentations for your several relatives, depart."

2.47.1
1264
 τοιόσδε μὲν ὁ τάφος ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ ·
Such was the funeral that took place this winter,

2.47.1
1265
 καὶ διελθόντος αὐτοῦ πρῶτον ἔτος τοῦ πολέμου τοῦδε ἐτελεύτα .
at the close of which the first year of this war ended.

2.47.2
1266
 τοῦ δὲ θέρους εὐθὺς ἀρχομένου Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι τὰ δύο μέρη ὥσπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἐσέβαλον ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν ( ἡγεῖτο δὲ Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ Ζευξιδάμου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς ) , καὶ καθεζόμενοι ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν .
At the very beginning of the next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies, with two thirds of their forces, as on the first occasion, invaded Attica, under the command of Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians; and after encamping, they laid waste the country.

2.47.3
1267
 καὶ ὄντων αὐτῶν οὐ πολλάς πω ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ἡ νόσος πρῶτον ἤρξατο γενέσθαι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , λεγόμενον μὲν καὶ πρότερον πολλαχόσε ἐγκατασκῆψαι καὶ περὶ Λῆμνον καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις χωρίοις , οὐ μέντοι τοσοῦτός γε λοιμὸς οὐδὲ φθορὰ οὕτως ἀνθρώπων οὐδαμοῦ ἐμνημονεύετο γενέσθαι .
When they had not yet been many days in Attica, the plague first began to show itself amongst the Athenians; though it was said to have previously lighted on many places, about Lemnos and elsewhere. Such a pestilence, however, and loss of life as this was no where remembered to have happened.

2.47.4
1268
 οὔτε γὰρ ἰατροὶ ἤρκουν τὸ πρῶτον θεραπεύοντες ἀγνοίᾳ , ἀλλ’ αὐτοὶ μάλιστα ἔθνῃσκον ὅσῳ καὶ μάλιστα προσῇσαν , οὔτε ἄλλη ἀνθρωπεία τέχνη οὐδεμία ·
For neither were physicians of any avail at first, treating it as they did, in ignorance of its nature,—nay, they themselves died most of all, inasmuch as they most visited the sick,—nor any other art of man.

2.47.4
1269
 ὅσα τε πρὸς ἱεροῖς ἱκέτευσαν ἢ μαντείοις καὶ τοῖς τοιούτοις ἐχρήσαντο , πάντα ἀνωφελῆ ἦν , τελευτῶντές τε αὐτῶν ἀπέστησαν ὑπὸ τοῦ κακοῦ νικώμενοι .
And as to the supplications that they offered in their temples, or the divinations, and similar means, that they had recourse to, they were all unavailing; and at last they ceased from them, being overcome by the pressure of the calamity.

2.48.1
1270
 ἤρξατο δὲ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον , ὡς λέγεται , ἐξ Αἰθιοπίας τῆς ὑπὲρ Αἰγύπτου , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ ἐς Αἴγυπτον καὶ Λιβύην κατέβη καὶ ἐς τὴν βασιλέως γῆν τὴν πολλήν .
It is said to have first begun in the part of Aethiopia above Egypt, and then to have come down into Egypt, and Libya, and the greatest part of the king's territory.

2.48.2
1271
 ἐς δὲ τὴν Ἀθηναίων πόλιν ἐξαπιναίως ἐσέπεσε , καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἐν τῷ Πειραιεῖ ἥψατο τῶν ἀνθρώπων , ὥστε καὶ ἐλέχθη ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ὡς οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι φάρμακα ἐσβεβλήκοιεν ἐς τὰ φρέατα ·
On the city of Athens it fell suddenly, and first attacked the men in the Piraeus; so that it was even reported by them that the Peloponnesians had thrown poison into the cisterns;

2.48.2
1272
 κρῆναι γὰρ οὔπω ἦσαν αὐτόθι .
for as yet there were no fountains there.

2.48.2
1273
 ὕστερον δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν ἄνω πόλιν ἀφίκετο , καὶ ἔθνῃσκον πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἤδη .
Afterwards it reached the upper city also; and then they died much more generally.

2.48.3
1274
 λεγέτω μὲν οὖν περὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς ἕκαστος γιγνώσκει καὶ ἰατρὸς καὶ ἰδιώτης , ἀφ’ ὅτου εἰκὸς ἦν γενέσθαι αὐτό , καὶ τὰς αἰτίας ἅστινας νομίζει τοσαύτης μεταβολῆς ἱκανὰς εἶναι δύναμιν ἐς τὸ μεταστῆσαι σχεῖν ·
Now let every one, whether physician or unprofessional man, speak on the subject according to his views; from what source it was likely to have arisen, and the causes which he thinks were sufficient to have produced so great a change.

2.48.3
1275
 ἐγὼ δὲ οἷόν τε ἐγίγνετο λέξω , καὶ ἀφ’ ὧν ἄν τις σκοπῶν , εἴ ποτε καὶ αὖθις ἐπιπέσοι , μάλιστ’ ἂν ἔχοι τι προειδὼς μὴ ἀγνοεῖν , ταῦτα δηλώσω αὐτός τε νοσήσας καὶ αὐτὸς ἰδὼν ἄλλους πάσχοντας .
I, however, shall only describe what was its character; and explain those symptoms by reference to which one might best be enabled to recognise it through this previous acquaintance, if it should ever break out again; for I was both attacked by it myself, and had personal observation of others who were suffering with it.

2.49.1
1276
 τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἔτος , ὡς ὡμολογεῖτο , ἐκ πάντων μάλιστα δὴ ἐκεῖνο ἄνοσον ἐς τὰς ἄλλας ἀσθενείας ἐτύγχανεν ὄν ·
That year then, as was generally allowed, happened to be of all years the most free from disease, so far as regards other disorders;

2.49.1
1277
 εἰ δέ τις καὶ προύκαμνέ τι , ἐς τοῦτο πάντα ἀπεκρίθη .
and if any one had any previous sickness, all terminated in this.

2.49.2
1278
 τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ἀπ’ οὐδεμιᾶς προφάσεως , ἀλλ’ ἐξαίφνης ὑγιεῖς ὄντας πρῶτον μὲν τῆς κεφαλῆς θέρμαι ἰσχυραὶ καὶ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἐρυθήματα καὶ φλόγωσις ἐλάμβανε , καὶ τὰ ἐντός , ἥ τε φάρυγξ καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα , εὐθὺς αἱματώδη ἦν καὶ πνεῦμα ἄτοπον καὶ δυσῶδες ἠφίει ·
Others, without any ostensible cause, but suddenly, while in the enjoyment of health, were seized at first with violent heats in the head, and redness and inflammation of the eyes; and the internal parts, both the throat and the tongue, immediately assumed a bloody tinge, and emitted an unnatural and fetid breath.

2.49.3
1279
 ἔπειτα ἐξ αὐτῶν πταρμὸς καὶ βράγχος ἐπεγίγνετο , καὶ ἐν οὐ πολλῷ χρόνῳ κατέβαινεν ἐς τὰ στήθη ὁ πόνος μετὰ βηχὸς ἰσχυροῦ ·
Next after these symptoms sneezing and hoarseness came on; and in a short time the pain descended to the chest, with a violent cough.

2.49.3
1280
 καὶ ὁπότε ἐς τὴν καρδίαν στηρίξειεν , ἀνέστρεφέ τε αὐτὴν καὶ ἀποκαθάρσεις χολῆς πᾶσαι ὅσαι ὑπὸ ἰατρῶν ὠνομασμέναι εἰσὶν ἐπῇσαν , καὶ αὗται μετὰ ταλαιπωρίας μεγάλης .
When it settled in the stomach, it caused vomiting and all the discharges of bile that have been mentioned by physicians succeeded, and those accompanied with great suffering.

2.49.4
1281
 λύγξ τε τοῖς πλέοσιν ἐνέπιπτε κενή , σπασμὸν ἐνδιδοῦσα ἰσχυρόν , τοῖς μὲν μετὰ ταῦτα λωφήσαντα , τοῖς δὲ καὶ πολλῷ ὕστερον .
An ineffectual retching also followed in most cases, producing a violent spasm, which in some cases ceased soon afterwards, in others much later. Externally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor was it pale;

2.49.5
1282
 καὶ τὸ μὲν ἔξωθεν ἁπτομένῳ σῶμα οὔτ’ ἄγαν θερμὸν ἦν οὔτε χλωρόν , ἀλλ’ ὑπέρυθρον , πελιτνόν , φλυκταίναις μικραῖς καὶ ἕλκεσιν ἐξηνθηκός ·
but reddish, livid, and broken out in small pimples and sores.

2.49.5
1283
 τὰ δὲ ἐντὸς οὕτως ἐκάετο ὥστε μήτε τῶν πάνυ λεπτῶν ἱματίων καὶ σινδόνων τὰς ἐπιβολὰς μηδ’ ἄλλο τι ἢ γυμνοὶ ἀνέχεσθαι , ἥδιστά τε ἂν ἐς ὕδωρ ψυχρὸν σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ῥίπτειν .
But the internal parts were burnt to such a degree that they could not bear clothing or linen of the very lightest kind to be laid upon them, nor to be any thing else but stark naked; but would most gladly have thrown themselves into cold water if they could.

2.49.5
1284
 καὶ πολλοὶ τοῦτο τῶν ἠμελημένων ἀνθρώπων καὶ ἔδρασαν ἐς φρέατα , τῇ δίψῃ ἀπαύστῳ ξυνεχόμενοι ·
Indeed many of those who were not taken care of did so, plunging into cisterns in the agony of their unquenchable thirst;

2.49.5
1285
 καὶ ἐν τῷ ὁμοίῳ καθειστήκει τό τε πλέον καὶ ἔλασσον ποτόν .
and it was all the same whether they drank much or little.

2.49.6
1286
 καὶ ἡ ἀπορία τοῦ μὴ ἡσυχάζειν καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία ἐπέκειτο διὰ παντός .
Moreover, the misery of restlessness and wakefulness continually oppressed them:

2.49.6
1287
 καὶ τὸ σῶμα , ὅσονπερ χρόνον καὶ ἡ νόσος ἀκμάζοι , οὐκ ἐμαραίνετο , ἀλλ’ ἀντεῖχε παρὰ δόξαν τῇ ταλαιπωρίᾳ , ὥστε ἢ διεφθείροντο οἱ πλεῖστοι ἐναταῖοι καὶ ἑβδομαῖοι ὑπὸ τοῦ ἐντὸς καύματος , ἔτι ἔχοντές τι δυνάμεως , ἢ εἰ διαφύγοιεν , ἐπικατιόντος τοῦ νοσήματος ἐς τὴν κοιλίαν καὶ ἑλκώσεώς τε αὐτῇ ἰσχυρᾶς ἐγγιγνομένης καὶ διαρροίας ἅμα ἀκράτου ἐπιπιπτούσης οἱ πολλοὶ ὕστερον δι’ αὐτὴν ἀσθενείᾳ διεφθείροντο .
The body did not waste away so long as the disease was at its height, but resisted it beyond all expectation: so that they either died in most cases on the ninth or the seventh day, through the internal burning, while they had still some degree of strength; or if they escaped [that stage of the disorder], then, after it had further descended into the bowels, and violent ulceration was produced in them, and intense diarrhoea had come on, the greater part were afterwards carried off through the weakness occasioned by it.

2.49.7
1288
 διεξῄει γὰρ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ σώματος ἄνωθεν ἀρξάμενον τὸ ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ πρῶτον ἱδρυθὲν κακόν , καὶ εἴ τις ἐκ τῶν μεγίστων περιγένοιτο , τῶν γε ἀκρωτηρίων ἀντίληψις αὐτοῦ ἐπεσήμαινεν .
For the disease, which was originally seated in the head, beginning from above, passed throughout the whole body; and if any one survived its most fatal consequences, yet it marked him by laying hold of his extremities;

2.49.8
1289
 κατέσκηπτε γὰρ ἐς αἰδοῖα καὶ ἐς ἄκρας χεῖρας καὶ πόδας , καὶ πολλοὶ στερισκόμενοι τούτων διέφευγον , εἰσὶ δ’ οἳ καὶ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν .
for it settled on the pudenda and fingers, and toes, and many escaped with the loss of these, while some also lost their eyes.

2.49.8
1290
 τοὺς δὲ καὶ λήθη ἐλάμβανε παραυτίκα ἀναστάντας τῶν πάντων ὁμοίως , καὶ ἠγνόησαν σφᾶς τε αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἐπιτηδείους .
Others, again, were seized on their first recovery with forgetfulness of every thing alike, and did not know either themselves or their friends.

2.50.1
1291
 γενόμενον γὰρ κρεῖσσον λόγου τὸ εἶδος τῆς νόσου τά τε ἄλλα χαλεπωτέρως ἢ κατὰ τὴν ἀνθρωπείαν φύσιν προσέπιπτεν ἑκάστῳ καὶ ἐν τῷδε ἐδήλωσε μάλιστα ἄλλο τι ὂν ἢ τῶν ξυντρόφων τι ·
For the character of the disorder surpassed description; and while in other respects also it attacked every one in a degree more grievous than human nature could endure,

2.50.1
1292
 τὰ γὰρ ὄρνεα καὶ τετράποδα ὅσα ἀνθρώπων ἅπτεται , πολλῶν ἀτάφων γιγνομένων ἢ οὐ προσῄει ἢ γευσάμενα διεφθείρετο .
in the following way, especially, it proved itself to be something different from any of the diseases familiar to man. All the birds and beasts that prey on human bodies, either did not come near them, though there were many lying unburied, or died after they had tasted them.

2.50.2
1293
 τεκμήριον δέ ·
As a proof of this,

2.50.2
1294
 τῶν μὲν τοιούτων ὀρνίθων ἐπίλειψις σαφὴς ἐγένετο , καὶ οὐχ ἑωρῶντο οὔτε ἄλλως οὔτε περὶ τοιοῦτον οὐδέν ·
there was a marked disappearance of birds of this kind, and they were not seen either engaged in this way, or in any other;

2.50.2
1295
 οἱ δὲ κύνες μᾶλλον αἴσθησιν παρεῖχον τοῦ ἀποβαίνοντος διὰ τὸ ξυνδιαιτᾶσθαι .
while the dogs, from their domestic habits, more clearly afforded opportunity of marking the result I have mentioned.

2.51.1
1296
 τὸ μὲν οὖν νόσημα , πολλὰ καὶ ἄλλα παραλιπόντι ἀτοπίας , ὡς ἑκάστῳ ἐτύγχανέ τι διαφερόντως ἑτέρῳ πρὸς ἕτερον γιγνόμενον , τοιοῦτον ἦν ἐπὶ πᾶν τὴν ἰδέαν .
The disease, then, to pass over many various points of peculiarity, as it happened to be different in one case from another, was in its general nature such as I have described.

2.51.1
1297
 καὶ ἄλλο παρελύπει κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον οὐδὲν τῶν εἰωθότων ·
And no other of those to which they were accustomed afflicted them besides this at that time;

2.51.1
1298
 ὃ δὲ καὶ γένοιτο , ἐς τοῦτο ἐτελεύτα .
or whatever there was, it ended in this. And [of those who were seized by it] some died in neglect, others in the midst of every attention.

2.51.2
1299
 ἔθνῃσκον δὲ οἱ μὲν ἀμελείᾳ , οἱ δὲ καὶ πάνυ θεραπευόμενοι .
And [of those who were seized by it] some died in neglect, others in the midst of every attention.

2.51.2
1300
 ἕν τε οὐδὲ ἓν κατέστη ἴαμα ὡς εἰπεῖν ὅτι χρῆν προσφέροντας ὠφελεῖν ·
And there was no one settled remedy, so to speak, by applying which they were to give them relief;

2.51.2
1301
 τὸ γάρ τῳ ξυνενεγκὸν ἄλλον τοῦτο ἔβλαπτεν .
for what did good to one, did harm to another.

2.51.3
1302
 σῶμά τε αὔταρκες ὂν οὐδὲν διεφάνη πρὸς αὐτὸ ἰσχύος πέρι ἢ ἀσθενείας , ἀλλὰ πάντα ξυνῄρει καὶ τὰ πάσῃ διαίτῃ θεραπευόμενα .
And no constitution showed itself fortified against it, in point either of strength or weakness; but it seized on all alike, even those that were treated with all possible regard to diet.

2.51.4
1303
 δεινότατον δὲ παντὸς ἦν τοῦ κακοῦ ἥ τε ἀθυμία ὁπότε τις αἴσθοιτο κάμνων ( πρὸς γὰρ τὸ ἀνέλπιστον εὐθὺς τραπόμενοι τῇ γνώμῃ πολλῷ μᾶλλον προΐεντο σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐκ ἀντεῖχον ) , καὶ ὅτι ἕτερος ἀφ’ ἑτέρου θεραπείας ἀναπιμπλάμενοι ὥσπερ τὰ πρόβατα ἔθνῃσκον ·
But the most dreadful part of the whole calamity was the dejection felt whenever any one found himself sickening, (for by immediately falling into a feeling of despair, they abandoned themselves much more certainly to the disease, and did not resist it,) and the fact of their being charged with infection from attending on one another, and so dying like sheep.

2.51.4
1304
 καὶ τὸν πλεῖστον φθόρον τοῦτο ἐνεποίει .
And it was this that caused the greatest mortality amongst them;

2.51.5
1305
 εἴτε γὰρ μὴ ’θέλοιεν δεδιότες ἀλλήλοις προσιέναι , ἀπώλλυντο ἐρῆμοι , καὶ οἰκίαι πολλαὶ ἐκενώθησαν ἀπορίᾳ τοῦ θεραπεύσοντος ·
for if through fear they were unwilling to visit each other, they perished from being deserted, and many houses were emptied for want of some one to attend to the sufferers;

2.51.5
1306
 εἴτε προσίοιεν , διεφθείροντο , καὶ μάλιστα οἱ ἀρετῆς τι μεταποιούμενοι ·
or if they did visit them, they met their death, and especially such as made any pretensions to goodness;

2.51.5
1307
 αἰσχύνῃ γὰρ ἠφείδουν σφῶν αὐτῶν ἐσιόντες παρὰ τοὺς φίλους , ἐπεὶ καὶ τὰς ὀλοφύρσεις τῶν ἀπογιγνομένων τελευτῶντες καὶ οἱ οἰκεῖοι ἐξέκαμνον ὑπὸ τοῦ πολλοῦ κακοῦ νικώμενοι .
for through a feeling of shame they were unsparing of themselves, in going into their friends' houses [when deserted by all others]; since even the members of the family were at length worn out by the very moanings of the dying, and were overcome by their excessive misery.

2.51.6
1308
 ἐπὶ πλέον δ’ ὅμως οἱ διαπεφευγότες τόν τε θνῄσκοντα καὶ τὸν πονούμενον ᾠκτίζοντο διὰ τὸ προειδέναι τε καὶ αὐτοὶ ἤδη ἐν τῷ θαρσαλέῳ εἶναι ·
Still more, however, than even these, did such as had escaped the disorder show pity for the dying and the suffering, both from their previous knowledge of what it was, and from their being now in no fear of it themselves;

2.51.6
1309
 δὶς γὰρ τὸν αὐτόν , ὥστε καὶ κτείνειν , οὐκ ἐπελάμβανεν .
for it never seized the same person twice, so as to prove actually fatal.

2.51.6
1310
 καὶ ἐμακαρίζοντό τε ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλων , καὶ αὐτοὶ τῷ παραχρῆμα περιχαρεῖ καὶ ἐς τὸν ἔπειτα χρόνον ἐλπίδος τι εἶχον κούφης μηδ’ ἂν ὑπ’ ἄλλου νοσήματός ποτε ἔτι διαφθαρῆναι .
And such persons were felicitated by others; and themselves, in the excess of their present joy, entertained for the future also, to a certain degree, a vain hope that they would never now be carried off even by any other disease.

2.52.1
1311
 ἐπίεσε δ’ αὐτοὺς μᾶλλον πρὸς τῷ ὑπάρχοντι πόνῳ καὶ ἡ ξυγκομιδὴ ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἐς τὸ ἄστυ , καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον τοὺς ἐπελθόντας .
In addition to the original calamity, what oppressed them still more was the crowding into the city from the country, especially the new comers.

2.52.2
1312
 οἰκιῶν γὰρ οὐχ ὑπαρχουσῶν , ἀλλ’ ἐν καλύβαις πνιγηραῖς ὥρᾳ ἔτους διαιτωμένων ὁ φθόρος ἐγίγνετο οὐδενὶ κόσμῳ , ἀλλὰ καὶ νεκροὶ ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοις ἀποθνῄσκοντες ἔκειντο καὶ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς ἐκαλινδοῦντο καὶ περὶ τὰς κρήνας ἁπάσας ἡμιθνῆτες τοῦ ὕδατος ἐπιθυμίᾳ .
For as they had no houses, but lived in stifling cabins at the hot season of the year, the mortality amongst them spread without restraint; bodies lying on one another in the death-agony, and half-dead creatures rolling about in the streets and round all the fountains, in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which they had quartered themselves, were full of the corpses of those that died there in them:

2.52.3
1313
 τά τε ἱερὰ ἐν οἷς ἐσκήνηντο νεκρῶν πλέα ἦν , αὐτοῦ ἐναποθνῃσκόντων ·
for in the surpassing violence of the calamity, men not knowing what was to become of them, came to disregard everything, both sacred and profane, alike.

2.52.3
1314
 ὑπερβιαζομένου γὰρ τοῦ κακοῦ οἱ ἄνθρωποι , οὐκ ἔχοντες ὅτι γένωνται , ἐς ὀλιγωρίαν ἐτράποντο καὶ ἱερῶν καὶ ὁσίων ὁμοίως .
And all the laws were violated which they before observed respecting burials;

2.52.4
1315
 νόμοι τε πάντες ξυνεταράχθησαν οἷς ἐχρῶντο πρότερον περὶ τὰς ταφάς , ἔθαπτον δὲ ὡς ἕκαστος ἐδύνατο .
and they buried them as each one could. And many from want of proper means, in consequence of so many of their friends having already died, had recourse to shameless modes of sepulture;

2.52.4
1316
 καὶ πολλοὶ ἐς ἀναισχύντους θήκας ἐτράποντο σπάνει τῶν ἐπιτηδείων διὰ τὸ συχνοὺς ἤδη προτεθνάναι σφίσιν ·
for on the piles prepared for others, some, anticipating those who had raised them, would lay their own dead relative and set fire to them;

2.52.4
1317
 ἐπὶ πυρὰς γὰρ ἀλλοτρίας φθάσαντες τοὺς νήσαντας οἱ μὲν ἐπιθέντες τὸν ἑαυτῶν νεκρὸν ὑφῆπτον , οἱ δὲ καιομένου ἄλλου ἐπιβαλόντες ἄνωθεν ὃν φέροιεν ἀπῇσαν .
and others, while the body of a stranger was burning, would throw on the top of it the one they were carrying, and go away.

2.53.1
1318
 πρῶτόν τε ἦρξε καὶ ἐς τ- ἄλλα τῇ πόλει ἐπὶ πλέον ἀνομίας τὸ νόσημα .
In other respects also the plague was the origin of lawless conduct in the city, to a greater extent [than it had before existed].

2.53.1
1319
 ῥᾷον γὰρ ἐτόλμα τις ἃ πρότερον ἀπεκρύπτετο μὴ καθ’ ἡδονὴν ποιεῖν , ἀγχίστροφον τὴν μεταβολὴν ὁρῶντες τῶν τε εὐδαιμόνων καὶ αἰφνιδίως θνῃσκόντων καὶ τῶν οὐδὲν πρότερον κεκτημένων , εὐθὺς δὲ τ- ἐκείνων ἐχόντων .
For deeds which formerly men hid from view, so as not to do them just as they pleased, they now more readily ventured on; since they saw the change so sudden in the case of those who were prosperous and quickly perished, and of those who before had had nothing, and at once came into possession of the property of the dead.

2.53.2
1320
 ὥστε ταχείας τὰς ἐπαυρέσεις καὶ πρὸς τὸ τερπνὸν ἠξίουν ποιεῖσθαι , ἐφήμερα τά τε σώματα καὶ τὰ χρήματα ὁμοίως ἡγούμενοι .
So they resolved to take their enjoyment quickly, and with a sole view to gratification; regarding their lives and their riches alike as things of a day.

2.53.3
1321
 καὶ τὸ μὲν προσταλαιπωρεῖν τῷ δόξαντι καλῷ οὐδεὶς πρόθυμος ἦν , ἄδηλον νομίζων εἰ πρὶν ἐπ’ αὐτὸ ἐλθεῖν διαφθαρήσεται ·
As for taking trouble about what was thought honourable, no one was forward to do it; deeming it uncertain whether, before he had attained to it, he would not be cut off;

2.53.3
1322
 ὅτι δὲ ἤδη τε ἡδὺ πανταχόθεν τε ἐς αὐτὸ κερδαλέον , τοῦτο καὶ καλὸν καὶ χρήσιμον κατέστη .
but everything that was immediately pleasant, and that which was conducive to it by any means whatever, this was laid down to be both honourable and expedient.

2.53.4
1323
 θεῶν δὲ φόβος ἢ ἀνθρώπων νόμος οὐδεὶς ἀπεῖργε , τὸ μὲν κρίνοντες ἐν ὁμοίῳ καὶ σέβειν καὶ μὴ ἐκ τοῦ πάντας ὁρᾶν ἐν ἴσῳ ἀπολλυμένους , τῶν δὲ ἁμαρτημάτων οὐδεὶς ἐλπίζων μέχρι τοῦ δίκην γενέσθαι βιοὺς ἂν τὴν τιμωρίαν ἀντιδοῦναι , πολὺ δὲ μείζω τὴν ἤδη κατεψηφισμένην σφῶν ἐπικρεμασθῆναι , ἣν πρὶν ἐμπεσεῖν εἰκὸς εἶναι τοῦ βίου τι ἀπολαῦσαι .
And fear of gods, or law of men, there was none to stop them; for with regard to the former they esteemed it all the same whether they worshipped them or not, from seeing all alike perishing; and with regard to their offences [against the latter], no one expected to live till judgment should be passed on him, and so to pay the penalty of them; but they thought a far heavier sentence was impending in that which had already been passed upon them; and that before it fell on them, it was right to have some enjoyment of life.

2.54.1
1324
 τοιούτῳ μὲν πάθει οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι περιπεσόντες ἐπιέζοντο , ἀνθρώπων τ’ ἔνδον θνῃσκόντων καὶ γῆς ἔξω δῃουμένης .
Such was the calamity which the Athenians had met with, and by which they were afflicted, their men dying within the city, and their land being wasted without.

2.54.2
1325
 ἐν δὲ τῷ κακῷ οἷα εἰκὸς ἀνεμνήσθησαν καὶ τοῦδε τοῦ ἔπους , φάσκοντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι πάλαι ᾄδεσθαι &quot; ἥξει Δωριακὸς πόλεμος καὶ λοιμὸς ἅμ’ αὐτῷ &quot; .
In their misery they remembered this verse amongst other things, as was natural they should; the old men saying that it had been uttered long ago; "A Dorian war shall come, and plague faith it."

2.54.3
1326
 ἐγένετο μὲν οὖν ἔρις τοῖς ἀνθρώποις μὴ λοιμὸν ὠνομάσθαι ἐν τῷ ἔπει ὑπὸ τῶν παλαιῶν , ἀλλὰ λιμόν , ἐνίκησε δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος εἰκότως λοιμὸν εἰρῆσθαι ·
Now there was a dispute amongst them, [and some asserted,] that it was not "a plague" that had been mentioned in the verse by the men of former times, but "a famine";

2.54.3
1327
 οἱ γὰρ ἄνθρωποι πρὸς ἃ ἔπασχον τὴν μνήμην ἐποιοῦντο .
the opinion, however, at the present time naturally prevailed that "a plague" had been mentioned: for men adapted their recollections to what they were suffering.

2.54.3
1328
 ἢν δέ γε οἶμαί ποτε ἄλλος πόλεμος καταλάβῃ Δωρικὸς τοῦδε ὕστερος καὶ ξυμβῇ γενέσθαι λιμόν , κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς οὕτως ᾄσονται .
But, I suppose, in case of another Dorian war ever befalling them after this, and a famine happening to exist, in all probability they will recite the verse accordingly.

2.54.4
1329
 μνήμη δὲ ἐγένετο καὶ τοῦ Λακεδαιμονίων χρηστηρίου τοῖς εἰδόσιν , ὅτε ἐπερωτῶσιν αὐτοῖς τὸν θεὸν εἰ χρὴ πολεμεῖν ἀνεῖλε κατὰ κράτος πολεμοῦσι νίκην ἔσεσθαι , καὶ αὐτὸς ἔφη ξυλλήψεσθαι .
Those who were acquainted with it recollected also the oracle given to the Lacedaemonians, when on their inquiring of the god whether they should go to war, he answered, " that if they carried it on with all their might, they would gain the victory;"

2.54.5
1330
 περὶ μὲν οὖν τοῦ χρηστηρίου τὰ γιγνόμενα ᾔκαζον ὁμοῖα εἶναι ·
With regard to the oracle then, they supposed that what was happening answered to it.

2.54.5
1331
 ἐσβεβληκότων δὲ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ἡ νόσος ἤρξατο εὐθύς , καὶ ἐς μὲν Πελοπόννησον οὐκ ἐσῆλθεν , ὅτι καὶ ἄξιον εἰπεῖν , ἐπενείματο δὲ Ἀθήνας μὲν μάλιστα , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων χωρίων τὰ πολυανθρωπότατα .
For the disease had begun immediately after the Lacedaemonians had made their incursion; and it did not go into the Peloponnese, worth even speaking of, but ravaged Athens most of all, and next to it the most populous of the other towns.

2.54.5
1332
 ταῦτα μὲν τὰ κατὰ τὴν νόσον γενόμενα .
Such were the circumstances that occurred in connection with the plague.

2.55.1
1333
 οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐπειδὴ ἔτεμον τὸ πεδίον , παρῆλθον ἐς τὴν Πάραλον γῆν καλουμένην μέχρι Λαυρείου , οὗ τὰ ἀργύρεια μέταλλά ἐστιν Ἀθηναίοις .
The Peloponnesians, after ravaging the plain, passed into the Paralian territory, as it is called, as far as Laurium, where the gold mines of the Athenians are situated.

2.55.1
1334
 καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ἔτεμον ταύτην ᾗ πρὸς Πελοπόννησον ὁρᾷ , ἔπειτα δὲ τὴν πρὸς Εὔβοιάν τε καὶ Ἄνδρον τετραμμένην .
And first they ravaged the side which looks towards Peloponnese; afterwards, that which lies towards Euboea and Andrus.

2.55.2
1335
 Περικλῆς δὲ στρατηγὸς ὢν καὶ τότε περὶ μὲν τοῦ μὴ ἐπεξιέναι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τὴν αὐτὴν γνώμην εἶχεν ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν τῇ προτέρᾳ ἐσβολῇ .
Now Pericles being general at that time as well as before, maintained the same opinion as he had in the former invasion about the Athenians not marching out against them.

2.56.1
1336
 ἔτι δ’ αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ὄντων , πρὶν ἐς τὴν παραλίαν ἐλθεῖν , ἑκατὸν νεῶν ἐπίπλουν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ παρεσκευάζετο , καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἑτοῖμα ἦν , ἀνήγετο .
While they were still in the plain, before they went to the Paralian territory, he was preparing an armament of a hundred ships to sail against the Peloponnese;

2.56.2
1337
 ἦγε δ’ ἐπὶ τῶν νεῶν ὁπλίτας Ἀθηναίων τετρακισχιλίους καὶ ἱππέας τριακοσίους ἐν ναυσὶν ἱππαγωγοῖς πρῶτον τότε ἐκ τῶν παλαιῶν νεῶν ποιηθείσαις ·
On board the ships he took four thousand heavy-armed of the Athenians, and three hundred cavalry in horse-transports, then for the first time made out of old vessels;

2.56.2
1338
 ξυνεστρατεύοντο δὲ καὶ Χῖοι καὶ Λέσβιοι πεντήκοντα ναυσίν .
and the Chians and Lesbians also joined in the expedition with fifty ships.

2.56.3
1339
 ὅτε δὲ ἀνήγετο ἡ στρατιὰ αὕτη Ἀθηναίων , Πελοποννησίους κατέλιπον τῆς Ἀττικῆς ὄντας ἐν τῇ παραλίᾳ .
a Chian and Lesbian force also joined the expedition with fifty ships.

2.56.4
1340
 ἀφικόμενοι δὲ ἐς Ἐπίδαυρον τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἔτεμον τῆς γῆς τὴν πολλήν , καὶ πρὸς τὴν πόλιν προσβαλόντες ἐς ἐλπίδα μὲν ἦλθον τοῦ ἑλεῖν , οὐ μέντοι προυχώρησέ γε .
When this armament of the Athenians put out to sea, they left the Peloponnesians in the Paralian territory of Attica. On arriving at Epidaurus, in the Peloponnese, they ravaged the greater part of the land, and having made an assault on the city, entertained some hope of taking it;

2.56.5
1341
 ἀναγαγόμενοι δὲ ἐκ τῆς Ἐπιδαύρου ἔτεμον τήν τε Τροιζηνίδα γῆν καὶ Ἁλιάδα καὶ Ἑρμιονίδα ·
After sailing from Epidaurus, they ravaged the land belonging to Troezen, Haliae, and Hermione;

2.56.5
1342
 ἔστι δὲ ταῦτα πάντα ἐπιθαλάσσια τῆς Πελοποννήσου .
all which places are on the coast of the Peloponnese.

2.56.6
1343
 ἄραντες δὲ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἀφίκοντο ἐς Πρασιὰς τῆς Λακωνικῆς πόλισμα ἐπιθαλάσσιον , καὶ τῆς τε γῆς ἔτεμον καὶ αὐτὸ τὸ πόλισμα εἷλον καὶ ἐπόρθησαν .
Proceeding thence they came to Prasiae, a maritime town of Laconia, and ravaged some of the land, and took the town itself, and sacked it.

2.56.6
1344
 ταῦτα δὲ ποιήσαντες ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀνεχώρησαν .
After performing these achievements, they returned home;

2.56.6
1345
 τοὺς δὲ Πελοποννησίους οὐκέτι κατέλαβον ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ὄντας , ἀλλ’ ἀνακεχωρηκότας .
and found the Peloponnesians no longer in Attica, but returned.

2.57.1
1346
 ὅσον δὲ χρόνον οἵ τε Πελοποννήσιοι ἦσαν ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ Ἀθηναίων καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐστράτευον ἐπὶ τῶν νεῶν , ἡ νόσος ἔν τε τῇ στρατιᾷ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἔφθειρε καὶ ἐν τῇ πόλει , ὥστε καὶ ἐλέχθη τοὺς Πελοποννησίους δείσαντας τὸ νόσημα , ὡς ἐπυνθάνοντο τῶν αὐτομόλων ὅτι ἐν τῇ πόλει εἴη καὶ θάπτοντας ἅμα ᾐσθάνοντο , θᾶσσον ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἐξελθεῖν .
Now all the time that the Peloponnesians were in the Athenian territory, and the Athenians were engaged in the expedition on board their ships, the plague was carrying them off both in the armament and in the city, so that it was even said that the Peloponnesians, for fear of the disorder, when they heard from the deserters that it was in the city, and also perceived them performing the funeral rites, retired the quicker from the country.

2.57.2
1347
 τῇ δὲ ἐσβολῇ ταύτῃ πλεῖστόν τε χρόνον ἐνέμειναν καὶ τὴν γῆν πᾶσαν ἔτεμον ·
Yet in this invasion they stayed the longest time, and ravaged the whole country;

2.57.2
1348
 ἡμέρας γὰρ τεσσαράκοντα μάλιστα ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ Ἀττικῇ ἐγένοντο .
for they were about forty days in the Athenian territory.

2.58.1
1349
 τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους Ἅγνων ὁ Νικίου καὶ Κλεόπομπος ὁ Κλεινίου , ξυστράτηγοι ὄντες Περικλέους , λαβόντες τὴν στρατιὰν ᾗπερ ἐκεῖνος ἐχρήσατο ἐστράτευσαν εὐθὺς ἐπὶ Χαλκιδέας τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης καὶ Ποτείδαιαν ἔτι πολιορκουμένην , ἀφικόμενοι δὲ μηχανάς τε τῇ Ποτειδαίᾳ προσέφερον καὶ παντὶ τρόπῳ ἐπειρῶντο ἑλεῖν .
The same summer Hagnon son of Nicias, and Cleopompus son of Clinias, who were colleagues with Pericles, took the army which he had employed, and went straightway on an expedition against the Chalcidians Thrace-ward, and Potidaea, which was still being besieged: and on their arrival they brought up their engines against Potidaea, and endeavoured to take it by every means.

2.58.2
1350
 προυχώρει δὲ αὐτοῖς οὔτε ἡ αἵρεσις τῆς πόλεως οὔτε τ- ἄλλα τῆς παρασκευῆς ἀξίως ·
But they neither succeeded in capturing the city, nor in their other measures, to any extent worthy of their preparations;

2.58.2
1351
 ἐπιγενομένη γὰρ ἡ νόσος ἐνταῦθα δὴ πάνυ ἐπίεσε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , φθείρουσα τὴν στρατιάν , ὥστε καὶ τοὺς προτέρους στρατιώτας νοσῆσαι τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπὸ τῆς ξὺν Ἅγνωνι στρατιᾶς , ἐν τῷ πρὸ τοῦ χρόνῳ ὑγιαίνοντας .
for the plague attacked them, and this indeed utterly overpowered them there, wasting their force to such a degree, that even the soldiers of the Athenians who were there before were infected with it by the troops which came with Hagnon, though previously they had been in good health.

2.58.2
1352
 Φορμίων δὲ καὶ οἱ ἑξακόσιοι καὶ χίλιοι οὐκέτι ἦσαν περὶ Χαλκιδέας .
Phormio, however, and his sixteen hundred, were no longer in the neighbourhood of the Chalcidians [and so escaped its ravages].

2.58.3
1353
 ὁ μὲν οὖν Ἅγνων ἀνεχώρησε ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας , ἀπὸ τετρακισχιλίων ὁπλιτῶν χιλίους καὶ πεντήκοντα τῇ νόσῳ ἀπολέσας ἐν τεσσαράκοντα μάλιστα ἡμέραις ·
Hagnon therefore returned with his ships to Athens, having lost by the plague fifteen hundred out of four thousand heavy-armed, in about forty days;

2.58.3
1354
 οἱ δὲ πρότεροι στρατιῶται κατὰ χώραν μένοντες ἐπολιόρκουν τὴν Ποτείδαιαν .
the soldiers who were there before still remained in the country, and continued the siege of Potidaea.

2.59.1
1355
 μετὰ δὲ τὴν δευτέραν ἐσβολὴν τῶν Πελοποννησίων οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὡς ἥ τε γῆ αὐτῶν ἐτέτμητο τὸ δεύτερον καὶ ἡ νόσος ἐπέκειτο ἅμα καὶ ὁ πόλεμος , ἠλλοίωντο τὰς γνώμας , καὶ τὸν μὲν Περικλέα ἐν αἰτίᾳ εἶχον ὡς πείσαντα σφᾶς πολεμεῖν καὶ δι’ ἐκεῖνον ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς περιπεπτωκότες ,πρὸς δὲ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ὥρμηντο ξυγχωρεῖν ·
After the second invasion of the Lacedaemonians, the Athenians, when their land had been again ravaged, and the disease and the war were afflicting them at the same time, changed their views, and found fault with Pericles, thinking that he had persuaded them to go to war, and that it was through him that they had met with their misfortunes;

2.59.2
1356
 καὶ πρέσβεις τινὰς πέμψαντες ὡς αὐτοὺς ἄπρακτοι ἐγένοντο .
and they were eager to come to terms with the Lacedaemonians.

2.59.2
1357
 πανταχόθεν τε τῇ γνώμῃ ἄποροι καθεστηκότες ἐνέκειντο τῷ Περικλεῖ .
Indeed they sent ambassadors to them, but did not succeed in their object. And their minds being on all sides reduced to despair, they were violent against Pericles.

2.59.3
1358
 ὁ δὲ ὁρῶν αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὰ παρόντα χαλεπαίνοντας καὶ πάντα ποιοῦντας ἅπερ αὐτὸς ἤλπιζε , ξύλλογον ποιήσας ( ἔτι δ’ ἐστρατήγει ) ἐβούλετο θαρσῦναί τε καὶ ἀπαγαγὼν τὸ ὀργιζόμενον τῆς γνώμης πρὸς τὸ ἠπιώτερον καὶ ἀδεέστερον καταστῆσαι ·
He therefore, seeing them irritated by their present circumstances, and doing every thing that he had himself expected them to do, called an assembly, (for he was still general,) wishing to cheer them, and by drawing off the irritation of their feelings to lead them to a calmer and more confident state of mind.

2.59.3
1359
 παρελθὼν δὲ ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
So he came forward and spoke as follows:

2.60.1
1360
 &quot; καὶ προσδεχομένῳ μοι τὰ τῆς ὀργῆς ὑμῶν ἔς με γεγένηται ( αἰσθάνομαι γὰρ τὰς αἰτίας ) καὶ ἐκκλησίαν τούτου ἕνεκα ξυνήγαγον , ὅπως ὑπομνήσω καὶ μέμψωμαι εἴ τι μὴ ὀρθῶς ἢ ἐμοὶ χαλεπαίνετε ἢ ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς εἴκετε .
"I had both expected the proofs of your anger against me, which have been exhibited, (for I am aware of the causes of it,) and have now convened an assembly for this purpose, that I may remind you [of what you have forgotten], and reprove you if in any respect you are wrong, either in being irritated against me or in succumbing to your misfortunes.

2.60.2
1361
 ἐγὼ γὰρ ἡγοῦμαι πόλιν πλείω ξύμπασαν ὀρθουμένην ὠφελεῖν τοὺς ἰδιώτας ἢ καθ’ ἕκαστον τῶν πολιτῶν εὐπραγοῦσαν , ἁθρόαν δὲ σφαλλομένην .
For I consider that a state which in its public capacity is successful confers more benefit on individuals, than one which is prosperous as regards its particular citizens, while collectively it comes to ruin.

2.60.3
1362
 καλῶς μὲν γὰρ φερόμενος ἀνὴρ τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν διαφθειρομένης τῆς πατρίδος οὐδὲν ἧσσον ξυναπόλλυται , κακοτυχῶν δὲ ἐν εὐτυχούσῃ πολλῷ μᾶλλον διασῴζεται .
For though a man is individually prosperous, yet if his country is ruined, he none the less shares in its destruction; whereas, if he is unfortunate in a country that is fortunate, he has a much better hope of escaping his dangers.

2.60.4
1363
 ὁπότε οὖν πόλις μὲν τὰς ἰδίας ξυμφορὰς οἵα τε φέρειν , εἷς δ’ ἕκαστος τὰς ἐκείνης ἀδύνατος , πῶς οὐ χρὴ πάντας ἀμύνειν αὐτῇ , καὶ μὴ ὃ νῦν ὑμεῖς δρᾶτε ·
Since then a state is able to bear the misfortunes of individuals, while each individual is unable to bear hers, how can it fail to be the duty of all to support her,

2.60.4
1364
 ταῖς κατ’ οἶκον κακοπραγίαις ἐκπεπληγμένοι τοῦ κοινοῦ τῆς σωτηρίας ἀφίεσθε , καὶ ἐμέ τε τὸν παραινέσαντα πολεμεῖν καὶ ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς οἳ ξυνέγνωτε δι’ αἰτίας ἔχετε .
and not to act as are now doing, who, being panic-stricken by your domestic afflictions, give up all thought of the public safety, and are blaming both me who advised you to go to war, and yourselves who joined in voting for it.

2.60.5
1365
 καίτοι ἐμοὶ τοιούτῳ ἀνδρὶ ὀργίζεσθε ὃς οὐδενὸς ἥσσων οἴομαι εἶναι γνῶναί τε τὰ δέοντα καὶ ἑρμηνεῦσαι ταῦτα , φιλόπολίς τε καὶ χρημάτων κρείσσων .
And yet I, with whom you are angry, am a man who deem myself second to none in at once knowing what measures are required, and explaining them to others; a lover too of my country, and superior to the influence of money.

2.60.6
1366
 ὅ τε γὰρ γνοὺς καὶ μὴ σαφῶς διδάξας ἐν ἴσῳ καὶ εἰ μὴ ἐνεθυμήθη ·
For he who knows a thing that is right, but does not explain it with clearness is no better than if he had never had a conception of it;

2.60.6
1367
 ὅ τε ἔχων ἀμφότερα , τῇ δὲ πόλει δύσνους , οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως τι οἰκείως φράζοι ·
and he, again, who has both these requisites, but is ill-affected toward his country, would not so well speak for her interest.

2.60.6
1368
 προσόντος δὲ καὶ τοῦδε , χρήμασι δὲ νικωμένου , τὰ ξύμπαντα τούτου ἑνὸς ἂν πωλοῖτο .
And even this qualification be added to the others, while he is influenced by regard for money, all of them together would be sacrificed for this one consideration.

2.60.7
1369
 ὥστ’ εἴ μοι καὶ μέσως ἡγούμενοι μᾶλλον ἑτέρων προσεῖναι αὐτὰ πολεμεῖν ἐπείσθητε , οὐκ ἂν εἰκότως νῦν τοῦ γε ἀδικεῖν αἰτίαν φεροίμην .
So that if you were persuaded by me to go to war, because you thought that I possessed these qualities even in a moderate degree more than other men, I cannot now fairly be charged with injuring you, at any rate.

2.61.1
1370
 &quot; καὶ γὰρ οἷς μὲν αἵρεσις γεγένηται τ- ἄλλα εὐτυχοῦσι , πολλὴ ἄνοια πολεμῆσαι ·
"For those indeed to go to war, who, while successful in other things, have had a choice in the matter allowed them, it is great folly.

2.61.1
1371
 εἰ δ’ ἀναγκαῖον ἦν ἢ εἴξαντας εὐθὺς τοῖς πέλας ὑπακοῦσαι ἢ κινδυνεύσαντας περιγενέσθαι , ὁ φυγὼν τὸν κίνδυνον τοῦ ὑποστάντος μεμπτότερος .
But if [in our case] it were necessary, either immediately to submit to our neighbours, if we made concessions, or to preserve our independence by running a great risk; then he who shrank from the risk is more reprehensible than he who faced it.

2.61.2
1372
 καὶ ἐγὼ μὲν ὁ αὐτός εἰμι καὶ οὐκ ἐξίσταμαι ·
For my part then, I am the same that I ever was, and do not depart from my opinion;

2.61.2
1373
 ὑμεῖς δὲ μεταβάλλετε , ἐπειδὴ ξυνέβη ὑμῖν πεισθῆναι μὲν ἀκεραίοις , μεταμέλειν δὲ κακουμένοις , καὶ τὸν ἐμὸν λόγον ἐν τῷ ὑμετέρῳ ἀσθενεῖ τῆς γνώμης μὴ ὀρθὸν φαίνεσθαι , διότι τὸ μὲν λυποῦν ἔχει ἤδη τὴν αἴσθησιν ἑκάστῳ , τῆς δὲ ὠφελίας ἄπεστιν ἔτι ἡ δήλωσις ἅπασι , καὶ μεταβολῆς μεγάλης , καὶ ταύτης ἐξ ὀλίγου , ἐμπεσούσης ταπεινὴ ὑμῶν ἡ διάνοια ἐγκαρτερεῖν ἃ ἔγνωτε .
but you are changing, since it happens that you were persuaded [to go to war] while unscathed, but repent of it now you are suffering: and that my advice appears wrong through the weakness of your resolution; because pain is now in possession of each man's feeling, while the certainty of the benefit is as yet hidden from all: and a great reverse having befallen you, and that suddenly, your mind is too prostrated to persevere in your determinations.

2.61.3
1374
 δουλοῖ γὰρ φρόνημα τὸ αἰφνίδιον καὶ ἀπροσδόκητον καὶ τὸ πλείστῳ παραλόγῳ ξυμβαῖνον ·
For the spirit is enslaved by what is sudden and unlooked for, and most beyond our calculation;

2.61.3
1375
 ὃ ὑμῖν πρὸς τοῖς ἄλλοις οὐχ ἥκιστα καὶ κατὰ τὴν νόσον γεγένηται .
which has been your case, in addition to everything else, more especially with regard to the plague.

2.61.4
1376
 ὅμως δὲ πόλιν μεγάλην οἰκοῦντας καὶ ἐν ἤθεσιν ἀντιπάλοις αὐτῇ τεθραμμένους χρεὼν καὶ ξυμφοραῖς ταῖς μεγίσταις ἐθέλειν ὑφίστασθαι καὶ τὴν ἀξίωσιν μὴ ἀφανίζειν ( ἐν ἴσῳ γὰρ οἱ ἄνθρωποι δικαιοῦσι τῆς τε ὑπαρχούσης δόξης αἰτιᾶσθαι ὅστις μαλακίᾳ ἐλλείπει καὶ τῆς μὴ προσηκούσης μισεῖν τὸν θρασύτητι ὀρεγόμενον ) , ἀπαλγήσαντας δὲ τὰ ἴδια τοῦ κοινοῦ τῆς σωτηρίας ἀντιλαμβάνεσθαι .
Living, however, as you do in a great city, and brought up with habits corresponding to it, you ought to be willing to encounter the greatest misfortunes, and not to sully your reputation; (for men think it equally just to find fault with him who weakly falls short of his proper character, and to hate him who rashly grasps at that which does not belong to him;) and you ought to cease grieving for your private sufferings, and to devote yourselves to the safety of the commonwealth.

2.62.1
1377
 &quot; τὸν δὲ πόνον τὸν κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον , μὴ γένηταί τε πολὺς καὶ οὐδὲν μᾶλλον περιγενώμεθα , ἀρκείτω μὲν ὑμῖν καὶ ἐκεῖνα ἐν οἷς ἄλλοτε πολλάκις γε δὴ ἀπέδειξα οὐκ ὀρθῶς αὐτὸν ὑποπτευόμενον , δηλώσω δὲ καὶ τόδε , ὅ μοι δοκεῖτε οὔτ’ αὐτοὶ πώποτε ἐνθυμηθῆναι ὑπάρχον ὑμῖν μεγέθους πέρι ἐς τὴν ἀρχὴν οὔτ’ ἐγὼ ἐν τοῖς πρὶν λόγοις ·
"But with regard to your trouble in the war, lest you should fear that it may prove great, and we may still be none the more successful, let those arguments suffice you, with which on many other occasions I have proved the error of your suspicions respecting it.

2.62.1
1378
 οὐδ’ ἂν νῦν ἐχρησάμην κομπωδεστέραν ἔχοντι τὴν προσποίησιν , εἰ μὴ καταπεπληγμένους ὑμᾶς παρὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἑώρων .
At the same time, I will also lay before you the following advantage, which yourselves do not appear ever yet to have thought of as belonging to you, respecting the greatness of your empire, and which I never urged in my former speeches; nor would I even now, as it has rather too boastful an air, if I did not see you unreasonably cast down.

2.62.2
1379
 οἴεσθε μὲν γὰρ τῶν ξυμμάχων μόνων ἄρχειν , ἐγὼ δὲ ἀποφαίνω δύο μερῶν τῶν ἐς χρῆσιν φανερῶν , γῆς καὶ θαλάσσης , τοῦ ἑτέρου ὑμᾶς παντὸς κυριωτάτους ὄντας , ἐφ’ ὅσον τε νῦν νέμεσθε καὶ ἢν ἐπὶ πλέον βουληθῆτε ·
You think then that you only bear rule over your own subject allies; but I declare to you that of the two parts of the world open for man's use, the land and the sea, of the whole of the one you are most absolute masters, both as far as you avail yourselves of it now, and if you should wish to do so still further;

2.62.2
1380
 καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅστις τῇ ὑπαρχούσῃ παρασκευῇ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ πλέοντας ὑμᾶς οὔτε βασιλεὺς οὔτε ἄλλο οὐδὲν ἔθνος τῶν ἐν τῷ παρόντι κωλύσει .
and there is no power, neither the king nor any nation besides at the present day, that can prevent your sailing [where you please] with your present naval resources.

2.62.3
1381
 ὥστε οὐ κατὰ τὴν τῶν οἰκιῶν καὶ τῆς γῆς χρείαν , ὧν μεγάλων νομίζετε ἐστερῆσθαι , αὕτη ἡ δύναμις φαίνεται ·
This power then evidently is far from being merely on a level with the benefits of your houses and lands, which you think so much to be deprived of:

2.62.3
1382
 οὐδ’ εἰκὸς χαλεπῶς φέρειν αὐτῶν μᾶλλον ἢ οὐ κηπίον καὶ ἐγκαλλώπισμα πλούτου πρὸς ταύτην νομίσαντας ὀλιγωρῆσαι , καὶ γνῶναι ἐλευθερίαν μέν , ἢν ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι αὐτῆς διασώσωμεν , ῥᾳδίως ταῦτα ἀναληψομένην , ἄλλων δὲ ὑπακούσασι καὶ τὰ προκεκτημένα φιλεῖν ἐλασσοῦσθαι , τῶν τε πατέρων μὴ χείρους κατ’ ἀμφότερα φανῆναι , οἳ μετὰ πόνων καὶ οὐ παρ’ ἄλλων δεξάμενοι κατέσχον τε καὶ προσέτι διασώσαντες παρέδοσαν ὑμῖν αὐτά ( αἴσχιον δὲ ἔχοντας ἀφαιρεθῆναι ἢ κτωμένους ἀτυχῆσαι ) , ἰέναι δὲ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ὁμόσε μὴ φρονήματι μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ καταφρονήματι .
nor is it right for you to grieve about them, but rather to hold them cheap, considering them, in comparison with this, as a mere garden-plot and embellishment of a rich man's estate. You should know, too, that liberty, provided we devote ourselves to and preserve it, will easily recover these losses; whereas those who have once submitted to others find even their greatest gains diminish. Nor should you show yourselves inferior in both respects to your fathers, who with labour, and not by inheritance from others, acquired these possessions, and moreover kept them, and bequeathed them to us (for it is more disgraceful to be deprived of a thing when we have got it, than to fail in getting it). On the contrary, you should meet your enemies, not only with spirit, but also with a spirit of contempt.

2.62.4
1383
 αὔχημα μὲν γὰρ καὶ ἀπὸ ἀμαθίας εὐτυχοῦς καὶ δειλῷ τινὶ ἐγγίγνεται , καταφρόνησις δὲ ὃς ἂν καὶ γνώμῃ πιστεύῃ τῶν ἐναντίων προύχειν , ὃ ἡμῖν ὑπάρχει .
For  is produced even by lucky ignorance, ay, even in a coward; but  is the feeling of the man who trusts that he is superior to his adversaries in counsel also, which is our case.

2.62.5
1384
 καὶ τὴν τόλμαν ἀπὸ τῆς ὁμοίας τύχης ἡ ξύνεσις ἐκ τοῦ ὑπέρφρονος ἐχυρωτέραν παρέχεται , ἐλπίδι τε ἧσσον πιστεύει , ἧς ἐν τῷ ἀπόρῳ ἡ ἰσχύς , γνώμῃ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων , ἧς βεβαιοτέρα ἡ πρόνοια .
And ability, with a high spirit, renders more sure the daring which arises from equal fortune; and does not so much trust to mere hope, whose strength mainly displays itself in difficulties; but rather to a judgment grounded upon present realities, whose anticipations may be more relied upon.

2.63.1
1385
 τῆς τε πόλεως ὑμᾶς εἰκὸς τῷ τιμωμένῳ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἄρχειν , ᾧπερ ἅπαντες ἀγάλλεσθε , βοηθεῖν , καὶ μὴ φεύγειν τοὺς πόνους ἢ μηδὲ τὰς τιμὰς διώκειν ·
"It is but fair, too, that you should sustain the dignity of the state derived from its sovereignty, on which you all pride yourselves; and that either you should not shrink from its labours, or else should lay no claim to its honours either.

2.63.1
1386
 μηδὲ νομίσαι περὶ ἑνὸς μόνου , δουλείας ἀντ’ ἐλευθερίας , ἀγωνίζεσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀρχῆς στερήσεως καὶ κινδύνου ὧν ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ ἀπήχθεσθε .
Nor should you suppose that you are struggling to escape one evil only, slavery instead of freedom; but to avoid loss of dominion also, and danger from the animosities which you have incurred in your exercise of that dominion.

2.63.2
1387
 ἧς οὐδ’ ἐκστῆναι ἔτι ὑμῖν ἔστιν , εἴ τις καὶ τόδε ἐν τῷ παρόντι δεδιὼς ἀπραγμοσύνῃ ἀνδραγαθίζεται ·
And from this it is no longer possible for you to retire; if through fear at the present time any one is for so playing the honest man in quiet.

2.63.2
1388
 ὡς τυραννίδα γὰρ ἤδη ἔχετε αὐτήν , ἣν λαβεῖν μὲν ἄδικον δοκεῖ εἶναι , ἀφεῖναι δὲ ἐπικίνδυνον .
For you now hold it as a tyranny, which it seems wrong to have assumed, but dangerous to give up.

2.63.3
1389
 τάχιστ’ ἄν τε πόλιν οἱ τοιοῦτοι ἑτέρους τε πείσαντες ἀπολέσειαν καὶ εἴ που ἐπὶ σφῶν αὐτῶν αὐτόνομοι οἰκήσειαν ·
And men with these views would very quickly ruin the state, whether they persuaded others [to adopt the same], or even lived anywhere independently by themselves;

2.63.3
1390
 τὸ γὰρ ἄπραγμον οὐ σῴζεται μὴ μετὰ τοῦ δραστηρίου τεταγμένον , οὐδὲ ἐν ἀρχούσῃ πόλει ξυμφέρει , ἀλλ’ ἐν ὑπηκόῳ , ἀσφαλῶς δουλεύειν .
for quietness is not a safe principle, unless ranged with activity; nor is it for the interest of a sovereign state, but of a subject one, that it may live in safe slavery.

2.64.1
1391
 &quot; ὑμεῖς δὲ μήτε ὑπὸ τῶν τοιῶνδε πολιτῶν παράγεσθε μήτε ἐμὲ δι’ ὀργῆς ἔχετε , ᾧ καὶ αὐτοὶ ξυνδιέγνωτε πολεμεῖν , εἰ καὶ ἐπελθόντες οἱ ἐναντίοι ἔδρασαν ἅπερ εἰκὸς ἦν μὴ ἐθελησάντων ὑμῶν ὑπακούειν , ἐπιγεγένηταί τε πέρα ὧν προσεδεχόμεθα ἡ νόσος ἥδε , πρᾶγμα μόνον δὴ τῶν πάντων ἐλπίδος κρεῖσσον γεγενημένον .
"Do you then neither be seduced by such citizens, nor be angry with me, whom yourselves also joined in voting for war, though the enemy has invaded our country, and done what it was natural that he should do, if you would not submit;

2.64.1
1392
 καὶ δι’ αὐτὴν οἶδ’ ὅτι μέρος τι μᾶλλον ἔτι μισοῦμαι , οὐ δικαίως , εἰ μὴ καὶ ὅταν παρὰ λόγον τι εὖ πράξητε ἐμοὶ ἀναθήσετε .
and though, besides what we looked for, this disease also has come upon us—the only thing, indeed, of all that has happened beyond our expectations. And it is through this, I well know, that in some degree I am still more the object of your displeasure;

2.64.2
1393
 φέρειν δὲ χρὴ τά τε δαιμόνια ἀναγκαίως τά τε ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων ἀνδρείως ·
yet not with justice, unless you will also give me the credit when you meet with any success beyond your calculation.

2.64.2
1394
 ταῦτα γὰρ ἐν ἔθει τῇδε τῇ πόλει πρότερόν τε ἦν νῦν τε μὴ ἐν ὑμῖν κωλυθῇ .
The evils then which are sent by heaven, you must bear perforce; those which are inflicted by your enemies with courage: for such was formerly the custom of this country, and let it not now meet with a check in your case.

2.64.3
1395
 γνῶτε δὲ ὄνομα μέγιστον αὐτὴν ἔχουσαν ἐν ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις διὰ τὸ ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς μὴ εἴκειν , πλεῖστα δὲ σώματα καὶ πόνους ἀνηλωκέναι πολέμῳ , καὶ δύναμιν μεγίστην δὴ μέχρι τοῦδε κεκτημένην , ἧς ἐς ἀΐδιον τοῖς ἐπιγιγνομένοις , ἢν καὶ νῦν ὑπενδῶμέν ποτε ( πάντα γὰρ πέφυκε καὶ ἐλασσοῦσθαι ) , μνήμη καταλελείψεται , Ἑλλήνων τε ὅτι Ἕλληνες πλείστων δὴ ἤρξαμεν , καὶ πολέμοις μεγίστοις ἀντέσχομεν πρός τε ξύμπαντας καὶ καθ’ ἑκάστους , πόλιν τε τοῖς πᾶσιν εὐπορωτάτην καὶ μεγίστην ᾠκήσαμεν .
" But consider that it has the greatest name in all the world from not yielding to misfortunes, and from expending in war more lives and labours than any other state; and that it has now the greatest power that ever existed up to the present time; the memory of which, even should we now at length give way, (for every thing is naturally liable to decrease,) will be left to posterity for ever, namely, that we had dominion over more Greeks than any other Greek state ever had; and held out in the greatest wars against them, both collectively and singly;"

2.64.4
1396
 καίτοι ταῦτα ὁ μὲν ἀπράγμων μέμψαιτ’ ἄν , ὁ δὲ δρᾶν τι καὶ αὐτὸς βουλόμενος ζηλώσει ·
"And inhabited a city better provided with all things than any other, and greater. And yet your quiet man would find fault with these things;

2.64.4
1397
 εἰ δέ τις μὴ κέκτηται , φθονήσει .
but the man who has himself a wish to achieve something, will emulate them; while whoever does not possess them will envy them.

2.64.5
1398
 τὸ δὲ μισεῖσθαι καὶ λυπηροὺς εἶναι ἐν τῷ παρόντι πᾶσι μὲν ὑπῆρξε δὴ ὅσοι ἕτεροι ἑτέρων ἠξίωσαν ἄρχειν ·
But the man who has himself a wish to achieve something, will emulate them; while whoever does not possess them will envy them.

2.64.5
1399
 ὅστις δὲ ἐπὶ μεγίστοις τὸ ἐπίφθονον λαμβάνει , ὀρθῶς βουλεύεται .
But to be hated and offensive for the time present has been the lot of all who ever presumed rule over others;

2.64.5
1400
 μῖσος μὲν γὰρ οὐκ ἐπὶ πολὺ ἀντέχει , ἡ δὲ παραυτίκα τε λαμπρότης καὶ ἐς τὸ ἔπειτα δόξα αἰείμνηστος καταλείπεται .
that man however, takes wise counsel, who incurs envy for the greatest things. For odium does not last long; but present splendour and future glory are handed down to perpetual memory.

2.64.6
1401
 ὑμεῖς δὲ ἔς τε τὸ μέλλον καλὸν προγνόντες ἔς τε τὸ αὐτίκα μὴ αἰσχρὸν τῷ ἤδη προθύμῳ ἀμφότερα κτήσασθε , καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις μήτε ἐπικηρυκεύεσθε μήτε ἔνδηλοι ἔστε τοῖς παροῦσι πόνοις βαρυνόμενοι , ὡς οἵτινες πρὸς τὰς ξυμφορὰς γνώμῃ μὲν ἥκιστα λυποῦνται , ἔργῳ δὲ μάλιστα ἀντέχουσιν , οὗτοι καὶ πόλεων καὶ ἰδιωτῶν κράτιστοί εἰσιν &quot; .
" Do you then, providing both for your future honour, and for your immediate escape from disgrace, secure both objects by your present spirit: and neither send any heralds to the Lacedaemonians, nor show that you are weighed down by your present troubles; for such as in feeling are least annoyed at their misfortunes, while in action they most courageously resist them, these, both of states and of individuals, are the best."

2.65.1
1402
 τοιαῦτα ὁ Περικλῆς λέγων ἐπειρᾶτο τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τῆς τε ἐς αὑτὸν ὀργῆς παραλύειν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν παρόντων δεινῶν ἀπάγειν τὴν γνώμην .
By speaking to this effect Pericles endeavoured both to divert the Athenians from their anger towards himself, and to lead away their thoughts from their present hardships.

2.65.2
1403
 οἱ δὲ δημοσίᾳ μὲν τοῖς λόγοις ἀνεπείθοντο καὶ οὔτε πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἔτι ἔπεμπον ἔς τε τὸν πόλεμον μᾶλλον ὥρμηντο , ἰδίᾳ δὲ τοῖς παθήμασιν ἐλυποῦντο , ὁ μὲν δῆμος ὅτι ἀπ’ ἐλασσόνων ὁρμώμενος ἐστέρητο καὶ τούτων , οἱ δὲ δυνατοὶ καλὰ κτήματα κατὰ τὴν χώραν οἰκοδομίαις τε καὶ πολυτελέσι κατασκευαῖς ἀπολωλεκότες , τὸ δὲ μέγιστον , πόλεμον ἀντ’ εἰρήνης ἔχοντες .
And in a public point of view they were persuaded by his speech, and were no longer for sending to the Lacedaemonians, but were more resolute for the war; though in their private feeling they were distressed by their sufferings; the commons, because, having set out with less resources, they had been deprived of even those; the higher orders, because they had lost fine possessions in the country, both in buildings and expensive establishments, and, what was the greatest evil of all, had war instead of peace.

2.65.3
1404
 οὐ μέντοι πρότερόν γε οἱ ξύμπαντες ἐπαύσαντο ἐν ὀργῇ ἔχοντες αὐτὸν πρὶν ἐζημίωσαν χρήμασιν .
They did not, however, cease from their public displeasure toward him, till they had fined him in a sum of money.

2.65.4
1405
 ὕστερον δ’ αὖθις οὐ πολλῷ , ὅπερ φιλεῖ ὅμιλος ποιεῖν , στρατηγὸν εἵλοντο καὶ πάντα τὰ πράγματα ἐπέτρεψαν , ὧν μὲν περὶ τὰ οἰκεῖα ἕκαστος ἤλγει ἀμβλύτεροι ἤδη ὄντες , ὧν δὲ ἡ ξύμπασα πόλις προσεδεῖτο πλείστου ἄξιον νομίζοντες εἶναι .
But no long time after, as the multitude to they again elected him general, and committed every thing to him; for on the points in which each man was vexed about his domestic affairs, they now felt less keenly; but with regard to what the whole state needed, they thought that he was most valuable.

2.65.5
1406
 ὅσον τε γὰρ χρόνον προύστη τῆς πόλεως ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ , μετρίως ἐξηγεῖτο καὶ ἀσφαλῶς διεφύλαξεν αὐτήν , καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπ’ ἐκείνου μεγίστη , ἐπειδή τε ὁ πόλεμος κατέστη , ὁ δὲ φαίνεται καὶ ἐν τούτῳ προγνοὺς τὴν δύναμιν .
For as long as he was at the head of the state in time of peace, he governed it with moderation, and kept it in safety, and it was at its height of greatness in his time: and when the war broke out, he appears to have foreknown its power in this respect also.

2.65.6
1407
 ἐπεβίω δὲ δύο ἔτη καὶ ἓξ μῆνας ·
He survived its commencement two years and six months;

2.65.6
1408
 καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἀπέθανεν , ἐπὶ πλέον ἔτι ἐγνώσθη ἡ πρόνοια αὐτοῦ ἡ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον .
and when he was dead, his foresight with regard to its course was appreciated to a still greater degree.

2.65.7
1409
 ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἡσυχάζοντάς τε καὶ τὸ ναυτικὸν θεραπεύοντας καὶ ἀρχὴν μὴ ἐπικτωμένους ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ μηδὲ τῇ πόλει κινδυνεύοντας ἔφη περιέσεσθαι ·
For he said that if they kept quiet and attended to their navy, and did not gain additional dominion during the war, nor expose the city to hazard, they would have the advantage in the struggle.

2.65.7
1410
 οἱ δὲ ταῦτά τε πάντα ἐς τ- ἐναντίον ἔπραξαν καὶ ἄλλα ἔξω τοῦ πολέμου δοκοῦντα εἶναι κατὰ τὰς ἰδίας φιλοτιμίας καὶ ἴδια κέρδη κακῶς ἔς τε σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐπολίτευσαν , ἃ κατορθούμενα μὲν τοῖς ἰδιώταις τιμὴ καὶ ὠφελία μᾶλλον ἦν , σφαλέντα δὲ τῇ πόλει ἐς τὸν πόλεμον βλάβη καθίστατο .
But they did the very contrary of all this, and in other things which seemed to have to do with the war, through their private ambition and private gain, they adopted evil measures both towards themselves and their allies; which, if successful, conducted the honour and benefit of individuals; but if they failed, proved detrimental to the state with regard to the war.

2.65.8
1411
 αἴτιον δ’ ἦν ὅτι ἐκεῖνος μὲν δυνατὸς ὢν τῷ τε ἀξιώματι καὶ τῇ γνώμῃ χρημάτων τε διαφανῶς ἀδωρότατος γενόμενος κατεῖχε τὸ πλῆθος ἐλευθέρως , καὶ οὐκ ἤγετο μᾶλλον ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἢ αὐτὸς ἦγε , διὰ τὸ μὴ κτώμενος ἐξ οὐ προσηκόντων τὴν δύναμιν πρὸς ἡδονήν τι λέγειν , ἀλλ’ ἔχων ἐπ’ ἀξιώσει καὶ πρὸς ὀργήν τι ἀντειπεῖν .
And the reason was, that he, being powerful by means of his high rank and talents, and manifestly proof against bribery, controlled the multiude with an independent spirit, and was not led by them so much as he himself led them; for he did not say any thing to humour them, for the acquisition of power by improper means; but was able on the strength of his character to contradict them even at the risk of their displeasure.

2.65.9
1412
 ὁπότε γοῦν αἴσθοιτό τι αὐτοὺς παρὰ καιρὸν ὕβρει θαρσοῦντας , λέγων κατέπλησσεν ἐπὶ τὸ φοβεῖσθαι , καὶ δεδιότας αὖ ἀλόγως ἀντικαθίστη πάλιν ἐπὶ τὸ θαρσεῖν .
Whenever, for instance, he perceived them unseasonably and insolently confident, by his language he would dash them down to alarm;

2.65.9
1413
 ἐγίγνετό τε λόγῳ μὲν δημοκρατία , ἔργῳ δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ πρώτου ἀνδρὸς ἀρχή .
and, on the other hand, when they were unreasonably alarmed, he would raise them again to confidence. And so, though in name it was democracy, in fact it was a government administered by the first man.

2.65.10
1414
 οἱ δὲ ὕστερον ἴσοι μᾶλλον αὐτοὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ὄντες καὶ ὀρεγόμενοι τοῦ πρῶτος ἕκαστος γίγνεσθαι ἐτράποντο καθ’ ἡδονὰς τῷ δήμῳ καὶ τὰ πράγματα ἐνδιδόναι .
Whereas those w o came after, being more on level with each other, and each grasping to become first, had recourse to devoting [not only their speeches, but] even their  to the humours of the people.

2.65.11
1415
 ἐξ ὧν ἄλλα τε πολλά , ὡς ἐν μεγάλῃ πόλει καὶ ἀρχὴν ἐχούσῃ , ἡμαρτήθη καὶ ὁ ἐς Σικελίαν πλοῦς , ὃς οὐ τοσοῦτον γνώμης ἁμάρτημα ἦν πρὸς οὓς ἐπῇσαν , ὅσον οἱ ἐκπέμψαντες οὐ τὰ πρόσφορα τοῖς οἰχομένοις ἐπιγιγνώσκοντες , ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὰς ἰδίας διαβολὰς περὶ τῆς τοῦ δήμου προστασίας τά τε ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ ἀμβλύτερα ἐποίουν καὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν πόλιν πρῶτον ἐν ἀλλήλοις ἐταράχθησαν .
In consequence of this both many other blunders were committed, as was likely in a great and sovereign state, and especially the expedition to Sicily; which was not so much an error of judgment with respect to the people they went against, as that those who had sent them out, by not afterwards voting supplies required by the armament, but proceeding with their private criminations, to gain the leadership of the commons, both blunted the spirit of measures in the camp, and for the first time were embroiled with one another in the affairs of the city.

2.65.12
1416
 σφαλέντες δὲ ἐν Σικελίᾳ ἄλλῃ τε παρασκευῇ καὶ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ τῷ πλέονι μορίῳ καὶ κατὰ τὴν πόλιν ἤδη ἐν στάσει ὄντες ὅμως † τρία † μὲν ἔτη ἀντεῖχον τοῖς τε πρότερον ὑπάρχουσι πολεμίοις καὶ τοῖς ἀπὸ Σικελίας μετ’ αὐτῶν , καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἔτι τοῖς πλέοσιν ἀφεστηκόσι , Κύρῳ τε ὕστερον βασιλέως παιδὶ προσγενομένῳ , ὃς παρεῖχε χρήματα Πελοποννησίοις ἐς τὸ ναυτικόν , καὶ οὐ πρότερον ἐνέδοσαν ἢ αὐτοὶ ἐν σφίσι κατὰ τὰς ἰδίας διαφορὰς περιπεσόντες ἐσφάλησαν .
But even when they had suffered in Sicily the loss of other forces, and of the greater part of their fleet, and were now involved in sedition at home, they nevertheless held out three years, both against their former enemies, and those from Sicily with them, and moreover against the greater part of their allies who had revolted, and Cyrus, the king's son, who afterwards joined them, and who supplied the Peloponnesians with money for their fleet: nor did they succumb, before they were overthrown and ruined by themselves, through their private quarrels.

2.65.13
1417
 τοσοῦτον τῷ Περικλεῖ ἐπερίσσευσε τότε ἀφ’ ὧν αὐτὸς προέγνω καὶ πάνυ ἂν ῥᾳδίως περιγενέσθαι τὴν πόλιν Πελοποννησίων αὐτῶν τῷ πολέμῳ .
Such a superabundance of means had Pericles at that time, by which he himself foresaw that with the greatest ease he could gain the advantage in the war over the Peloponnesians by themselves.

2.66.1
1418
 οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους ἐστράτευσαν ναυσὶν ἑκατὸν ἐς Ζάκυνθον τὴν νῆσον , ἣ κεῖται ἀντιπέρας Ἤλιδος ·
The Lacedaemonians and their allies the same summer made an expedition with a hundred ships against the island of Zacynthus, which lies over against Elis.

2.66.1
1419
 εἰσὶ δὲ Ἀχαιῶν τῶν ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ἄποικοι καὶ Ἀθηναίοις ξυνεμάχουν .
The inhabitants are a colony of the Achaeans of the Peloponnesus, and were in alliance with the Athenians.

2.66.2
1420
 ἐπέπλεον δὲ Λακεδαιμονίων χίλιοι ὁπλῖται καὶ Κνῆμος Σπαρτιάτης ναύαρχος .
On board the fleet were a thousand heavy-armed of the Lacedaemonians, and Cnemus, a Spartan, as admiral.

2.66.2
1421
 ἀποβάντες δὲ ἐς τὴν γῆν ἐδῄωσαν τὰ πολλά .
Having made a descent on the country, they ravaged the greater part of it;

2.66.2
1422
 καὶ ἐπειδὴ οὐ ξυνεχώρουν , ἀπέπλευσαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
and when they did not surrender, they sailed back home.

2.67.1
1423
 καὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους τελευτῶντος Ἀριστεὺς Κορίνθιος καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων πρέσβεις Ἀνήριστος καὶ Νικόλαος καὶ Πρατόδαμος καὶ Τεγεάτης Τιμαγόρας καὶ Ἀργεῖος ἰδίᾳ Πόλλις , πορευόμενοι ἐς τὴν Ἀσίαν ὡς βασιλέα , εἴ πως πείσειαν αὐτὸν χρήματά τε παρασχεῖν καὶ ξυμπολεμεῖν , ἀφικνοῦνται ὡς Σιτάλκην πρῶτον τὸν Τήρεω ἐς Θρᾴκην , βουλόμενοι πεῖσαί τε αὐτόν , εἰ δύναιντο , μεταστάντα τῆς Ἀθηναίων ξυμμαχίας στρατεῦσαι ἐπὶ τὴν Ποτείδαιαν , οὗ ἦν στράτευμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων πολιορκοῦν , καὶ ᾗπερ ὥρμηντο , δι’ ἐκείνου πορευθῆναι πέραν τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου ὡς Φαρνάκην τὸν Φαρναβάζου , ὃς αὐτοὺς ἔμελλεν ὡς βασιλέα ἀναπέμψειν .
At the end of the same summer, Aristeus, a Corinthian, Aneristus, Nicolaus, and Stratodemus, ambassadors of the Lacedaemonians, Timagoras, a Tegean, and Pollis, an Argive in a private capacity, being on their way to Asia, to obtain an interview with the king, if by any means they might prevail on him to supply money and join in the war, went first to Thrace, to Sitalces the son of Teres, wishing to persuade him, if they could, to withdraw from his alliance with the Athenians, and make an expedition against Potidaea, where was an armament of the Athenians besieging the place; and then, to proceed by his assistance to their destination across the Hellespont, to Pharnaces the son of Pharnabazus, who was to send them up the country to the king.

2.67.2
1424
 παρατυχόντες δὲ Ἀθηναίων πρέσβεις Λέαρχος Καλλιμάχου καὶ Ἀμεινιάδης Φιλήμονος παρὰ τῷ Σιτάλκῃ πείθουσι τὸν Σάδοκον τὸν γεγενημένον Ἀθηναῖον , Σιτάλκου υἱόν , τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐγχειρίσαι σφίσιν , ὅπως μὴ διαβάντες ὡς βασιλέα τὴν ἐκείνου πόλιν τὸ μέρος βλάψωσιν .
But some Athenian ambassadors, Learchus son of Callimachus, and Aminiades son of Philemon, happening to be with Sitalces, persuaded Sadocus his son, who had been made an Athenian citizen, to put the men into their hands, that they might not, by passing over to the king, do their best to injure [what was now] his own country.

2.67.3
1425
 ὁ δὲ πεισθεὶς πορευομένους αὐτοὺς διὰ τῆς Θρᾴκης ἐπὶ τὸ πλοῖον ᾧ ἔμελλον τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον περαιώσειν , πρὶν ἐσβαίνειν ξυλλαμβάνει , ἄλλους ξυμπέμψας μετὰ τοῦ Λεάρχου καὶ Ἀμεινιάδου , καὶ ἐκέλευσεν ἐκείνοις παραδοῦναι ·
He, in compliance with their request, having sent some other men with Learchus and Aminiades, seized them as they were travelling through Thrace to the vessel in which they were to cross the Hellespont, before they went on board, and gave orders to deliver them up to the Athenian ambassadors;

2.67.3
1426
 οἱ δὲ λαβόντες ἐκόμισαν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας .
who, having received them, took them to Athens.

2.67.4
1427
 ἀφικομένων δὲ αὐτῶν δείσαντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸν Ἀριστέα μὴ αὖθις σφᾶς ἔτι πλείω κακουργῇ διαφυγών , ὅτι καὶ πρὸ τούτων τὰ τῆς Ποτειδαίας καὶ τῶν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης πάντα ἐφαίνετο πράξας , ἀκρίτους καὶ βουλομένους ἔστιν ἃ εἰπεῖν αὐθημερὸν ἀπέκτειναν πάντας καὶ ἐς φάραγγα ἐσέβαλον , δικαιοῦντες τοῖς αὐτοῖς ἀμύνεσθαι οἷσπερ καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ὑπῆρξαν , τοὺς ἐμπόρους οὓς ἔλαβον Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐν ὁλκάσι περὶ Πελοπόννησον πλέοντας ἀποκτείναντες καὶ ἐς φάραγγας ἐσβαλόντες .
On their arrival the Athenians, being afraid that if Aristeus escaped he might do them still more mischief, (for even before this he had evidently conducted all the measures in Potidaea and their possessions Thrace-ward,) without giving them a trial, though they requested to say something [in their own defence], put them to death that same day, and threw them into pits; thinking it but just to requite them in the same way as the Lacedaemonians had begun with; for they had killed and thrown into pits the merchants, both of the Athenians and their allies, whom they had taken on board trading vessels about the coast of the Peloponnese.

2.67.4
1428
 πάντας γὰρ δὴ κατ’ ἀρχὰς τοῦ πολέμου Λακεδαιμόνιοι ὅσους λάβοιεν ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ὡς πολεμίους διέφθειρον , καὶ τοὺς μετὰ Ἀθηναίων ξυμπολεμοῦντας καὶ τοὺς μηδὲ μεθ’ ἑτέρων .
Indeed all that the Lacedaemonians took on the sea at the beginning of the war, they butchered as enemies, both those who were confederates of the Athenians and those who were neutral.

2.68.1
1429
 κατὰ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους , τοῦ θέρους τελευτῶντος , καὶ Ἀμπρακιῶται αὐτοί τε καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων πολλοὺς ἀναστήσαντες ἐστράτευσαν ἐπ’ Ἄργος τὸ Ἀμφιλοχικὸν καὶ τὴν ἄλλην Ἀμφιλοχίαν .
About the same time, when the summer was drawing to a close, the Ambraciots, with their own forces and many of the barbarians whom they had raised, made an expedition against Argos in Amphilochia, and the rest of that country.

2.68.2
1430
 ἔχθρα δὲ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους ἀπὸ τοῦδε αὐτοῖς ἤρξατο πρῶτον γενέσθαι .
Now their enmity against the Argives first arose from the following circumstances.

2.68.3
1431
 Ἄργος τὸ Ἀμφιλοχικὸν καὶ Ἀμφιλοχίαν τὴν ἄλλην ἔκτισε μὲν μετὰ τὰ Τρωικὰ οἴκαδε ἀναχωρήσας καὶ οὐκ ἀρεσκόμενος τῇ ἐν Ἄργει καταστάσει Ἀμφίλοχος ὁ Ἀμφιάρεω ἐν τῷ Ἀμπρακικῷ κόλπῳ , ὁμώνυμον τῇ ἑαυτοῦ πατρίδι Ἄργος ὀνομάσας ( καὶ ἦν ἡ πόλις αὕτη μεγίστη τῆς Ἀμφιλοχίας καὶ τοὺς δυνατωτάτους εἶχεν οἰκήτορας ) , ὑπὸ ξυμφορῶν δὲ πολλαῖς γενεαῖς ὕστερον πιεζόμενοι Ἀμπρακιώτας ὁμόρους ὄντας τῇ Ἀμφιλοχικῇ ξυνοίκους ἐπηγάγοντο , καὶ ἡλληνίσθησαν τὴν νῦν γλῶσσαν τότε πρῶτον ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀμπρακιωτῶν ξυνοικησάντων ·
Argos in Amphilochia and The rest of the country was colonized by Amphilochus the son of Amphiaraus, when he returned home after the Trojan war, and was not pleased with the state of things at Argos;

2.68.5
1432
 οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι Ἀμφίλοχοι βάρβαροί εἰσιν .
This was the largest city of Amphilochia, and had the most powerful inhabitants. But many generations afterwards, being pressed by misfortunes, they called in the Ambraciots, who bordered on Amphilochia, as joint-inhabitants; and from the Ambraciots who joined them they were taught the Greek language which they now speak, the rest of the Amphilochians being barbarians.

2.68.6
1433
 ἐκβάλλουσιν οὖν τοὺς Ἀργείους οἱ Ἀμπρακιῶται χρόνῳ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἴσχουσι τὴν πόλιν .
Now the Ambraciots in process of time drove out the Argives, and held the city by themselves.

2.68.7
1434
 οἱ δ’ Ἀμφίλοχοι γενομένου τούτου διδόασιν ἑαυτοὺς Ἀκαρνᾶσι , καὶ προσπαρακαλέσαντες ἀμφότεροι Ἀθηναίους , οἳ αὐτοῖς Φορμίωνά τε στρατηγὸν ἔπεμψαν καὶ ναῦς τριάκοντα , ἀφικομένου δὲ τοῦ Φορμίωνος αἱροῦσι κατὰ κράτος Ἄργος καὶ τοὺς Ἀμπρακιώτας ἠνδραπόδισαν , κοινῇ τε ᾤκισαν αὐτὸ Ἀμφίλοχοι καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνες .
Upon this the Amphilochians gave themselves up to the Acarnanians; and both together having called in the Athenians, who sent them Phormio for a general and thirty ships, on the arrival of Phormio they took Argos by storm, and made slaves of the Ambraciots; while the Amphilochians and Acarnanians occupied the town in common.

2.68.8
1435
 μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἡ ξυμμαχία πρῶτον ἐγένετο Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶσιν .
And it was after this event that the alliance between the Athenians and Acarnanians was first made.

2.68.9
1436
 οἱ δὲ Ἀμπρακιῶται τὴν μὲν ἔχθραν ἐς τοὺς Ἀργείους ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνδραποδισμοῦ σφῶν αὐτῶν πρῶτον ἐποιήσαντο , ὕστερον δὲ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τήνδε τὴν στρατείαν ποιοῦνται αὑτῶν τε καὶ Χαόνων καὶ ἄλλων τινῶν τῶν πλησιοχώρων βαρβάρων ·
The Ambraciots then first conceived their enmity to the Argives from this enslavement of their people; and afterwards, during the war, formed this armament from themselves and the Chaonians, and some other of the neighboring barbarians.

2.68.9
1437
 ἐλθόντες τε πρὸς τὸ Ἄργος τῆς μὲν χώρας ἐκράτουν , τὴν δὲ πόλιν ὡς οὐκ ἐδύναντο ἑλεῖν προσβαλόντες , ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου καὶ διελύθησαν κατὰ ἔθνη .
Having come to Argos, they obtained command of the country; but being unable to take the city by assault, they retired homeward, and disbanding returned to their different nations.

2.68.9
1438
 τοσαῦτα μὲν ἐν τῷ θέρει ἐγένετο .
These were the events of the summer.

2.69.1
1439
 τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος Ἀθηναῖοι ναῦς ἔστειλαν εἴκοσι μὲν περὶ Πελοπόννησον καὶ Φορμίωνα στρατηγόν , ὃς ὁρμώμενος ἐκ Ναυπάκτου φυλακὴν εἶχε μήτ’ ἐκπλεῖν ἐκ Κορίνθου καὶ τοῦ Κρισαίου κόλπου μηδένα μήτ’ ἐσπλεῖν , ἑτέρας δὲ ἓξ ἐπὶ Καρίας καὶ Λυκίας καὶ Μελήσανδρον στρατηγόν , ὅπως ταῦτά τε ἀργυρολογῶσι καὶ τὸ λῃστικὸν τῶν Πελοποννησίων μὴ ἐῶσιν αὐτόθεν ὁρμώμενον βλάπτειν τὸν πλοῦν τῶν ὁλκάδων τῶν ἀπὸ Φασήλιδος καὶ Φοινίκης καὶ τῆς ἐκεῖθεν ἠπείρου .
The following winter, the Athenians sent twenty ships round the Peloponnese, with Phormio as commander, who, making Naupactus his station, kept watch that no one either sailed out from Corinth and the Crisaean Bay, or into it. Another squadron of six they sent towards Caria and Lycia, with Melesander as commander, to raise money from those parts, and to hinder the privateers of the Peloponnesians from making that their rendezvous, and interfering with the navigation of the merchantmen from Phaselis and Phoenice, and the continent in that direction.

2.69.2
1440
 ἀναβὰς δὲ στρατιᾷ Ἀθηναίων τε τῶν ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐς τὴν Λυκίαν ὁ Μελήσανδρος ἀποθνῄσκει καὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς μέρος τι διέφθειρε νικηθεὶς μάχῃ .
But Melesander, having gone up the country into Lycia with a force composed of the Athenians from the ships and the allies, and being defeated in a battle, was killed, and lost a considerable part of the army.

2.70.1
1441
 τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος οἱ Ποτειδεᾶται ἐπειδὴ οὐκέτι ἐδύναντο πολιορκούμενοι ἀντέχειν , ἀλλ’ αἵ τε ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐσβολαὶ Πελοποννησίων οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἀπανίστασαν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ὅ τε σῖτος ἐπελελοίπει , καὶ ἄλλα τε πολλὰ ἐπεγεγένητο αὐτόθι ἤδη βρώσεως πέρι ἀναγκαίας καί τινες καὶ ἀλλήλων ἐγέγευντο , οὕτω δὴ λόγους προσφέρουσι περὶ ξυμβάσεως τοῖς στρατηγοῖς τῶν Ἀθηναίων τοῖς ἐπὶ σφίσι τεταγμένοις , Ξενοφῶντί τε τῷ Εὐριπίδου καὶ Ἑστιοδώρῳ τῷ Ἀριστοκλείδου καὶ Φανομάχῳ τῷ Καλλιμάχου .
The same winter, when the Potidaeans could no longer hold out against their besiegers, the inroads of the Peloponnesians into Attica having had no more effect towards causing the Athenians to withdraw, and their provisions being exhausted, and many other horrors having befallen them in their straits for food, and some having even eaten one another; under these circumstances, I say, they make proposals for a capitulation to the generals of the Athenians who were in command against them, Xenophon son of Euripides, Histiodorus son of Aristoclides, and Phanomachus son of Callimachus;

2.70.2
1442
 οἱ δὲ προσεδέξαντο , ὁρῶντες μὲν τῆς στρατιᾶς τὴν ταλαιπωρίαν ἐν χωρίῳ χειμερινῷ , ἀνηλωκυίας δὲ ἤδη τῆς πόλεως δισχίλια τάλαντα ἐς τὴν πολιορκίαν .
who accepted them, seeing the distress of their army in so exposed a position, and the state having already expended 2000 talents on the siege. On these terms therefore they came to an agreement;

2.70.3
1443
 ἐπὶ τοῖσδε οὖν ξυνέβησαν , ἐξελθεῖν αὐτοὺς καὶ παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας καὶ τοὺς ἐπικούρους ξὺν ἑνὶ ἱματίῳ , γυναῖκας δὲ ξὺν δυοῖν , καὶ ἀργύριόν τι ῥητὸν ἔχοντας ἐφόδιον .
that themselves, their children, wives, and auxiliaries, should go out of the place with one dress each-but the women with two-and with a fixed sum of money for their journey.

2.70.4
1444
 καὶ οἱ μὲν ὑπόσπονδοι ἐξῆλθον ἔς τε τὴν Χαλκιδικὴν καὶ ᾗ ἕκαστος ἐδύνατο ·
According to this treaty, they went out to Chalcidice, or where each could:

2.70.4
1445
 Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ τούς τε στρατηγοὺς ἐπῃτιάσαντο ὅτι ἄνευ αὐτῶν ξυνέβησαν ( ἐνόμιζον γὰρ ἂν κρατῆσαι τῆς πόλεως ᾗ ἐβούλοντο ) , καὶ ὕστερον ἐποίκους ἔπεμψαν ἑαυτῶν ἐς τὴν Ποτείδαιαν καὶ κατῴκισαν .
but the Athenians blamed the generals for having come to an agreement without consulting them; for they thought they might have got possession of the place on their own terms; and afterwards they sent settlers of their own to Potidaea and colonized it.

2.70.4
1446
 ταῦτα μὲν ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι ἐγένετο , καὶ τὸ δεύτερον ἔτος ἐτελεύτα τῷ πολέμῳ τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
These were the transactions of the winter; and so ended the second year of this war of which Thucydides wrote the history.

2.71.1
1447
 τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐς μὲν τὴν Ἀττικὴν οὐκ ἐσέβαλον , ἐστράτευσαν δὲ ἐπὶ Πλάταιαν ·
The following summer the Peloponnesians and their allies did not make an incursion into Attica, but marched against Plataea.

2.71.1
1448
 ἡγεῖτο δὲ Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ Ζευξιδάμου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς .
They were led by Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians.

2.71.1
1449
 καὶ καθίσας τὸν στρατὸν ἔμελλε δῃώσειν τὴν γῆν ·
Having encamped his army, he was going to ravage the land;

2.71.1
1450
 οἱ δὲ Πλαταιῆς εὐθὺς πρέσβεις πέμψαντες πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔλεγον τοιάδε ·
but the Plataeans immediately sent ambassadors to him, and spoke as follows:

2.71.2
1451
 &quot; Ἀρχίδαμε καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , οὐ δίκαια ποιεῖτε οὐδ’ ἄξια οὔτε ὑμῶν οὔτε πατέρων ὧν ἐστέ , ἐς γῆν τὴν Πλαταιῶν στρατεύοντες .
"Archidamus and Lacedaemonians, you are not doing what is right, or worthy either of yourselves or of the fathers from whom you are sprung, in marching against the territory of the Plataeans.

2.71.2
1452
 Παυσανίας γὰρ ὁ Κλεομβρότου Λακεδαιμόνιος ἐλευθερώσας τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἀπὸ τῶν Μήδων μετὰ Ἑλλήνων τῶν ἐθελησάντων ξυνάρασθαι τὸν κίνδυνον τῆς μάχης ἣ παρ’ ἡμῖν ἐγένετο , θύσας ἐν τῇ Πλαταιῶν ἀγορᾷ ἱερὰ Διὶ ἐλευθερίῳ καὶ ξυγκαλέσας πάντας τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀπεδίδου Πλαταιεῦσι γῆν καὶ πόλιν τὴν σφετέραν ἔχοντας αὐτονόμους οἰκεῖν , στρατεῦσαί τε μηδένα ποτὲ ἀδίκως ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς μηδ’ ἐπὶ δουλείᾳ ·
For Pausanias son of Cleombrotus, the Lacedaemonian, when he had liberated Greece from the Medes, in conjunction with those Greeks who had been willing to incur with him the peril of the battle that was fought near our city, after sacrificing in the market-place of Plataea to Jupiter the Deliverer, and assembling all the allies, proceeded to grant to the Plataeans to live in independent possession of their land and city, and that no one should ever make war upon them unjustly, or to enslave them;

2.71.2
1453
 εἰ δὲ μή , ἀμύνειν τοὺς παρόντας ξυμμάχους κατὰ δύναμιν .
else that the allies then present should assist them to their utmost."

2.71.3
1454
 τάδε μὲν ἡμῖν πατέρες οἱ ὑμέτεροι ἔδοσαν ἀρετῆς ἕνεκα καὶ προθυμίας τῆς ἐν ἐκείνοις τοῖς κινδύνοις γενομένης , ὑμεῖς δὲ τ- ἐναντία δρᾶτε ·
"These rewards your fathers gave us for our valour and zeal, shown in those scenes of danger;

2.71.3
1455
 μετὰ γὰρ Θηβαίων τῶν ἡμῖν ἐχθίστων ἐπὶ δουλείᾳ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ἥκετε .
but you are doing the very contrary; for in conjunction with the Thebans, our bitterest enemies, you are come to enslave us."

2.71.4
1456
 μάρτυρας δὲ θεοὺς τούς τε ὁρκίους τότε γενομένους ποιούμενοι καὶ τοὺς ὑμετέρους πατρῴους καὶ ἡμετέρους ἐγχωρίους , λέγομεν ὑμῖν γῆν τὴν Πλαταιίδα μὴ ἀδικεῖν μηδὲ παραβαίνειν τοὺς ὅρκους , ἐᾶν δὲ οἰκεῖν αὐτονόμους καθάπερ Παυσανίας ἐδικαίωσεν &quot; .
" Calling the gods then to witness, both those who at that time received the oaths, and those of your own fathers, and those of our country, we charge you not to injure the Plataean territory, nor break the oaths, but to let us live independent, as Pausanias thought right to grant us."

2.72.1
1457
 τοσαῦτα εἰπόντων τῶν Πλαταιῶν Ἀρχίδαμος ὑπολαβὼν εἶπεν ·
When the Plataeans had spoken thus much, Archidamus took them up and said:

2.72.1
1458
 &quot; δίκαια λέγετε , ὦ ἄνδρες Πλαταιῆς , ἢν ποιῆτε ὁμοῖα τοῖς λόγοις .
"You speak what is just, Plataeans, if you act in accordance with your speech.

2.72.1
1459
 καθάπερ γὰρ Παυσανίας ὑμῖν παρέδωκεν , αὐτοί τε αὐτονομεῖσθε καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ξυνελευθεροῦτε , ὅσοι μετασχόντες τῶν τότε κινδύνων ὑμῖν τε ξυνώμοσαν καὶ εἰσὶ νῦν ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίοις , παρασκευή τε τοσήδε καὶ πόλεμος γεγένηται αὐτῶν ἕνεκα καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐλευθερώσεως .
As then Pausanias bequeathed to you, so both enjoy independence yourselves, and assist in liberating the rest, as many as shared the dangers of that day, and are now under the rule of the Athenians; and for whose liberation, and that of the rest [of their subjects], all this provision and war has been undertaken.

2.72.1
1460
 ἧς μάλιστα μὲν μετασχόντες καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐμμείνατε τοῖς ὅρκοις ·
Do you then yourselves abide by the oaths, by taking your part in this liberation, if possible;

2.72.1
1461
 εἰ δὲ μή , ἅπερ καὶ πρότερον ἤδη προυκαλεσάμεθα , ἡσυχίαν ἄγετε νεμόμενοι τὰ ὑμέτερα αὐτῶν , καὶ ἔστε μηδὲ μεθ’ ἑτέρων , δέχεσθε δὲ ἀμφοτέρους φίλους , ἐπὶ πολέμῳ δὲ μηδετέρους .
but if not, then, as we before proposed, keep quiet in the enjoyment of your own possessions, and do not join either side, but receive both as friends, and for warlike purposes neither the one nor the other.

2.72.1
1462
 καὶ τάδε ἡμῖν ἀρκέσει &quot; .
And this will satisfy us."

2.72.2
1463
 ὁ μὲν Ἀρχίδαμος τοσαῦτα εἶπεν ·
Thus much said Archidamus.

2.72.2
1464
 οἱ δὲ Πλαταιῶν πρέσβεις ἀκούσαντες ταῦτα ἐσῆλθον ἐς τὴν πόλιν , καὶ τῷ πλήθει τὰ ῥηθέντα κοινώσαντες ἀπεκρίναντο αὐτῷ ὅτι ἀδύνατα σφίσιν εἴη ποιεῖν ἃ προκαλεῖται ἄνευ Ἀθηναίων ( παῖδες γὰρ σφῶν καὶ γυναῖκες παρ’ ἐκείνοις εἶεν ) , δεδιέναι δὲ καὶ περὶ τῇ πάσῃ πόλει μὴ ἐκείνων ἀποχωρησάντων Ἀθηναῖοι ἐλθόντες σφίσιν οὐκ ἐπιτρέπωσιν , ἢ Θηβαῖοι , ὡς ἔνορκοι ὄντες κατὰ τὸ ἀμφοτέρους δέχεσθαι , αὖθις σφῶν τὴν πόλιν πειράσωσι καταλαβεῖν .
The Plataeans having heard it went into the city, and after communicating to the whole people what had been said, answered him, that it was impossible for them to do what he proposed without consulting the Athenians; for their children and wives were with them; and that they had also fears for the whole city, lest when the Lacedaemonians had retired, the Athenians should come and not leave it in their hands; or the Thebans, as being included in the treaty, on the strength of their "receiving both parties," should again endeavour to seize on it.

2.72.3
1465
 ὁ δὲ θαρσύνων αὐτοὺς πρὸς ταῦτα ἔφη ·
To encourage them on these points he said,

2.72.3
1466
 &quot; ὑμεῖς δὲ πόλιν μὲν καὶ οἰκίας ἡμῖν παράδοτε τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις , καὶ γῆς ὅρους ἀποδείξατε καὶ δένδρα ἀριθμῷ τὰ ὑμέτερα καὶ ἄλλο εἴ τι δυνατὸν ἐς ἀριθμὸν ἐλθεῖν ·
"Do you then give up your city and houses to us Lacedaemonians, and point out the boundaries of your territory, and your trees in number, and whatever else can be reduced to number;

2.72.3
1467
 αὐτοὶ δὲ μεταχωρήσατε ὅποι βούλεσθε , ἕως ἂν ὁ πόλεμος ᾖ ·
and yourselves remove wherever you please for as long as the war may last.

2.72.3
1468
 ἐπειδὰν δὲ παρέλθῃ , ἀποδώσομεν ὑμῖν ἃ ἂν παραλάβωμεν .
When it is over, we will restore to you whatever we may have received.

2.72.3
1469
 μέχρι δὲ τοῦδε ἕξομεν παρακαταθήκην , ἐργαζόμενοι καὶ φορὰν φέροντες ἣ ἂν ὑμῖν μέλλῃ ἱκανὴ ἔσεσθαι &quot; .
Till then we will hold it in trust, cultivating it, and bringing to you such of the produce as will be sufficient for you."

2.73.1
1470
 οἱ δ’ ἀκούσαντες ἐσῆλθον αὖθις ἐς τὴν πόλιν , καὶ βουλευσάμενοι μετὰ τοῦ πλήθους ἔλεξαν ὅτι βούλονται ἃ προκαλεῖται Ἀθηναίοις κοινῶσαι πρῶτον , καὶ ἢν πείθωσιν αὐτούς , ποιεῖν ταῦτα ·
When they had heard his proposal, they went again into the city, and after consulting with the people, said that they wished first to communicate to the Athenians what he proposed, and should they gain their consent, then to do so;

2.73.1
1471
 μέχρι δὲ τούτου σπείσασθαι σφίσιν ἐκέλευον καὶ τὴν γῆν μὴ δῃοῦν .
but till that time they begged him to grant them a truce, and not to lay waste the land.

2.73.1
1472
 ὁ δὲ ἡμέρας τε ἐσπείσατο ἐν αἷς εἰκὸς ἦν κομισθῆναι , καὶ τὴν γῆν οὐκ ἔτεμνεν .
So he granted them a truce for the number of days within which it was likely they would return home, and in the mean time did not begin to ravage the land.

2.73.2
1473
 ἐλθόντες δὲ οἱ Πλαταιῆς πρέσβεις ὡς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ βουλευσάμενοι μετ’ αὐτῶν πάλιν ἦλθον ἀπαγγέλλοντες τοῖς ἐν τῇ πόλει τοιάδε ·
The Plataean ambassadors having come to the Athenians and consulted with them, returned with the following message to those in the city:

2.73.3
1474
 &quot; οὔτ’ ἐν τῷ πρὸ τοῦ χρόνῳ , ὦ ἄνδρες Πλαταιῆς , ἀφ’ οὗ ξύμμαχοι ἐγενόμεθα , Ἀθηναῖοί φασιν ἐν οὐδενὶ ὑμᾶς προέσθαι ἀδικουμένους οὔτε νῦν περιόψεσθαι , βοηθήσειν δὲ κατὰ δύναμιν .
"Men of Plataea, the Athenians say, that never in time past, since we became their allies, have they on any occasion deserted us when injured; nor will they neglect us now, but will succour us to the best of their power.

2.73.3
1475
 ἐπισκήπτουσί τε ὑμῖν πρὸς τῶν ὅρκων οὓς οἱ πατέρες ὤμοσαν μηδὲν νεωτερίζειν περὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν &quot; .
And they charge you by the oaths which your fathers swore, to make no innovation in the terms of the alliance."

2.74.1
1476
 τοιαῦτα τῶν πρέσβεων ἀπαγγειλάντων οἱ Πλαταιῆς ἐβουλεύσαντο Ἀθηναίους μὴ προδιδόναι , ἀλλ’ ἀνέχεσθαι καὶ γῆν τεμνομένην , εἰ δεῖ , ὁρῶντας καὶ ἄλλο πάσχοντας ὅτι ἂν ξυμβαίνῃ ·
The ambassadors having delivered this message, they resolved not to prove false to the Athenians, but to endure, if necessary, both to see their land ravaged, and to suffer whatever else might befall them.

2.74.1
1477
 ἐξελθεῖν τε μηδένα ἔτι , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ἀποκρίνασθαι ὅτι ἀδύνατα σφίσι ποιεῖν ἐστὶν ἃ Λακεδαιμόνιοι προκαλοῦνται .
They resolved also that no one should go out again, but that they should reply from the walls, that it was impossible for them to do as the Lacedaemonians proposed.

2.74.2
1478
 ὡς δὲ ἀπεκρίναντο , ἐντεῦθεν δὴ πρῶτον μὲν ἐς ἐπιμαρτυρίαν καὶ θεῶν καὶ ἡρώων τῶν ἐγχωρίων Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ βασιλεὺς κατέστη , λέγων ὧδε ·
When they had given this answer, king Archidamus proceeded in the first place to call to witness the gods and heroes of the country, in these words:

2.74.2
1479
 &quot; θεοὶ ὅσοι γῆν τὴν Πλαταιίδα ἔχετε καὶ ἥρωες , ξυνίστορές ἐστε ὅτι οὔτε τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀδίκως , ἐκλιπόντων δὲ τῶνδε προτέρων τὸ ξυνώμοτον , ἐπὶ γῆν τήνδε ἤλθομεν , ἐν ᾗ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν εὐξάμενοι ὑμῖν Μήδων ἐκράτησαν καὶ παρέσχετε αὐτὴν εὐμενῆ ἐναγωνίσασθαι τοῖς Ἕλλησιν , οὔτε νῦν , ἤν τι ποιῶμεν , ἀδικήσομεν ·
"Ye gods and heroes that dwell in the land of Plataea, bear witness that it was neither unjustly in the first instance, but when these men had first broken the agreement they had sworn to, that we came against this land, in which our fathers prayed to you before they conquered the Medes, and which you rendered an auspicious one for the Greeks to contend in;

2.74.2
1480
 προκαλεσάμενοι γὰρ πολλὰ καὶ εἰκότα οὐ τυγχάνομεν .
nor shall we act unjustly now, whatever we may do; for though we have made many fair proposals, we have not succeeded in gaining their assent.

2.74.2
1481
 ξυγγνώμονες δὲ ἔστε τῆς μὲν ἀδικίας κολάζεσθαι τοῖς ὑπάρχουσι προτέροις , τῆς δὲ τιμωρίας τυγχάνειν τοῖς ἐπιφέρουσι νομίμως &quot; .
Grant then that those may be punished for the wrong who were the first to begin it, and that those may obtain their revenge who are lawfully trying to inflict it."

2.75.1
1482
 τοσαῦτα ἐπιθειάσας καθίστη ἐς πόλεμον τὸν στρατόν , καὶ πρῶτον μὲν περιεσταύρωσαν αὐτοὺς τοῖς δένδρεσιν ἃ ἔκοψαν , τοῦ μηδένα ἐπεξιέναι , ἔπειτα χῶμα ἔχουν πρὸς τὴν πόλιν , ἐλπίζοντες ταχίστην αἵρεσιν ἔσεσθαι αὐτῶν στρατεύματος τοσούτου ἐργαζομένου .
Having thus appealed to the gods, he set his army to the war. In the first place he enclosed them with a palisade, made of the trees which they cut down, that no one might go out of the town any longer.

2.75.2
1483
 ξύλα μὲν οὖν τέμνοντες ἐκ τοῦ Κιθαιρῶνος παρῳκοδόμουν ἑκατέρωθεν , φορμηδὸν ἀντὶ τοίχων τιθέντες , ὅπως μὴ διαχέοιτο ἐπὶ πολὺ τὸ χῶμα ·
Cutting down timber therefore from Cithaeron, they built it up on each side, laying it like lattice-work, to serve as walls, that the mound might not spread over a wide space;

2.75.2
1484
 ἐφόρουν δὲ ὕλην ἐς αὐτὸ καὶ λίθους καὶ γῆν καὶ εἴ τι ἄλλο ἁνύτειν μέλλοι ἐπιβαλλόμενον .
and they carried to it brushwood, and stone, and soil, and whatever else would help to complete it when thrown on.

2.75.3
1485
 ἡμέρας δὲ ἔχουν † ἑβδομήκοντα † καὶ νύκτας ξυνεχῶς , διῃρημένοι κατ’ ἀναπαύλας , ὥστε τοὺς μὲν φέρειν , τοὺς δὲ ὕπνον τε καὶ σῖτον αἱρεῖσθαι ·
Seventy days and nights continuously they were throwing it up, being divided into relief-parties, so that some should be carrying, while others were taking sleep and refreshment;

2.75.3
1486
 Λακεδαιμονίων τε οἱ ξεναγοὶ ἑκάστης πόλεως ξυνεφεστῶτες ἠνάγκαζον ἐς τὸ ἔργον .
the Lacedaemonian officers who shared the command over the contingents of each state urging them to the work.

2.75.4
1487
 οἱ δὲ Πλαταιῆς ὁρῶντες τὸ χῶμα αἰρόμενον , ξύλινον τεῖχος ξυνθέντες καὶ ἐπιστήσαντες τῷ ἑαυτῶν τείχει ᾗ προσεχοῦτο , ἐσῳκοδόμουν ἐς αὐτὸ πλίνθους ἐκ τῶν ἐγγὺς οἰκιῶν καθαιροῦντες .
But the Plataeans, seeing the mound rising, put together a wooden wall, and placed it on the wall of their city, where the mound was being made, and built bricks inside it, which they took from the neighbouring houses.

2.75.5
1488
 ξύνδεσμος δ’ ἦν αὐτοῖς τὰ ξύλα , τοῦ μὴ ὑψηλὸν γιγνόμενον ἀσθενὲς εἶναι τὸ οἰκοδόμημα , καὶ προκαλύμματα εἶχε δέρσεις καὶ διφθέρας , ὥστε τοὺς ἐργαζομένους καὶ τὰ ξύλα μήτε πυρφόροις οἰστοῖς βάλλεσθαι ἐν ἀσφαλείᾳ τε εἶναι .
The timbers served as a frame for them, to prevent the building from being weak as it became high; and for curtains it had skins and hides, so that the workmen and the timbers were not exposed to fiery missiles, but were in safety.

2.75.6
1489
 ᾔρετο δὲ τὸ ὕψος τοῦ τείχους μέγα , καὶ τὸ χῶμα οὐ σχολαίτερον ἀντανῄει αὐτῷ .
So the wall was raised to a great height, and the mound rose opposite to it no less quickly.

2.75.6
1490
 καὶ οἱ Πλαταιῆς τοιόνδε τι ἐπινοοῦσιν ·
The Plataeans also adopted some such device as follows:

2.75.6
1491
 διελόντες τοῦ τείχους ᾗ προσέπιπτε τὸ χῶμα ἐσεφόρουν τὴν γῆν .
they took down a part of the wall, where the mound lay against it, and carried the earth into the city.

2.76.1
1492
 οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι αἰσθόμενοι ἐν ταρσοῖς καλάμου πηλὸν ἐνίλλοντες ἐσέβαλλον ἐς τὸ διῃρημένον , ὅπως μὴ διαχεόμενον ὥσπερ ἡ γῆ φοροῖτο .
The Peloponnesians, on perceiving this, rammed down clay in wattles of reed, and threw it into the breach, that it might not be loose, and so carried away like the soil.

2.76.2
1493
 οἱ δὲ ταύτῃ ἀποκλῃόμενοι τοῦτο μὲν ἐπέσχον , ὑπόνομον δὲ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὀρύξαντες καὶ ξυντεκμηράμενοι ὑπὸ τὸ χῶμα ὑφεῖλκον αὖθις παρὰ σφᾶς τὸν χοῦν ·
Being thus baffled, the Plataeans ceased from this attempt; but having dug a passage under ground from the city, and having guessed their way under the mound, they began again to carry the soil in to them.

2.76.2
1494
 καὶ ἐλάνθανον ἐπὶ πολὺ τοὺς ἔξω , ὥστε ἐπιβάλλοντας ἧσσον ἁνύτειν ὑπαγομένου αὐτοῖς κάτωθεν τοῦ χώματος καὶ ἱζάνοντος αἰεὶ ἐπὶ τὸ κενούμενον .
And for a long time they escaped the observation of the enemy outside; so that though they continued to throw on materials, they were further from finishing it; as their mound was carried away from beneath, and continually sinking down into the vacuum.

2.76.3
1495
 δεδιότες δὲ μὴ οὐδ’ οὕτω δύνωνται ὀλίγοι πρὸς πολλοὺς ἀντέχειν , προσεπεξηῦρον τόδε ·
Fearing, however, that they might not even by this means be able to hold out, so few in numbers against so many, they adopted the following additional contrivance.

2.76.3
1496
 τὸ μὲν μέγα οἰκοδόμημα ἐπαύσαντο ἐργαζόμενοι τὸ κατὰ τὸ χῶμα , ἔνθεν δὲ καὶ ἔνθεν αὐτοῦ ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ τοῦ βραχέος τείχους ἐκ τοῦ ἐντὸς μηνοειδὲς ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἐσῳκοδόμουν , ὅπως , εἰ τὸ μέγα τεῖχος ἁλίσκοιτο , τοῦτ’ ἀντέχοι , καὶ δέοι τοὺς ἐναντίους αὖθις πρὸς αὐτὸ χοῦν καὶ προχωροῦντας ἔσω διπλάσιόν τε πόνον ἔχειν καὶ ἐν ἀμφιβόλῳ μᾶλλον γίγνεσθαι .
They ceased to work at the great building opposite to the mound; but beginning at either end of it, where the wall was of its original height, they built another in the form of a crescent, running inwards into the city; that if the great wall were taken, this might hold out, and their opponents might have to throw up a second mound against it, and as they advanced within, might have double trouble and be more exposed to missiles on both their flanks.

2.76.4
1497
 ἅμα δὲ τῇ χώσει καὶ μηχανὰς προσῆγον οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι τῇ πόλει , μίαν μὲν ἣ τοῦ μεγάλου οἰκοδομήματος κατὰ τὸ χῶμα προσαχθεῖσα ἐπὶ μέγα τε κατέσεισε καὶ τοὺς Πλαταιᾶς ἐφόβησεν , ἄλλας δὲ ἄλλῃ τοῦ τείχους , ἃς βρόχους τε περιβάλλοντες ἀνέκλων οἱ Πλαταιῆς , καὶ δοκοὺς μεγάλας ἀρτήσαντες ἁλύσεσι μακραῖς σιδηραῖς ἀπὸ τῆς τομῆς ἑκατέρωθεν ἀπὸ κεραιῶν δύο ἐπικεκλιμένων καὶ ὑπερτεινουσῶν ὑπὲρ τοῦ τείχους ἀνελκύσαντες ἐγκαρσίας , ὁπότε προσπεσεῖσθαί πῃ μέλλοι ἡ μηχανή , ἀφίεσαν τὴν δοκὸν χαλαραῖς ταῖς ἁλύσεσι καὶ οὐ διὰ χειρὸς ἔχοντες , ἡ δὲ ῥύμῃ ἐμπίπτουσα ἀπεκαύλιζε τὸ προῦχον τῆς ἐμβολῆς .
At the same time that they were raising the mound, the Peloponnesians brought engines also to play upon the city; one of which, being brought up close to the wall, shook down a considerable part of the great building, and terrified the Plataeans. Others were advanced against different parts of the wall; but the Plataeans broke them off by throwing nooses around them. They also suspended great beams by long iron chains from the extremity of two levers, which were laid upon the wall, and stretched out beyond it; and having drawn them up at an angle, whenever the engine was going to fall on any point, by loosing the chains and not holding them tight in hand, they let the beam drop; which, falling on it with great impetus, broke off the head of the battering-ram.

2.77.1
1498
 μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι , ὡς αἵ τε μηχαναὶ οὐδὲν ὠφέλουν καὶ τῷ χώματι τὸ ἀντιτείχισμα ἐγίγνετο , νομίσαντες ἄπορον εἶναι ἀπὸ τῶν παρόντων δεινῶν ἑλεῖν τὴν πόλιν πρὸς τὴν περιτείχισιν παρεσκευάζοντο .
After this, when their engines were of no avail, and the building of the wall was going on in opposition to the mound, the Peloponnesians, thinking it impossible to take the city by their present means of offence, prepared for circumvallating it.

2.77.2
1499
 πρότερον δὲ πυρὶ ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς πειρᾶσαι εἰ δύναιντο πνεύματος γενομένου ἐπιφλέξαι τὴν πόλιν οὖσαν οὐ μεγάλην ·
First however they determined to make an attempt upon it by fire, [and see] whether with the help of a favourable wind they could burn the town, as it was not a large one:

2.77.2
1500
 πᾶσαν γὰρ δὴ ἰδέαν ἐπενόουν , εἴ πως σφίσιν ἄνευ δαπάνης καὶ πολιορκίας προσαχθείη .
for they thought of every possible device, if by any means it might be reduced by them without the expense of a siege.

2.77.3
1501
 φοροῦντες δὲ ὕλης φακέλους παρέβαλον ἀπὸ τοῦ χώματος ἐς τὸ μεταξὺ πρῶτον τοῦ τείχους καὶ τῆς προσχώσεως , ταχὺ δὲ πλήρους γενομένου διὰ πολυχειρίαν ἐπιπαρένησαν καὶ τῆς ἄλλης πόλεως ὅσον ἐδύναντο ἀπὸ τοῦ μετεώρου πλεῖστον ἐπισχεῖν , ἐμβαλόντες δὲ πῦρ ξὺν θείῳ καὶ πίσσῃ ἧψαν τὴν ὕλην .
They took therefore faggots of brushwood, and threw them from the mound; at first into the space between it and the wall, and when that had soon been filled by the many hands at work, they piled them up also as far into the town as they could reach from the height; and then lighted the wood by throwing on it fire with sulphur and pitch.

2.77.4
1502
 καὶ ἐγένετο φλὸξ τοσαύτη ὅσην οὐδείς πω ἔς γε ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον χειροποίητον εἶδεν ·
By this means such a flame was raised as no one had ever yet seen produced by the hand of man;

2.77.4
1503
 ἤδη γὰρ ἐν ὄρεσιν ὕλη τριφθεῖσα ὑπ’ ἀνέμων πρὸς αὑτὴν ἀπὸ τ- αὐτομάτου πῦρ καὶ φλόγα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἀνῆκεν .

2.77.4.1503 [though  conflagrations might have exceeded it;] for ere now the wood of a mountain forest has been known to take fire of itself, and to emit a flame in consequence, through the mutual attrition of the boughs by high winds.

2.77.5
1504
 τοῦτο δὲ μέγα τε ἦν καὶ τοὺς Πλαταιᾶς τ- ἄλλα διαφυγόντας ἐλαχίστου ἐδέησε διαφθεῖραι ·
This fire, however, was a great one, and was within very little of destroying the Plataeans, after they had escaped all their other dangers;

2.77.5
1505
 ἐντὸς γὰρ πολλοῦ χωρίου τῆς πόλεως οὐκ ἦν πελάσαι , πνεῦμά τε εἰ ἐπεγένετο αὐτῇ ἐπίφορον , ὅπερ καὶ ἤλπιζον οἱ ἐναντίοι , οὐκ ἂν διέφυγον .
for there was a considerable part of the town within which it was not possible to approach; and if a wind had risen to blow upon it, as their enemy hoped, they would not have escaped.

2.77.6
1506
 νῦν δὲ καὶ τόδε λέγεται ξυμβῆναι , ὕδωρ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ πολὺ καὶ βροντὰς γενομένας σβέσαι τὴν φλόγα καὶ οὕτω παυσθῆναι τὸν κίνδυνον .
As it was, however, the following occurrence is also said to have favoured them; a heavy rain and thunder-storm came on, and quenched the flame; and so the danger ceased.

2.78.1
1507
 οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐπειδὴ καὶ τούτου διήμαρτον , μέρος μέν τι καταλιπόντες τοῦ στρατοῦ , τὸ δὲ πλέον ἀφέντες περιετείχιζον τὴν πόλιν κύκλῳ , διελόμενοι κατὰ πόλεις τὸ χωρίον ·
When the Peloponnesians had failed in this attempt also, they left behind them a certain part of their force, [having disbanded the rest,] and proceeded to raise a wall of circumvallation round the town, dividing the whole extent amongst the contingents of the different states.

2.78.1
1508
 τάφρος δὲ ἐντός τε ἦν καὶ ἔξωθεν ἐξ ἧς ἐπλινθεύσαντο .
There was a ditch, too, both inside and outside of the lines, from which they made their bricks.

2.78.2
1509
 καὶ ἐπειδὴ πᾶν ἐξείργαστο περὶ ἀρκτούρου ἐπιτολάς , καταλιπόντες φυλακὰς τοῦ ἡμίσεος τείχους ( τὸ δὲ ἥμισυ Βοιωτοὶ ἐφύλασσον ) ἀνεχώρησαν τῷ στρατῷ καὶ διελύθησαν κατὰ πόλεις .
All being finished by about the rising of Arcturus, they left troops to man half the extent of the wall, (the other half being manned by the Boeotians,) and retired with their army, and dispersed to their different cities.

2.78.3
1510
 Πλαταιῆς δὲ παῖδας μὲν καὶ γυναῖκας καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτάτους τε καὶ πλῆθος τὸ ἀχρεῖον τῶν ἀνθρώπων πρότερον ἐκκεκομισμένοι ἦσαν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐπολιορκοῦντο ἐγκαταλελειμμένοι τετρακόσιοι , Ἀθηναίων δὲ ὀγδοήκοντα , γυναῖκες δὲ δέκα καὶ ἑκατὸν σιτοποιοί .
Now the Plataeans had previously carried out of the town to Athens their children, and wives, and oldest men, and the mass of the inhabitants that would be of no service; but the men themselves who were left in the place and stood the siege, amounted to four hundred, with eighty Athenians, and one hundred and ten women to make bread for them.

2.78.4
1511
 τοσοῦτοι ἦσαν οἱ ξύμπαντες ὅτε ἐς τὴν πολιορκίαν καθίσταντο , καὶ ἄλλος οὐδεὶς ἦν ἐν τῷ τείχει οὔτε δοῦλος οὔτ’ ἐλεύθερος .
This was the total number of them when they began to be besieged, and there was no one else within the walls, either bond or free.

2.78.4
1512
 τοιαύτη μὲν ἡ Πλαταιῶν πολιορκία κατεσκευάσθη .
Such was the provision made for the siege of Plataea.

2.79.1
1513
 τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους καὶ ἅμα τῇ τῶν Πλαταιῶν ἐπιστρατείᾳ Ἀθηναῖοι δισχιλίοις ὁπλίταις ἑαυτῶν καὶ ἱππεῦσι διακοσίοις ἐπεστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Χαλκιδέας τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης καὶ Βοττιαίους ἀκμάζοντος τοῦ σίτου ·
The same summer, and at the same time as the expedition was made against the Plataeans, the Athenians marched with two thousand heavy-armed of their own, and two hundred horse, against the Thrace-ward Chalcidians, and the Bottiaeans, when the corn was ripe;

2.79.1
1514
 ἐστρατήγει δὲ Ξενοφῶν ὁ Εὐριπίδου τρίτος αὐτός .
under the command of Xenophon son of Euripides, and two colleagues.

2.79.2
1515
 ἐλθόντες δὲ ὑπὸ Σπάρτωλον τὴν Βοττικὴν τὸν σῖτον διέφθειραν .
On arriving under the walls of Spartolus in Bottiaea, they destroyed the corn;

2.79.2
1516
 ἐδόκει δὲ καὶ προσχωρήσειν ἡ πόλις ὑπό τινων ἔνδοθεν πρασσόντων .
and expected that the town would also surrender to them, through the intrigues of a party within.

2.79.2
1517
 προσπεμψάντων δὲ ἐς Ὄλυνθον τῶν οὐ τ- αὐτὰ βουλομένων ὁπλῖταί τε ἦλθον καὶ στρατιὰ ἐς φυλακήν ·
Those, however, who did not wish this, having sent to Olynthus, a body of heavy-armed and other troops came as a garrison for the place;

2.79.2
1518
 ἧς ἐπεξελθούσης ἐκ τῆς Σπαρτώλου ἐς μάχην καθίστανται οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὑπ’ αὐτῇ τῇ πόλει .
and when they had come out against them from Spartolus, the Athenians were drawn up for battle beneath the town itself.

2.79.3
1519
 καὶ οἱ μὲν ὁπλῖται τῶν Χαλκιδέων καὶ ἐπίκουροί τινες μετ’ αὐτῶν νικῶνται ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ ἀναχωροῦσιν ἐς τὴν Σπάρτωλον , οἱ δὲ ἱππῆς τῶν Χαλκιδέων καὶ ψιλοὶ νικῶσι τοὺς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἱππέας καὶ ψιλούς ·
The heavy-armed of the Chalcidians, and some auxiliaries with them, were defeated by the Athenians, and retired into Spartolus; but the Chalcidian horse and light-armed defeated the horse and light-armed of the Athenians.

2.79.4
1520
 εἶχον δέ τινας οὐ πολλοὺς πελταστὰς ἐκ τῆς Κρουσίδος γῆς καλουμένης .
They had [from the first] some few targeteers from the district of Crusis, as it is called;

2.79.4
1521
 ἄρτι δὲ τῆς μάχης γεγενημένης ἐπιβοηθοῦσιν ἄλλοι πελτασταὶ ἐκ τῆς Ὀλύνθου .
and when the battle had just been fought, others joined them from Olynthus.

2.79.5
1522
 καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Σπαρτώλου ψιλοὶ ὡς εἶδον , θαρσήσαντες τοῖς τε προσγιγνομένοις καὶ ὅτι πρότερον οὐχ ἥσσηντο , ἐπιτίθενται αὖθις μετὰ τῶν Χαλκιδέων ἱππέων καὶ τῶν προσβοηθησάντων τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ·
When the light-armed from Spartolus saw these, being encouraged by the accession to their force, and by the fact that they were not worsted before,

2.79.5
1523
 καὶ ἀναχωροῦσι πρὸς τὰς δύο τάξεις ἃς κατέλιπον παρὰ τοῖς σκευοφόροις .
in conjunction with the Chalcidian horse and the late reinforcement they attacked the Athenians again; who retired to the two divisions they had left with the baggage.

2.79.6
1524
 καὶ ὁπότε μὲν ἐπίοιεν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἐνεδίδοσαν , ἀναχωροῦσι δ’ ἐνέκειντο καὶ ἐσηκόντιζον .
Whenever the Athenians advanced against them, they gave way;

2.79.6
1525
 οἵ τε ἱππῆς τῶν Χαλκιδέων προσιππεύοντες ᾗ δοκοίη προσέβαλλον , καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα φοβήσαντες ἔτρεψαν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ ἐπεδίωξαν ἐπὶ πολύ .
but on their beginning to retreat, they pressed them close, and harassed them with their darts. The cavalry of the Chalcidians also rode up and charged them wherever they pleased;

2.79.7
1526
 καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὴν Ποτείδαιαν καταφεύγουσι , καὶ ὕστερον τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους κομισάμενοι ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἀναχωροῦσι τῷ περιόντι τοῦ στρατοῦ ·
and having struck the greatest panic into them, routed and pursued them to a great distance. The Athenians fled for refuge to Potidaea,

2.79.7
1527
 ἀπέθανον δὲ αὐτῶν τριάκοντα καὶ τετρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ πάντες .
and having subsequently recovered their dead by truce, returned to Athens with the remnant of the army; four hundred and thirty of them having been killed, and all the generals.

2.79.7
1528
 οἱ δὲ Χαλκιδῆς καὶ Βοττιαῖοι τροπαῖόν τε ἔστησαν καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς τοὺς αὑτῶν ἀνελόμενοι διελύθησαν κατὰ πόλεις .
The Chalcidians and Bottiaeans erected a trophy, and after taking up their dead, separated to their different cities.

2.80.1
1529
 τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους , οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον τούτων , Ἀμπρακιῶται καὶ Χάονες βουλόμενοι Ἀκαρνανίαν τὴν πᾶσαν καταστρέψασθαι καὶ Ἀθηναίων ἀποστῆσαι πείθουσι Λακεδαιμονίους ναυτικόν τε παρασκευάσασθαι ἐκ τῆς ξυμμαχίδος καὶ ὁπλίτας χιλίους πέμψαι ἐπ’ Ἀκαρνανίαν , λέγοντες ὅτι , ἢν ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ ἅμα μετὰ σφῶν ἔλθωσιν , ἀδυνάτων ὄντων ξυμβοηθεῖν τῶν ἀπὸ θαλάσσης Ἀκαρνάνων ῥᾳδίως Ἀκαρνανίαν σχόντες καὶ τῆς Ζακύνθου καὶ Κεφαλληνίας κρατήσουσι , καὶ ὁ περίπλους οὐκέτι ἔσοιτο Ἀθηναίοις ὁμοίως περὶ Πελοπόννησον ·
The same summer, not long after these events, the Ambraciots and Chaonians wishing to subdue the whole of Acarnania, and to separate it from its connexion with Athens, persuaded the Lacedaemonians to equip a fleet from their confederacy, and to send one thousand heavy-armed to Acarnania; saying that if they were to join them with both a naval and land force, while the Acarnanians on the coast were unable to succour [their countrymen], after gaining possession of Acarnania, they would easily make themselves masters of Zacynthus and Cephallenia;

2.80.1
1530
 ἐλπίδα δ’ εἶναι καὶ Ναύπακτον λαβεῖν .
and so the Athenians would no longer find the circumnavigation of the Peloponnese what it had hitherto been. They suggested too that there was a hope of taking Naupactus also.

2.80.2
1531
 οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι πεισθέντες Κνῆμον μὲν ναύαρχον ἔτι ὄντα καὶ τοὺς ὁπλίτας ἐπὶ ναυσὶν ὀλίγαις εὐθὺς πέμπουσι , τῷ δὲ ναυτικῷ περιήγγειλαν παρασκευασαμένῳ ὡς τάχιστα πλεῖν ἐς Λευκάδα .
Being thus persuaded, the Lacedaemonians despatched immediately Cnemus, who was still high-admiral, and the heavy-armed on board a few vessels; while they sent round orders for the fleet to prepare as quickly as possible, and sail to Leucas.

2.80.3
1532
 ἦσαν δὲ Κορίνθιοι ξυμπροθυμούμενοι μάλιστα τοῖς Ἀμπρακιώταις ἀποίκοις οὖσιν .
Now the Corinthians were most hearty in the cause of the Ambraciots, who were a colony of theirs;

2.80.3
1533
 καὶ τὸ μὲν ναυτικὸν ἔκ τε Κορίνθου καὶ Σικυῶνος καὶ τῶν ταύτῃ χωρίων ἐν παρασκευῇ ἦν , τὸ δ’ ἐκ Λευκάδος καὶ Ἀνακτορίου καὶ Ἀμπρακίας πρότερον ἀφικόμενον ἐν Λευκάδι περιέμενεν .
and the squadrons from Corinth and Sicyon, and those parts were in preparation; while those from Leucas, Anactorium, and Ambracia had arrived before, and were waiting for them at Leucas.

2.80.4
1534
 Κνῆμος δὲ καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ χίλιοι ὁπλῖται ἐπειδὴ ἐπεραιώθησαν λαθόντες Φορμίωνα , ὃς ἦρχε τῶν εἴκοσι νεῶν τῶν Ἀττικῶν αἳ περὶ Ναύπακτον ἐφρούρουν , εὐθὺς παρεσκευάζοντο τὴν κατὰ γῆν στρατείαν .
In the mean time Cnemus and the one thousand heavy-armed with him had effected a passage unobserved by Phormio, who commanded the twenty Athenian ships that kept guard off Naupactus; and they immediately prepared for the expedition by land. There were with him, of the Greeks, the Ambraciots, Leucadians, Anactorians, and his own force of one thousand Peloponnesians;

2.80.5
1535
 καὶ αὐτῷ παρῆσαν Ἑλλήνων μὲν Ἀμπρακιῶται καὶ Λευκάδιοι καὶ Ἀνακτόριοι καὶ οὓς αὐτὸς ἔχων ἦλθε χίλιοι Πελοποννησίων , βάρβαροι δὲ Χάονες χίλιοι ἀβασίλευτοι , ὧν ἡγοῦντο ἐπετησίῳ προστατείᾳ ἐκ τοῦ ἀρχικοῦ γένους Φώτιος καὶ Νικάνωρ .
of the Greeks, the Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians, and the troops which Cnemus brought with him, a thousand heavy-armed Peloponnesians; of the barbarians, one thousand Chaonians, who were not under kingly government, but who were led by Photys and Nicanor, of the family to which the chieftainship was confined, with a yearly exercise of that power.

2.80.5
1536
 ξυνεστρατεύοντο δὲ μετὰ Χαόνων καὶ Θεσπρωτοὶ ἀβασίλευτοι .
With the Chaonians some Thesprotians also joined the expedition, being [like them] not under kingly government.

2.80.6
1537
 Μολοσσοὺς δὲ ἦγε καὶ Ἀτιντᾶνας Σαβύλινθος ἐπίτροπος ὢν Θάρυπος τοῦ βασιλέως ἔτι παιδὸς ὄντος , καὶ Παραυαίους Ὄροιδος βασιλεύων .
Some Molossians and Atintanians were led by Sabylinthus, as guardian of Tharypus, their king, who was yet a minor;

2.80.6
1538
 Ὀρέσται δὲ χίλιοι , ὧν ἐβασίλευεν Ἀντίοχος , μετὰ Παραυαίων ξυνεστρατεύοντο Ὀροίδῳ Ἀντιόχου ἐπιτρέψαντος .
and some Paravaeans by Oroedus their king. One thousand of the Orestians, of whom Antiochus was king, accompanied the Paravaeans, Oroedus being intrusted with the command of them by that monarch.

2.80.7
1539
 ἔπεμψε δὲ καὶ Περδίκκας κρύφα τῶν Ἀθηναίων χιλίους Μακεδόνων , οἳ ὕστερον ἦλθον .
Perdiccas also, without the knowledge of the Athenians, sent one thousand Macedonians, who arrived too late.

2.80.8
1540
 τούτῳ τῷ στρατῷ ἐπορεύετο Κνῆμος οὐ περιμείνας τὸ ἀπὸ Κορίνθου ναυτικόν , καὶ διὰ τῆς Ἀργείας ἰόντες Λιμναίαν , κώμην ἀτείχιστον , ἐπόρθησαν .
With this force Cnemus commenced his march, without waiting the arrival of the fleet from Corinth:

2.80.8
1541
 ἀφικνοῦνταί τε ἐπὶ Στράτον , πόλιν μεγίστην τῆς Ἀκαρνανίας , νομίζοντες , εἰ ταύτην πρώτην λάβοιεν , ῥᾳδίως σφίσι τ- ἄλλα προσχωρήσειν .
and in their passage through the Argive country they sacked Limnaea, an unfortified village; and then went against Stratus, the capital city of Acarnania, thinking that if they took that first, the other towns would readily surrender to them.

2.81.1
1542
 Ἀκαρνᾶνες δὲ αἰσθόμενοι κατά τε γῆν πολλὴν στρατιὰν ἐσβεβληκυῖαν ἔκ τε θαλάσσης ναυσὶν ἅμα τοὺς πολεμίους παρεσομένους , οὔτε ξυνεβοήθουν ἐφύλασσόν τε τὰ αὑτῶν ἕκαστοι , παρά τε Φορμίωνα ἔπεμπον κελεύοντες ἀμύνειν ·
The Acarnanians, finding that a large army had invaded them by land, and that the enemy would also be upon them with a fleet by sea, did not prepare to make any united resistance, but to defend their own separate possessions;

2.81.1
1543
 ὁ δὲ ἀδύνατος ἔφη εἶναι ναυτικοῦ ἐκ Κορίνθου μέλλοντος ἐκπλεῖν Ναύπακτον ἐρήμην ἀπολιπεῖν .
while they sent to Phormio, and desired him to succour them; who, however, said that it was impossible for him to leave Naupactus unprotected, while a fleet was on the point of sailing out from Corinth.

2.81.2
1544
 οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι τρία τέλη ποιήσαντες σφῶν αὐτῶν ἐχώρουν πρὸς τὴν τῶν Στρατίων πόλιν , ὅπως ἐγγὺς στρατοπεδευσάμενοι , εἰ μὴ λόγοις πείθοιεν , ἔργῳ πειρῷντο τοῦ τείχους .
So the Peloponnesians and their allies, having formed themselves into three divisions, were advancing to the city of Stratus;

2.81.3
1545
 καὶ μέσον μὲν ἔχοντες προσῇσαν Χάονες καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι βάρβαροι , ἐκ δεξιᾶς δ’ αὐτῶν Λευκάδιοι καὶ Ἀνακτόριοι καὶ οἱ μετὰ τούτων , ἐν ἀριστερᾷ δὲ Κνῆμος καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ Ἀμπρακιῶται ·
As they advanced, the Chaonians and the rest of the barbarians occupied the centre; the Leucadians and Anactorians, and those with them, were on their right;

2.81.3
1546
 διεῖχον δὲ πολὺ ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων καὶ ἔστιν ὅτε οὐδὲ ἑωρῶντο .
and Cnemus with the Peloponnesians and Ambraciots on their left: but they were at a considerable distance from each other, and sometimes not even within sight.

2.81.4
1547
 καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἕλληνες τεταγμένοι τε προσῇσαν καὶ διὰ φυλακῆς ἔχοντες , ἕως ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο ἐν ἐπιτηδείῳ ·
The Greeks advanced in good order, and keeping a look-out, until they had encamped in a convenient position;

2.81.4
1548
 οἱ δὲ Χάονες σφίσι τε αὐτοῖς πιστεύοντες καὶ ἀξιούμενοι ὑπὸ τῶν ἐκείνῃ ἠπειρωτῶν μαχιμώτατοι εἶναι οὔτε ἐπέσχον τὸ στρατόπεδον καταλαβεῖν , χωρήσαντές τε ῥύμῃ μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων βαρβάρων ἐνόμισαν αὐτοβοεὶ ἂν τὴν πόλιν ἑλεῖν καὶ αὑτῶν τὸ ἔργον γενέσθαι .
but the Chaonians, confident in themselves, and being reputed by the inhabitants of those parts of the continent to be the most warlike tribe, did not wait to take up their position, but rushing on with the rest of the barbarians thought they should take the town at the first assault, and so the achievement would be all their own.

2.81.5
1549
 γνόντες δ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ Στράτιοι ἔτι προσιόντας καὶ ἡγησάμενοι , μεμονωμένων εἰ κρατήσειαν , οὐκ ἂν ἔτι σφίσι τοὺς Ἕλληνας ὁμοίως προσελθεῖν , προλοχίζουσι δὴ τὰ περὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐνέδραις , καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐγγὺς ἦσαν , ἔκ τε τῆς πόλεως ὁμόσε χωρήσαντες καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐνεδρῶν προσπίπτουσιν .
The Stratians, informed of this while they were yet coming on, and thinking that if they could defeat them while thus by themselves, the Greeks would not attack them with the same eagerness, laid an ambush near the walls; and when they had come near, attacked them in close combat, both from the town and from the ambuscade.

2.81.6
1550
 καὶ ἐς φόβον καταστάντων διαφθείρονταί τε πολλοὶ τῶν Χαόνων , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι βάρβαροι ὡς εἶδον αὐτοὺς ἐνδόντας , οὐκέτι ὑπέμειναν , ἀλλ’ ἐς φυγὴν κατέστησαν .
Being thrown into consternation, great numbers of the Chaonians were slain; and when the rest of the barbarians saw them giving way, they no longer stood their ground, but took to flight.

2.81.7
1551
 τῶν δὲ Ἑλληνικῶν στρατοπέδων οὐδέτερον ᾔσθετο τῆς μάχης διὰ τὸ πολὺ προελθεῖν αὐτοὺς καὶ στρατόπεδον οἰηθῆναι καταληψομένους ἐπείγεσθαι .
Now neither of the Greek divisions was aware of the battle, as their confederates had proceeded far in advance, and had been supposed to be hurrying on to occupy their encampment.

2.81.8
1552
 ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐνέκειντο φεύγοντες οἱ βάρβαροι , ἀνελάμβανόν τε αὐτοὺς καὶ ξυναγαγόντες τὰ στρατόπεδα ἡσύχαζον αὐτοῦ τὴν ἡμέραν , ἐς χεῖρας μὲν οὐκ ἰόντων σφίσι τῶν Στρατίων διὰ τὸ μήπω τοὺς ἄλλους Ἀκαρνᾶνας ξυμβεβοηθηκέναι , ἄπωθεν δὲ σφενδονώντων καὶ ἐς ἀπορίαν καθιστάντων ·
But when the barbarians broke in upon them in their flight, they rallied them; and after uniting their separate divisions, remained there quiet during the day; as the Stratians did not come to close quarters with them, because the rest of the Acarnanians had not arrived to help them; but annoyed them with their slings from a distance, and distressed them,

2.81.8
1553
 οὐ γὰρ ἦν ἄνευ ὅπλων κινηθῆναι .
(for it was impossible for them to stir without their armour,)

2.81.8
1554
 δοκοῦσι δὲ οἱ Ἀκαρνᾶνες κράτιστοι εἶναι τοῦτο ποιεῖν .
the Acarnanians being considered to excel very much in this mode of warfare.

2.82.1
1555
 ἐπειδὴ δὲ νὺξ ἐγένετο , ἀναχωρήσας ὁ Κνῆμος τῇ στρατιᾷ κατὰ τάχος ἐπὶ τὸν Ἄναπον ποταμόν , ὃς ἀπέχει σταδίους ὀγδοήκοντα Στράτου , τούς τε νεκροὺς κομίζεται τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ὑποσπόνδους , καὶ Οἰνιαδῶν ξυμπαραγενομένων κατὰ φιλίαν ἀναχωρεῖ παρ’ αὐτοὺς πρὶν τὴν ξυμβοήθειαν ἐλθεῖν .
When night came on, Cnemus retired as quickly as he could with his army to the river Anapus, which is eighty stades distant from Stratus, and the next day recovered his dead by truce;

2.82.1
1556
 κ- ἐκεῖθεν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀπῆλθον ἕκαστοι .
and the Oeniadae having joined him, on the ground of a friendly connexion, he fell back upon that city before the reinforcements of the enemy had arrived.

2.82.1
1557
 οἱ δὲ Στράτιοι τροπαῖον ἔστησαν τῆς μάχης τῆς πρὸς τοὺς βαρβάρους .
Thence they departed to their respective homes; while the Stratians erected a trophy for the result of their engagement with the barbarians.

2.83.1
1558
 τὸ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Κορίνθου καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων τῶν ἐκ τοῦ Κρισαίου κόλπου ναυτικόν , ὃ ἔδει παραγενέσθαι τῷ Κνήμῳ , ὅπως μὴ ξυμβοηθῶσιν οἱ ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἄνω Ἀκαρνᾶνες , οὐ παραγίγνεται , ἀλλ’ ἠναγκάσθησαν περὶ τὰς αὐτὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἐν Στράτῳ μάχης ναυμαχῆσαι πρὸς Φορμίωνα καὶ τὰς εἴκοσι ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων αἳ ἐφρούρουν ἐν Ναυπάκτῳ .
Now the fleet from Corinth and the rest of the confederates coming from the Crisaean Bay, which ought to have joined Cnemus, in order to prevent the Acarnanians on the coast from succouring their countrymen in the interior, did not do so; but they were compelled, about the same time as the battle was fought at Stratus, to come to an engagement with Phormio and the twenty Athenian vessels that kept guard at Naupactus.

2.83.2
1559
 ὁ γὰρ Φορμίων παραπλέοντας αὐτοὺς ἔξω τοῦ κόλπου ἐτήρει , βουλόμενος ἐν τῇ εὐρυχωρίᾳ ἐπιθέσθαι .
For Phormio kept watching them as they coasted along out of the gulf, wishing to attack them in the open sea.

2.83.3
1560
 οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἔπλεον μὲν οὐχ ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίᾳ , ἀλλὰ στρατιωτικώτερον παρεσκευασμένοι ἐς τὴν Ἀκαρνανίαν καὶ οὐκ ἂν οἰόμενοι πρὸς ἑπτὰ καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς τὰς σφετέρας τολμῆσαι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους εἴκοσι ταῖς ἑαυτῶν ναυμαχίαν ποιήσασθαι ·
But the Corinthians and the allies were not sailing to Acarnania with any intention to fight by sea, but were equipped more for land service, and did not think the Athenians would dare to engage with their twenty ships against their forty-seven.

2.83.3
1561
 ἐπειδὴ μέντοι ἀντιπαραπλέοντάς τε ἑώρων αὐτούς , παρὰ γῆν σφῶν κομιζομένων , καὶ ἐκ Πατρῶν τῆς Ἀχαΐας πρὸς τὴν ἀντιπέρας ἤπειρον διαβάλλοντες ἐπ’ Ἀκαρνανίας κατεῖδον τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἀπὸ τῆς Χαλκίδος καὶ τοῦ Εὐήνου ποταμοῦ προσπλέοντας σφίσι καὶ οὐκ ἔλαθον νυκτὸς ἀφορμισάμενοι , οὕτω δὴ ἀναγκάζονται ναυμαχεῖν κατὰ μέσον τὸν πορθμόν .
When, however, they saw them sailing along opposite to them, as they themselves proceeded along their own coast; and on attempting to cross over from Patrae in Achaia to the mainland opposite, on their way to Acarnania, observed the Athenians sailing against them from Chalcis and the river Evenus; (for they had not escaped their observation when they had endeavoured to bring to secretly during the night;) under these circumstances they were compelled to engage in the mid passage.

2.83.4
1562
 στρατηγοὶ δὲ ἦσαν μὲν καὶ κατὰ πόλεις ἑκάστων οἳ παρεσκευάζοντο , Κορινθίων δὲ Μαχάων καὶ Ἰσοκράτης καὶ Ἀγαθαρχίδας .
They had separate commanders for the contingents of the different states that joined the armament, but those of the Corinthians were Machaon, Isocrates, and Agatharcidas.

2.83.5
1563
 καὶ οἱ μὲν Πελοποννήσιοι ἐτάξαντο κύκλον τῶν νεῶν ὡς μέγιστον οἷοί τ’ ἦσαν μὴ διδόντες διέκπλουν , τὰς πρῴρας μὲν ἔξω , ἔσω δὲ τὰς πρύμνας , καὶ τά τε λεπτὰ πλοῖα ἃ ξυνέπλει ἐντὸς ποιοῦνται καὶ πέντε ναῦς τὰς ἄριστα πλεούσας , ὅπως ἐκπλέοιεν διὰ βραχέος παραγιγνόμενοι , εἴ πῃ προσπίπτοιεν οἱ ἐναντίοι .
And now the Peloponnesians ranged their ships in a circle, as large as they could without leaving any opening, with their prows turned outward and their sterns inward; and placed inside all the small craft that accompanied them, and their five best sailers, to advance out quickly and strengthen any point on which the enemy might make his attack.

2.84.1
1564
 οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι κατὰ μίαν ναῦν τεταγμένοι περιέπλεον αὐτοὺς κύκλῳ καὶ ξυνῆγον ἐς ὀλίγον , ἐν χρῷ αἰεὶ παραπλέοντες καὶ δόκησιν παρέχοντες αὐτίκα ἐμβαλεῖν ·
On the other hand, the Athenians, ranged in a single line, kept sailing round them, and reducing them into a smaller compass;

2.84.1
1565
 προείρητο δ’ αὐτοῖς ὑπὸ Φορμίωνος μὴ ἐπιχειρεῖν πρὶν ἂν αὐτὸς σημήνῃ .
continually brushing past them, and making demonstrations of an immediate onset; though they had previously been commanded by Phormio not to attack them till he himself gave the signal.

2.84.2
1566
 ἤλπιζε γὰρ αὐτῶν οὐ μενεῖν τὴν τάξιν , ὥσπερ ἐν γῇ πεζήν , ἀλλὰ ξυμπεσεῖσθαι πρὸς ἀλλήλας τὰς ναῦς καὶ τὰ πλοῖα ταραχὴν παρέξειν , εἴ τ’ ἐκπνεύσειεν ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου τὸ πνεῦμα , ὅπερ ἀναμένων τε περιέπλει καὶ εἰώθει γίγνεσθαι ἐπὶ τὴν ἕω , οὐδένα χρόνον ἡσυχάσειν αὐτούς ·
For he hoped that their order would not be maintained like that of a land-force on shore, but that the ships would fall foul of each other, and that the other craft would cause confusion;

2.84.2
1567
 καὶ τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν ἐφ’ ἑαυτῷ τε ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι , ὁπόταν βούληται , τῶν νεῶν ἄμεινον πλεουσῶν , καὶ τότε καλλίστην γίγνεσθαι .
and if the wind should blow from the gulf, in expectation of which he was sailing round them, and which usually rose towards morning, that they would not remain steady an instant. He thought too that it rested with him to make the attack, whenever he pleased, as his ships were better sailers [than those opposed to him];

2.84.3
1568
 ὡς δὲ τό τε πνεῦμα κατῄει καὶ αἱ νῆες ἐν ὀλίγῳ ἤδη οὖσαι ὑπ’ ἀμφοτέρων , τοῦ τε ἀνέμου τῶν τε πλοίων , ἅμα προσκειμένων ἐταράσσοντο , καὶ ναῦς τε νηὶ προσέπιπτε καὶ τοῖς κοντοῖς διεωθοῦντο , βοῇ τε χρώμενοι καὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀντιφυλακῇ τε καὶ λοιδορίᾳ οὐδὲν κατήκουον οὔτε τῶν παραγγελλομένων οὔτε τῶν κελευστῶν , καὶ τὰς κώπας ἀδύνατοι ὄντες ἐν κλύδωνι ἀναφέρειν ἄνθρωποι ἄπειροι τοῖς κυβερνήταις ἀπειθεστέρας τὰς ναῦς παρεῖχον , τότε δὴ κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον σημαίνει , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι προσπεσόντες πρῶτον μὲν καταδύουσι τῶν στρατηγίδων νεῶν μίαν , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τὰς ἄλλας ᾗ χωρήσειαν διέφθειρον , καὶ κατέστησαν ἐς ἀλκὴν μὲν μηδένα τρέπεσθαι αὐτῶν ὑπὸ τῆς ταραχῆς , φεύγειν δὲ ἐς Πάτρας καὶ Δύμην τῆς Ἀχαΐας .
and that then would be the best time for making it. So when the wind came down upon them, and their ships, being now brought into a narrow compass, were thrown into confusion by the operation of both causes—the violence of the wind, and the small craft dashing against them—and when ship was falling foul of ship, and the crews were pushing them off with poles, and in their shouting, and trying to keep clear, and abusing each other, did not hear a word either of their orders or the boatswains' directions; while, through inexperience, they could not lift their oars in the swell of the sea, and so rendered the vessels less obedient to the helmsmen; just then, at that favourable moment, he gave the signal. And the Athenians attacked them, and first of all sunk one of the admiral-ships, then destroyed all wherever they went, and reduced them to such a condition, that owing to their confusion none of them thought of resistance, but they fled to Patrae and Dyme, in Achaia.

2.84.4
1569
 οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι καταδιώξαντες καὶ ναῦς δώδεκα λαβόντες τούς τε ἄνδρας ἐξ αὐτῶν τοὺς πλείστους ἀνελόμενοι ἐς Μολύκρειον ἀπέπλεον , καὶ τροπαῖον στήσαντες ἐπὶ τῷ Ῥίῳ καὶ ναῦν ἀναθέντες τῷ Ποσειδῶνι ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς Ναύπακτον .
The Athenians having closely pursued them, and taken twelve ships, picking up most of the men from them, and putting them on board their own vessels, sailed off to Molycrium;

2.84.5
1570
 παρέπλευσαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι εὐθὺς ταῖς περιλοίποις τῶν νεῶν ἐκ τῆς Δύμης καὶ Πατρῶν ἐς Κυλλήνην τὸ Ἠλείων ἐπίνειον ·
The Peloponnesians also immediately coasted along with their remaining ships from Dyme and Patrae to Cyllene, the arsenal of the Eleans;

2.84.5
1571
 καὶ ἀπὸ Λευκάδος Κνῆμος καὶ αἱ ἐκείνων νῆες , ἃς ἔδει ταύταις ξυμμεῖξαι , ἀφικνοῦνται μετὰ τὴν ἐν Στράτῳ μάχην ἐς τὴν Κυλλήνην .
and Cnemus and the ships that were at Leucas, which were to have formed a junction with these, came thence, after the battle at Stratus, to the same port.

2.85.1
1572
 πέμπουσι δὲ καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τῷ Κνήμῳ ξυμβούλους ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς Τιμοκράτη καὶ Βρασίδαν καὶ Λυκόφρονα , κελεύοντες ἄλλην ναυμαχίαν βελτίω παρασκευάζεσθαι καὶ μὴ ὑπ’ ὀλίγων νεῶν εἴργεσθαι τῆς θαλάσσης .
Then the Lacedaemonians sent to the fleet, as counsellors to Cnemus, Timocrates, Brasidas, and Lycophron; commanding him to make preparations for a second engagement more successful than the former, and not to be driven off the sea by a few ships. For the result appeared very different from what they might have expected;

2.85.2
1573
 ἐδόκει γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἄλλως τε καὶ πρῶτον ναυμαχίας πειρασαμένοις πολὺς ὁ παράλογος εἶναι , καὶ οὐ τοσούτῳ ᾤοντο σφῶν τὸ ναυτικὸν λείπεσθαι , γεγενῆσθαι δέ τινα μαλακίαν , οὐκ ἀντιτιθέντες τὴν Ἀθηναίων ἐκ πολλοῦ ἐμπειρίαν τῆς σφετέρας δι’ ὀλίγου μελέτης .
(particularly as it was the first sea-fight they had attempted;) and they thought that it was not so much their fleet that was inferior, but that there had been some cowardice [on the part of the admiral]; for they did not weigh the long experience of the Athenians against their own short practice of naval matters.

2.85.2
1574
 ὀργῇ οὖν ἀπέστελλον .
They despatched them therefore in anger;

2.85.3
1575
 οἱ δὲ ἀφικόμενοι μετὰ τοῦ Κνήμου ναῦς τε προσπεριήγγειλαν κατὰ πόλεις καὶ τὰς προϋπαρχούσας ἐξηρτύοντο ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίαν .
and on their arrival they sent round, in conjunction with Cnemus, orders for ships to be furnished by the different states, while they refitted those they already had, with a view to an engagement.

2.85.4
1576
 πέμπει δὲ καὶ ὁ Φορμίων ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας τήν τε παρασκευὴν αὐτῶν ἀγγελοῦντας καὶ περὶ τῆς ναυμαχίας ἣν ἐνίκησαν φράσοντας , καὶ κελεύων αὑτῷ ναῦς ὅτι πλείστας διὰ τάχους ἀποστεῖλαι , ὡς καθ’ ἡμέραν ἑκάστην ἐλπίδος οὔσης αἰεὶ ναυμαχήσειν .
Phormio too, on the other hand, sent messengers to Athens to acquaint them with their preparations, and to tell them of the victory they had [themselves] gained; at the same time desiring them to send him quickly the largest possible number of ships, for lie was in daily expectation of an immediate engagement. They despatched to him twenty;

2.85.5
1577
 οἱ δὲ ἀποπέμπουσιν εἴκοσι ναῦς αὐτῷ , τῷ δὲ κομίζοντι αὐτὰς προσεπέστειλαν ἐς Κρήτην πρῶτον ἀφικέσθαι .
but gave additional orders to the commander of them to go first to Crete.

2.85.5
1578
 Νικίας γὰρ Κρὴς Γορτύνιος πρόξενος ὢν πείθει αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ Κυδωνίαν πλεῦσαι , φάσκων προσποιήσειν αὐτὴν οὖσαν πολεμίαν ·
For Nicias, a Cretan of Gortys, who was there persuaded them to sail against Cydonia, telling them that he would reduce it under their power; for it was at present hostile to them.

2.85.5
1579
 ἐπῆγε δὲ Πολιχνίταις χαριζόμενος ὁμόροις τῶν Κυδωνιατῶν .
His object, however, in calling them in was, that he might oblige the Polichnitae, who bordered on the Cydonians.

2.85.6
1580
 καὶ ὁ μὲν λαβὼν τὰς ναῦς ᾤχετο ἐς Κρήτην , καὶ μετὰ τῶν Πολιχνιτῶν ἐδῄου τὴν γῆν τῶν Κυδωνιατῶν , καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνέμων καὶ ἀπλοίας ἐνδιέτριψεν οὐκ ὀλίγον χρόνον ·
The commander therefore of the squadron went with it to Crete, and in conjunction with the Polichnitae laid waste the territory of the Cydonians; and wasted no little time in the country, owing to adverse winds and the impossibility of putting to sea.

2.86.1
1581
 οἱ δ’ ἐν τῇ Κυλλήνῃ Πελοποννήσιοι , ἐν τούτῳ ἐν ᾧ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι περὶ Κρήτην κατείχοντο , παρεσκευασμένοι ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίαν παρέπλευσαν ἐς Πάνορμον τὸν Ἀχαϊκόν , οὗπερ αὐτοῖς ὁ κατὰ γῆν στρατὸς τῶν Πελοποννησίων προσεβεβοηθήκει .
During the time that the Athenians were thus detained on the coast of Crete, the Peloponnesians at Cyllene, having made their preparations for an engagement, coasted along to Panormus in Achaea, where the land-force of the Peloponnesians had come to support them.

2.86.2
1582
 παρέπλευσε δὲ καὶ ὁ Φορμίων ἐπὶ τὸ Ῥίον τὸ Μολυκρικὸν καὶ ὡρμίσατο ἔξω αὐτοῦ ναυσὶν εἴκοσιν , αἷσπερ καὶ ἐναυμάχησεν .
Phormio, too, coasted along to the Rhium near Molycrium, and dropped anchor outside of it, with twenty ships, the same as he had before fought with.

2.86.3
1583
 ἦν δὲ τοῦτο μὲν τὸ Ῥίον φίλιον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , τὸ δ’ ἕτερον Ῥίον ἐστὶν ἀντιπέρας , τὸ ἐν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ ·
This Rhium was friendly to the Athenians; the other, namely, that in the Peloponnese, is opposite to it;

2.86.3
1584
 διέχετον δὲ ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων σταδίους μάλιστα ἑπτὰ τῆς θαλάσσης , τοῦ δὲ Κρισαίου κόλπου στόμα τοῦτό ἐστιν .
the distance between the two being about seven stades of sea, which forms the mouth of the Crisaean Gulf.

2.86.4
1585
 ἐπὶ οὖν τῷ Ῥίῳ τῷ Ἀχαϊκῷ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι , ἀπέχοντι οὐ πολὺ τοῦ Πανόρμου , ἐν ᾧ αὐτοῖς ὁ πεζὸς ἦν , ὡρμίσαντο καὶ αὐτοὶ ναυσὶν ἑπτὰ καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα , ἐπειδὴ καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους εἶδον .
At the Rhium in Achaea, then, being not far from Panormus, where their land-force was, the Peloponnesians also came to anchor with seventy-seven ships, when they saw that the Athenians had done the same.

2.86.5
1586
 καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν ἓξ ἢ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἀνθώρμουν ἀλλήλοις μελετῶντές τε καὶ παρασκευαζόμενοι τὴν ναυμαχίαν , γνώμην ἔχοντες οἱ μὲν μὴ ἐκπλεῖν ἔξω τῶν Ῥίων ἐς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν , φοβούμενοι τὸ πρότερον πάθος , οἱ δὲ μὴ ἐσπλεῖν ἐς τὰ στενά , νομίζοντες πρὸς ἐκείνων εἶναι τὴν ἐν ὀλίγῳ ναυμαχίαν .
And for six or seven days they lay opposite each other, practising and preparing for the battle; the Peloponnesians intending not to sail beyond the Rhia into the open sea, for they were afraid of a disaster like the former; the Athenians, not to sail into the straits, for they bought that fighting in a confined space was in favour of the enemy.

2.86.6
1587
 ἔπειτα ὁ Κνῆμος καὶ ὁ Βρασίδας καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι τῶν Πελοποννησίων στρατηγοί , βουλόμενοι ἐν τάχει τὴν ναυμαχίαν ποιῆσαι πρίν τι καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπιβοηθῆσαι , ξυνεκάλεσαν τοὺς στρατιώτας πρῶτον , καὶ ὁρῶντες αὐτῶν τοὺς πολλοὺς διὰ τὴν προτέραν ἧσσαν φοβουμένους καὶ οὐ προθύμους ὄντας παρεκελεύσαντο καὶ ἔλεξαν τοιάδε .
Afterwards Cnemus, and Brasidas, and the other Peloponnesian commanders, wishing to bring on the engagement as quickly as they could, before any reinforcement came from Athens, assembled the men first; and seeing the greater part of them frightened in consequence of their former defeat, and not eager for the battle, they cheered them by speaking as follows:

2.87.1
1588
 &quot; ἡ μὲν γενομένη ναυμαχία , ὦ ἄνδρες Πελοποννήσιοι , εἴ τις ἄρα δι’ αὐτὴν ὑμῶν φοβεῖται τὴν μέλλουσαν , οὐχὶ δικαίαν ἔχει τέκμαρσιν τὸ ἐκφοβῆσαι .
" The late sea-fight, Peloponnesians, if owing to it any one be afraid of this before us, affords no just grounds for his alarm. For it was deficient, as you know, in preparation;"

2.87.2
1589
 τῇ τε γὰρ παρασκευῇ ἐνδεὴς ἐγένετο , ὥσπερ ἴστε , καὶ οὐχὶ ἐς ναυμαχίαν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐπὶ στρατείαν ἐπλέομεν ·
and we were sailing not so much for a naval engagement as for a land expedition.

2.87.2
1590
 ξυνέβη δὲ καὶ τὰ ἀπὸ τῆς τύχης οὐκ ὀλίγα ἐναντιωθῆναι , καί πού τι καὶ ἡ ἀπειρία πρῶτον ναυμαχοῦντας ἔσφηλεν .
It happened too that not a few of the chances of war were against us; while partly, perhaps, our inexperience caused our failure, as it was our first battle by sea. It was not then through our cowardice that we experienced the defeat;

2.87.3
1591
 ὥστε οὐ κατὰ τὴν ἡμετέραν κακίαν τὸ ἡσσᾶσθαι προσεγένετο , οὐδὲ δίκαιον τῆς γνώμης τὸ μὴ κατὰ κράτος νικηθέν , ἔχον δέ τινα ἐν αὑτῷ ἀντιλογίαν , τῆς γε ξυμφορᾶς τῷ ἀποβάντι ἀμβλύνεσθαι , νομίσαι δὲ ταῖς μὲν τύχαις ἐνδέχεσθαι σφάλλεσθαι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ,ταῖς δὲ γνώμαις τοὺς αὐτοὺς αἰεὶ ὀρθῶς ἀνδρείους εἶναι , καὶ μὴ ἀπειρίαν τοῦ ἀνδρείου παρόντος προβαλλομένους εἰκότως ἂν ἔν τινι κακοὺς γενέσθαι .
" nor is it right that our spirits, which were not crushed by force, but still retain a measure of defiance to the enemy, should lose their edge from the result of that mishap. We should rather think, that men may indeed be overthrown by mere chances, but that in spirit the same men ought always to be brave; and that while their courage remains, they cannot reasonably on any occasion act like cowards under the cloak of inexperience."

2.87.4
1592
 ὑμῶν δὲ οὐδ’ ἡ ἀπειρία τοσοῦτον λείπεται ὅσον τόλμῃ προύχετε ·
In your case, however, you are not so far inferior to the enemy, even through your inexperience,

2.87.4
1593
 τῶνδε δὲ ἡ ἐπιστήμη , ἣν μάλιστα φοβεῖσθε , ἀνδρείαν μὲν ἔχουσα καὶ μνήμην ἕξει ἐν τῷ δεινῷ ἐπιτελεῖν ἃ ἔμαθεν , ἄνευ δὲ εὐψυχίας οὐδεμία τέχνη πρὸς τοὺς κινδύνους ἰσχύει .
as you are superior to him in daring. As for their skill, of which you are most afraid, if indeed it be joined with courage, it will also be accompanied with presence of mind in danger to execute what it has learned; but without gallantry no art whatever is of any avail in the face of perils.

2.87.4
1594
 φόβος γὰρ μνήμην ἐκπλήσσει , τέχνη δὲ ἄνευ ἀλκῆς οὐδὲν ὠφελεῖ .
For fear banishes presence of mind; and art without bravery is good for nothing.

2.87.5
1595
 πρὸς μὲν οὖν τὸ ἐμπειρότερον αὐτῶν τὸ τολμηρότερον ἀντιτάξασθε , πρὸς δὲ τὸ διὰ τὴν ἧσσαν δεδιέναι τὸ ἀπαράσκευοι τότε τυχεῖν .
" Against their greater experience then put your own greater daring; against your fear in consequence of your defeat put the fact of your having then been unprepared;"

2.87.6
1596
 περιγίγνεται δὲ ὑμῖν πλῆθός τε νεῶν καὶ πρὸς τῇ γῇ οἰκείᾳ οὔσῃ ὁπλιτῶν παρόντων ναυμαχεῖν ·
and there is in your favour a clear balance of superior numbers, and of engaging off your own coast in the presence of your heavy-armed;

2.87.6
1597
 τὰ δὲ πολλὰ τῶν πλεόνων καὶ ἄμεινον παρεσκευασμένων τὸ κράτος ἐστίν .
and victory, generally speaking, declares for those who are the more numerous and better appointed.

2.87.7
1598
 ὥστε οὐδὲ καθ’ ἓν εὑρίσκομεν εἰκότως ἂν ἡμᾶς σφαλλομένους ·
On no one single ground then do we find it probable that we should be defeated.

2.87.7
1599
 καὶ ὅσα ἡμάρτομεν πρότερον , νῦν αὐτὰ ταῦτα προσγενόμενα διδασκαλίαν παρέξει .
As for the blunders we committed before, the very fact of their having been committed will now teach us a lesson.

2.87.8
1600
 θαρσοῦντες οὖν καὶ κυβερνῆται καὶ ναῦται τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἕκαστος ἕπεσθε , χώραν μὴ προλείποντες ᾗ ἄν τις προσταχθῇ .
" With good courage, therefore, both steersmen and sailors, do every man your own duty, without leaving the post assigned to each."

2.87.9
1601
 τῶν δὲ πρότερον ἡγεμόνων οὐ χεῖρον τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν ἡμεῖς παρασκευάσομεν , καὶ οὐκ ἐνδώσομεν πρόφασιν οὐδενὶ κακῷ γενέσθαι ·
And we will prepare for the engagement not worse than your former commanders;

2.87.9
1602
 ἢν δέ τις ἄρα καὶ βουληθῇ , κολασθήσεται τῇ πρεπούσῃ ζημίᾳ , οἱ δὲ ἀγαθοὶ τιμήσονται τοῖς προσήκουσιν ἄθλοις τῆς ἀρετῆς &quot; .
and will give no one any excuse for being a coward: but if any one should wish to be one, he shall be visited with the punishment he deserves; while the brave shall be honoured with the rewards befitting their bravery."

2.88.1
1603
 τοιαῦτα μὲν τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις οἱ ἄρχοντες παρεκελεύσαντο .
Such was the exhortation given to the Peloponnesians by their commanders.

2.88.1
1604
 ὁ δὲ Φορμίων δεδιὼς καὶ αὐτὸς τὴν τῶν στρατιωτῶν ὀρρωδίαν καὶ αἰσθόμενος ὅτι τὸ πλῆθος τῶν νεῶν κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ξυνιστάμενοι ἐφοβοῦντο , ἐβούλετο ξυγκαλέσας θαρσῦναί τε καὶ παραίνεσιν ἐν τῷ παρόντι ποιήσασθαι .
Phormio, on the other hand, being also alarmed at the apprehensions of his men, and perceiving that they formed in groups amongst themselves, and showed their fears of the superior numbers of the ships opposed to them, wished to assemble and cheer them, and offer them some advice at the present juncture.

2.88.2
1605
 πρότερον μὲν γὰρ αἰεὶ αὐτοῖς ἔλεγε καὶ προπαρεσκεύαζε τὰς γνώμας ὡς οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς πλῆθος νεῶν τοσοῦτον , ἢν ἐπιπλέῃ , ὅτι οὐχ ὑπομενετέον ἐστί , καὶ οἱ στρατιῶται ἐκ πολλοῦ ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς τὴν ἀξίωσιν ταύτην εἰλήφεσαν , μηδένα ὄχλον Ἀθηναῖοι ὄντες Πελοποννησίων νεῶν ὑποχωρεῖν ·
For before this he always used to tell them, and prepare their minds for the conviction, that there was no number of ships whatever so great that they ought not to face it, if it sailed against them; and his men had for a long time entertained this resolution, that from no multitude of Peloponnesian ships whatever would they, Athenians as they were, retire.

2.88.3
1606
 τότε δὲ πρὸς τὴν παροῦσαν ὄψιν ὁρῶν αὐτοὺς ἀθυμοῦντας ἐβούλετο ὑπόμνησιν ποιήσασθαι τοῦ θαρσεῖν , καὶ ξυγκαλέσας τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
Seeing them, however, at that time out of spirits, he wished to remind them of their former confidence, and therefore called them together, and addressed them as follows:

2.89.1
1607
 &quot; ὁρῶν ὑμᾶς , ὦ ἄνδρες στρατιῶται , πεφοβημένους τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἐναντίων ξυνεκάλεσα , οὐκ ἀξιῶν τὰ μὴ δεινὰ ἐν ὀρρωδίᾳ ἔχειν .
" Seeing you, my men, alarmed at the numbers of your opponents, I have called you together; as I do not wish you to be in dread of what is not really to be feared."

2.89.2
1608
 οὗτοι γὰρ πρῶτον μὲν διὰ τὸ προνενικῆσθαι καὶ μηδ’ αὐτοὶ οἴεσθαι ὁμοῖοι ἡμῖν εἶναι τὸ πλῆθος τῶν νεῶν καὶ οὐκ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου παρεσκευάσαντο ·
For these men, in the first place, because they have been previously conquered by us, and do not even themselves think that they are a match for us, have equipped this great number of ships, and not such as would be merely equal to ours.

2.89.2
1609
 ἔπειτα ᾧ μάλιστα πιστεύοντες προσέρχονται , ὡς προσῆκον σφίσιν ἀνδρείοις εἶναι , οὐ δι’ ἄλλο τι θαρσοῦσιν ἢ διὰ τὴν ἐν τῷ πεζῷ ἐμπειρίαν τὰ πλείω κατορθοῦντες , καὶ οἴονται σφίσι καὶ ἐν τῷ ναυτικῷ ποιήσειν τὸ αὐτό .
Then, for the fact on which they chiefly rely in coming against us—that it is their natural character to be courageous—they feel this confidence for no other reason than because they are generally successful owing to their experience in land-service;"

2.89.3
1610
 τὸ δ’ ἐκ τοῦ δικαίου ἡμῖν μᾶλλον νῦν περιέσται , εἴπερ καὶ τούτοις ἐν ἐκείνῳ , ἐπεὶ εὐψυχίᾳ γε οὐδὲν προφέρουσι , τῷ δὲ ἑκάτεροί τι εἶναι ἐμπειρότεροι θρασύτεροί ἐσμεν .
" and they think it will do the same for them at sea. But this, in all reason, will rather be our advantage now, as it is theirs in that case: for in valour they are not at all superior to us;"

2.89.4
1611
 Λακεδαιμόνιοί τε ἡγούμενοι αὐτῶν διὰ τὴν σφετέραν δόξαν ἄκοντας προσάγουσι τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐς τὸν κίνδυνον , ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἄν ποτε ἐνεχείρησαν ἡσσηθέντες παρὰ πολὺ αὖθις ναυμαχεῖν .
" but from our being respectively more experienced in one particular service, we are also more confident respecting it. Moreover, the Lacedaemonians lead their allies from regard to their own glory, and bring the greater part of them into dangers against their will;"

2.89.5
1612
 μὴ δὴ αὐτῶν τὴν τόλμαν δείσητε .
Do not then be afraid of their boldness.

2.89.5
1613
 πολὺ δὲ ὑμεῖς ἐκείνοις πλείω φόβον παρέχετε καὶ πιστότερον κατά τε τὸ προνενικηκέναι καὶ ὅτι οὐκ ἂν ἡγοῦνται μὴ μέλλοντάς τι ἄξιον τοῦ παρὰ πολὺ πράξειν ἀνθίστασθαι ὑμᾶς .
It is you that cause them a much greater and better-founded alarm, both on the ground of your having previously conquered them, and because they think we should not have faced them if we did not mean to do something worthy of our previous victory."

2.89.6
1614
 ἀντίπαλοι μὲν γὰρ οἱ πλείους , ὥσπερ οὗτοι , τῇ δυνάμει τὸ πλέον πίσυνοι ἢ τῇ γνώμῃ ἐπέρχονται ·
For when equal to their opponents, men generally come against them, as these do, trusting to their power rather than to their spirit;

2.89.6
1615
 οἱ δὲ ἐκ πολλῷ ὑποδεεστέρων , καὶ ἅμα οὐκ ἀναγκαζόμενοι , μέγα τι τῆς διανοίας τὸ βέβαιον ἔχοντες ἀντιτολμῶσιν .
but those who dare to meet them with far inferior resources, and yet without being compelled, do so because they have the strong assurance of their own resolution.

2.89.6
1616
 ἃ λογιζόμενοι οὗτοι τῷ οὐκ εἰκότι πλέον πεφόβηνται ἡμᾶς ἢ τῇ κατὰ λόγον παρασκευῇ .
From this consideration these men fear us more for the inequality of our preparations, than they would have done for more proportionate ones.

2.89.7
1617
 πολλὰ δὲ καὶ στρατόπεδα ἤδη ἔπεσεν ὑπ’ ἐλασσόνων τῇ ἀπειρίᾳ , ἔστι δὲ ἃ καὶ τῇ ἀτολμίᾳ ·
Many armies, too, have ere now been overthrown by an inferior force through want of skill,

2.89.7
1618
 ὧν οὐδετέρου ἡμεῖς νῦν μετέχομεν .
and others through want of daring; with neither of which have we now any thing to do.

2.89.8
1619
 τὸν δὲ ἀγῶνα οὐκ ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ ἑκὼν εἶναι ποιήσομαι οὐδ’ ἐσπλεύσομαι ἐς αὐτόν .
As for the battle, I will not, if I can help, fight it in the strait;

2.89.8
1620
 ὁρῶ γὰρ ὅτι πρὸς πολλὰς ναῦς ἀνεπιστήμονας ὀλίγαις ναυσὶν ἐμπείροις καὶ ἄμεινον πλεούσαις ἡ στενοχωρία οὐ ξυμφέρει .
nor will I sail in there at all; being aware that for a few skilfully managed and fast-sailing vessels, against a large number unskilfully managed, want of sea-room is a disadvantage.

2.89.8
1621
 οὔτε γὰρ ἂν ἐπιπλεύσειέ τις ὡς χρὴ ἐς ἐμβολήν , μὴ ἔχων τὴν πρόσοψιν τῶν πολεμίων ἐκ πολλοῦ , οὔτ’ ἂν ἀποχωρήσειεν ἐν δέοντι πιεζόμενος ·
For one could neither sail up as he ought to the charge, without having a view of the enemy from a distance; nor retire at the proper time, if hard-pressed;

2.89.8
1622
 διέκπλοι τε οὐκ εἰσὶν οὐδ’ ἀναστροφαί , ἅπερ νεῶν ἄμεινον πλεουσῶν ἔργα ἐστίν , ἀλλὰ ἀνάγκη ἂν εἴη τὴν ναυμαχίαν πεζομαχίαν καθίστασθαι , καὶ ἐν τούτῳ αἱ πλείους νῆες κρείσσους γίγνονται .
and there is no breaking through the line, nor returning to a second charge—which are the manoeuvres of the better-sailing vessels—but the sea-fight must in that case become a land-fight; and then the greater number of ships gain the superiority."

2.89.9
1623
 τούτων μὲν οὖν ἐγὼ ἕξω τὴν πρόνοιαν κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν ·
On these points therefore I will exercise as much forethought as possible;

2.89.9
1624
 ὑμεῖς δὲ εὔτακτοι παρὰ ταῖς ναυσὶ μένοντες τά τε παραγγελλόμενα ὀξέως δέχεσθε , ἄλλως τε καὶ δι’ ὀλίγου τῆς ἐφορμήσεως οὔσης , καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ κόσμον καὶ σιγὴν περὶ πλείστου ἡγεῖσθε , ὃ ἔς τε τὰ πολλὰ τῶν πολεμίων ξυμφέρει καὶ ναυμαχίᾳ οὐχ ἥκιστα , ἀμύνεσθέ τε τούσδε ἀξίως τῶν προειργασμένων .
and do you, remaining in good order in your ships, be quick in receiving the word of command; especially as our post of observation is at so short a distance: and during the action attach the greatest importance to order and silence, which is of service for operations of war in general, and for a naval engagement more particularly: and repel these your enemies in a manner worthy of your former achievements."

2.89.10
1625
 ὁ δὲ ἀγὼν μέγας ὑμῖν , ἢ καταλῦσαι Πελοποννησίων τὴν ἐλπίδα τοῦ ναυτικοῦ ἢ ἐγγυτέρω καταστῆσαι Ἀθηναίοις τὸν φόβον περὶ τῆς θαλάσσης .
" Great indeed is the struggle in which you are engaged, either to destroy the hope of the Peloponnesians as regards their navy, or to bring nearer home to the Athenians apprehensions for the command of the sea."

2.89.11
1626
 ἀναμιμνῄσκω δ’ αὖ ὑμᾶς ὅτι νενικήκατε αὐτῶν τοὺς πολλούς ·
Again I remind you that you have already conquered the greater part of them;

2.89.11
1627
 ἡσσημένων δὲ ἀνδρῶν οὐκ ἐθέλουσιν αἱ γνῶμαι πρὸς τοὺς αὐτοὺς κινδύνους ὁμοῖαι εἶναι &quot; .
and the spirits of defeated men will not be what they were, in the face of the same dangers."

2.90.1
1628
 τοιαῦτα δὲ καὶ ὁ Φορμίων παρεκελεύσατο .
Such was the exhortation that Phormio, on his side, addressed to his men.

2.90.1
1629
 οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι , ἐπειδὴ αὐτοῖς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐκ ἐπέπλεον ἐς τὸν κόλπον καὶ τὰ στενά , βουλόμενοι ἄκοντας ἔσω προαγαγεῖν αὐτούς , ἀναγαγόμενοι ἅμα ἕῳ ἔπλεον , ἐπὶ τεσσάρων ταξάμενοι τὰς ναῦς ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτῶν γῆν , ἔσω ἐπὶ τοῦ κόλπου , δεξιῷ κέρᾳ ἡγουμένῳ , ὥσπερ καὶ ὥρμουν ·
Now when the Athenians did not sail into the narrow part of the gulf to meet them, the Peloponnesians, wishing to lead them on even against their will, weighed in the morning, and having formed their ships in a column four abreast, sailed to their own land towards the inner part of the gulf, with the right wing taking the lead, in which position also they lay at anchor.

2.90.2
1630
 ἐπὶ δ’ αὐτῷ εἴκοσιν ἔταξαν τὰς ἄριστα πλεούσας , ὅπως , εἰ ἄρα νομίσας ἐπὶ τὴν Ναύπακτον αὐτοὺς πλεῖν ὁ Φορμίων καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιβοηθῶν ταύτῃ παραπλέοι , μὴ διαφύγοιεν πλέοντα τὸν ἐπίπλουν σφῶν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔξω τοῦ ἑαυτῶν κέρως , ἀλλ’ αὗται αἱ νῆες περικλῄσειαν .
In this wing they had placed their twenty best sailers; that if Phormio, supposing them to be sailing against Naupactus, should himself also coast along in that direction to relieve the place, the Athenians might not, by getting outside their wing, escape their advance against them, but that these ships might shut them in.

2.90.3
1631
 ὁ δέ , ὅπερ ἐκεῖνοι προσεδέχοντο , φοβηθεὶς περὶ τῷ χωρίῳ ἐρήμῳ ὄντι , ὡς ἑώρα ἀναγομένους αὐτούς , ἄκων καὶ κατὰ σπουδὴν ἐμβιβάσας ἔπλει παρὰ τὴν γῆν ·
As they expected, he was alarmed for the place in its unprotected state; and when he saw them under weigh, against his will, and in great haste too, he embarked his crews and sailed along shore;

2.90.3
1632
 καὶ ὁ πεζὸς ἅμα τῶν Μεσσηνίων παρεβοήθει .
and the infantry of the Messenians marched with him.

2.90.4
1633
 ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι κατὰ μίαν ἐπὶ κέρως παραπλέοντας καὶ ἤδη ὄντας ἐντὸς τοῦ κόλπου τε καὶ πρὸς τῇ γῇ , ὅπερ ἐβούλοντο μάλιστα , ἀπὸ σημείου ἑνὸς ἄφνω ἐπιστρέψαντες τὰς ναῦς μετωπηδὸν ἔπλεον , ὡς εἶχε τάχους ἕκαστος , ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , καὶ ἤλπιζον πάσας τὰς ναῦς ἀπολήψεσθαι .
while the land-forces of the Messenians at the same time came to support him. When the Peloponnesians saw them coasting along in a single file, and already within the gulf and near the shore, (which was just what they wished,) at one signal they suddenly brought their ships round and sailed in a line, as fast as each could, against the Athenians, hoping to cut off all their ships.

2.90.5
1634
 τῶν δὲ ἕνδεκα μέν τινες αἵπερ ἡγοῦντο ὑπεκφεύγουσι τὸ κέρας τῶν Πελοποννησίων καὶ τὴν ἐπιστροφὴν ἐς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν ·
Eleven of them, however, which were taking the lead, escaped the wing of the Peloponnesians and their sudden turn into the open gulf;

2.90.5
1635
 τὰς δ’ ἄλλας ἐπικαταλαβόντες ἐξέωσάν τε πρὸς τὴν γῆν ὑποφευγούσας καὶ διέφθειραν , ἄνδρας τε τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπέκτειναν ὅσοι μὴ ἐξένευσαν αὐτῶν .
but the rest they surprised, and drove them on shore, in their attempt to escape, and destroyed them, killing such of the crews as had not swum out of them.

2.90.6
1636
 καὶ τῶν νεῶν τινὰς ἀναδούμενοι εἷλκον κενάς ( μίαν δὲ αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσιν εἷλον ἤδη ) , τὰς δέ τινας οἱ Μεσσήνιοι παραβοηθήσαντες καὶ ἐπεσβαίνοντες ξὺν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἐς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἐπιβάντες ἀπὸ τῶν καταστρωμάτων μαχόμενοι ἀφείλοντο ἑλκομένας ἤδη .
Some of the ships they lashed to their own and began to tow off empty, and one they took men and all; while in the case of some others, the Messenians, coming to their succour, and dashing into the sea with their armour, and boarding them, fought from the decks, and rescued them when they were already being towed off.

2.91.1
1637
 ταύτῃ μὲν οὖν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐκράτουν τε καὶ διέφθειραν τὰς Ἀττικὰς ναῦς ·
To this extent then the Peloponnesians had the advantage, and destroyed the Athenian ships;

2.91.1
1638
 αἱ δὲ εἴκοσι νῆες αὐτῶν αἱ ἀπὸ τοῦ δεξιοῦ κέρως ἐδίωκον τὰς ἕνδεκα ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων αἵπερ ὑπεξέφυγον τὴν ἐπιστροφὴν ἐς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν .
while their twenty vessels in the right wing were in pursuit of those eleven of the enemy that had just escaped their turn into the open gulf.

2.91.1
1639
 καὶ φθάνουσιν αὐτοὺς πλὴν μιᾶς νεὼς προκαταφυγοῦσαι ἐς τὴν Ναύπακτον , καὶ σχοῦσαι ἀντίπρῳροι κατὰ τὸ Ἀπολλώνιον παρεσκευάζοντο ἀμυνούμενοι , ἢν ἐς τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ σφᾶς πλέωσιν .
They, with the exception of one ship, got the start of them and fled for refuge to Naupactus; and facing about, opposite the temple of Apollo, prepared to defend themselves, in case they should sail to shore against them.

2.91.2
1640
 οἱ δὲ παραγενόμενοι ὕστερον ἐπαιάνιζόν τε ἅμα πλέοντες ὡς νενικηκότες , καὶ τὴν μίαν ναῦν τῶν Ἀθηναίων τὴν ὑπόλοιπον ἐδίωκε Λευκαδία ναῦς μία πολὺ πρὸ τῶν ἄλλων .
Presently they came up, and were singing the paean as they sailed, considering that they had gained the victory; and the one Athenian vessel that had been left behind was chased by a single Leucadian far in advance of the rest.

2.91.3
1641
 ἔτυχε δὲ ὁλκὰς ὁρμοῦσα μετέωρος , περὶ ἣν ἡ Ἀττικὴ ναῦς φθάσασα καὶ περιπλεύσασα τῇ Λευκαδίᾳ διωκούσῃ ἐμβάλλει μέσῃ καὶ καταδύει .
Now there happened to be a merchant-vessel moored out at sea, which the Athenian ship had time to sail round, and struck the Leucadian in pursuit of her amid-ship, and sunk her.

2.91.4
1642
 τοῖς μὲν οὖν Πελοποννησίοις γενομένου τούτου ἀπροσδοκήτου τε καὶ παρὰ λόγον φόβος ἐμπίπτει , καὶ ἅμα ἀτάκτως διώκοντες διὰ τὸ κρατεῖν αἱ μέν τινες τῶν νεῶν καθεῖσαι τὰς κώπας ἐπέστησαν τοῦ πλοῦ , ἀξύμφορον δρῶντες πρὸς τὴν ἐξ ὀλίγου ἀντεφόρμησιν , βουλόμενοι τὰς πλείους περιμεῖναι , αἱ δὲ καὶ ἐς βράχεα ἀπειρίᾳ χωρίων ὤκειλαν .
The Peloponnesians therefore were panic-stricken by this sudden and unlooked for achievement; and moreover, as they were pursuing in disorder, on account of the advantage they had gained, some of the ships dropped their oars, and stopped in their course, from a wish to wait for the rest—doing what was unadvisable, considering that they were observing each other at so short a distance—while others even ran on the shoals, through their ignorance of the localities.

2.92.1
1643
 τοὺς δ’ Ἀθηναίους ἰδόντας ταῦτα γιγνόμενα θάρσος τε ἔλαβε , καὶ ἀπὸ ἑνὸς κελεύσματος ἐμβοήσαντες ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ὥρμησαν .
The Athenians, on seeing this, took courage, and at one word shouted for battle, and rushed upon them.

2.92.1
1644
 οἱ δὲ διὰ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα ἁμαρτήματα καὶ τὴν παροῦσαν ἀταξίαν ὀλίγον μὲν χρόνον ὑπέμειναν , ἔπειτα δὲ ἐτράποντο ἐς τὸν Πάνορμον , ὅθενπερ ἀνηγάγοντο .
In consequence of their previous blunders and their present confusion, they withstood them but a short time, and then fled to Panormus, whence they had put out.

2.92.2
1645
 ἐπιδιώκοντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τάς τε ἐγγὺς οὔσας μάλιστα ναῦς ἔλαβον ἓξ καὶ τὰς ἑαυτῶν ἀφείλοντο , ἃς ἐκεῖνοι πρὸς τῇ γῇ διαφθείραντες τὸ πρῶτον ἀνεδήσαντο ·
The Athenians pursued them closely, and took six of the ships nearest to them, and recovered their own, which the enemy had disabled near the shore and at the beginning of the engagement, and had taken in tow.

2.92.2
1646
 ἄνδρας τε τοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτειναν , τινὰς δὲ καὶ ἐζώγρησαν .
Of the men, they put some to death, and made others prisoners.

2.92.3
1647
 ἐπὶ δὲ τῆς Λευκαδίας νεώς , ἣ περὶ τὴν ὁλκάδα κατέδυ , Τιμοκράτης ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος πλέων , ὡς ἡ ναῦς διεφθείρετο , ἔσφαξεν ἑαυτόν , καὶ ἐξέπεσεν ἐς τὸν Ναυπακτίων λιμένα .
Now on board the Leucadian ship, which went down off the merchant-vessel, was Timocrates the Lacedaemonian; who, when the ship was destroyed, killed himself, and falling overboard was floated into the harbour of Naupactus.

2.92.4
1648
 ἀναχωρήσαντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τροπαῖον ἔστησαν , ὅθεν ἀναγαγόμενοι ἐκράτησαν , καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς καὶ τὰ ναυάγια ὅσα πρὸς τῇ ἑαυτῶν ἦν ἀνείλοντο , καὶ τοῖς ἐναντίοις τὰ ἐκείνων ὑπόσπονδα ἀπέδοσαν .
On their return the Athenians erected a trophy at the spot from which they put out before gaining the victory; and all the dead and the wrecks that were near their coast they took up, and gave back to the enemy theirs under truce.

2.92.5
1649
 ἔστησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι τροπαῖον ὡς νενικηκότες τῆς τροπῆς , ἃς πρὸς τῇ γῇ διέφθειραν ναῦς ·
The Peloponnesians also erected a trophy, as victors, for the defeat of the ships they had disabled near the shore;

2.92.5
1650
 καὶ ἥνπερ ἔλαβον ναῦν , ἀνέθεσαν ἐπὶ τὸ Ῥίον τὸ Ἀχαϊκὸν παρὰ τὸ τροπαῖον .
and the ship they had taken, they dedicated at the Achaean Rhium by the trophy.

2.92.6
1651
 μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα φοβούμενοι τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων βοήθειαν ὑπὸ νύκτα ἐσέπλευσαν ἐς τὸν κόλπον τὸν Κρισαῖον καὶ Κόρινθον ἅπαντες πλὴν Λευκαδίων .
and the ship they had taken they dedicated at Rhium, in Achaea, by the side of the trophy. Afterwards, being afraid of the reinforcement from Athens, all but the Leucadians sailed at the approach of night into the Crisaean Bay and the port of Corinth.

2.92.7
1652
 καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Κρήτης Ἀθηναῖοι ταῖς εἴκοσι ναυσίν , αἷς ἔδει πρὸ τῆς ναυμαχίας τῷ Φορμίωνι παραγενέσθαι , οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον τῆς ἀναχωρήσεως τῶν νεῶν ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς τὴν Ναύπακτον .
Not long after their retreat, the Athenians from Crete arrived at Naupactus, with the twenty ships that were to have joined Phormio before the engagement.

2.92.7
1653
 καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And thus ended the summer.

2.93.1
1654
 πρὶν δὲ διαλῦσαι τὸ ἐς Κόρινθόν τε καὶ τὸν Κρισαῖον κόλπον ἀναχωρῆσαν ναυτικόν , ὁ Κνῆμος καὶ ὁ Βρασίδας καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ἄρχοντες τῶν Πελοποννησίων ἀρχομένου τοῦ χειμῶνος ἐβούλοντο διδαξάντων Μεγαρέων ἀποπειρᾶσαι τοῦ Πειραιῶς τοῦ λιμένος τῶν Ἀθηναίων ·
Before, however, the fleet dispersed which had retired to Corinth and the Crisaean Bay, Cnemus, Brasidas, and the rest of the Peloponnesian commanders wished, at the suggestion of the Megareans, to make an attempt upon Piraeus, the port of Athens;

2.93.1
1655
 ἦν δὲ ἀφύλακτος καὶ ἄκλῃστος εἰκότως διὰ τὸ ἐπικρατεῖν πολὺ τῷ ναυτικῷ .
which, as was natural from their decided superiority at sea, was left unguarded and open.

2.93.2
1656
 ἐδόκει δὲ λαβόντα τῶν ναυτῶν ἕκαστον τὴν κώπην καὶ τὸ ὑπηρέσιον καὶ τὸν τροπωτῆρα πεζῇ ἰέναι ἐκ Κορίνθου ἐπὶ τὴν πρὸς Ἀθήνας θάλασσαν καὶ ἀφικομένους κατὰ τάχος ἐς Μέγαρα καθελκύσαντας ἐκ Νισαίας τοῦ νεωρίου αὐτῶν τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς , αἳ ἔτυχον αὐτόθι οὖσαι , πλεῦσαι εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ ·
It was determined, therefore, that each man should take his oar, and cushion, and and go by land from Corinth to the sea on the side of Athens; and that after proceeding as quickly as possible to Megara, they should launch from its port, Nisaea, forty vessels that happened to be there, and sail straightway to Piraeus. For there was neither any fleet keeping guard before it, nor any thought of the enemy ever sailing against it in so sudden a manner;

2.93.3
1657
 οὔτε γὰρ ναυτικὸν ἦν προφυλάσσον ἐν αὐτῷ οὐδὲν οὔτε προσδοκία οὐδεμία μὴ ἄν ποτε οἱ πολέμιοι ἐξαπιναίως οὕτως ἐπιπλεύσειαν , ἐπεὶ οὐδ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ προφανοῦς τολμῆσαι ἂν καθ’ ἡσυχίαν , οὐδ’ εἰ διενοοῦντο , μὴ οὐκ ἂν προαισθέσθαι .
and as for their venturing to do it openly and deliberately, they supposed that either they would not think of it, or themselves would not fail to be aware beforehand, if they should. Having adopted this resolution, they proceeded immediately [to execute it];

2.93.4
1658
 ὡς δὲ ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς , καὶ ἐχώρουν εὐθύς ·
and when they had resolved on this, they immediately set out.

2.93.4
1659
 καὶ ἀφικόμενοι νυκτὸς καὶ καθελκύσαντες ἐκ τῆς Νισαίας τὰς ναῦς ἔπλεον ἐπὶ μὲν τὸν Πειραιᾶ οὐκέτι , ὥσπερ διενοοῦντο , καταδείσαντες τὸν κίνδυνον ( καί τις καὶ ἄνεμος αὐτοὺς λέγεται κωλῦσαι ) , ἐπὶ δὲ τῆς Σαλαμῖνος τὸ ἀκρωτήριον τὸ πρὸς Μέγαρα ὁρῶν ·
Arriving by night and launching the vessels from Nisaea, they sailed, not against Athens as they had intended, for they were afraid of the risk, (some wind or other was also said to have prevented them,)

2.93.4
1660
 καὶ φρούριον ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ ἦν καὶ νεῶν τριῶν φυλακὴ τοῦ μὴ ἐσπλεῖν Μεγαρεῦσι μηδὲ ἐκπλεῖν μηδέν .
but to the headland of Salamis looking towards Megara; where there was a fort, and a guard of three ships to prevent anything from being taken in or out of Megara.

2.93.4
1661
 τῷ τε φρουρίῳ προσέβαλον καὶ τὰς τριήρεις ἀφείλκυσαν κενάς , τήν τε ἄλλην Σαλαμῖνα ἀπροσδοκήτοις ἐπιπεσόντες ἐπόρθουν .
So they assaulted the fort, and towed off the triremes empty; and making a sudden attack on the rest of Salamis, they laid it waste.

2.94.1
1662
 ἐς δὲ τὰς Ἀθήνας φρυκτοί τε ᾔροντο πολέμιοι καὶ ἔκπληξις ἐγένετο οὐδεμιᾶς τῶν κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἐλάσσων .
Now fire-signals of an enemy's approach were raised towards Athens, and a consternation was caused by them not exceeded by any during the whole war.

2.94.1
1663
 οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἐν τῷ ἄστει ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ ᾤοντο τοὺς πολεμίους ἐσπεπλευκέναι ἤδη , οἱ δ’ ἐν τῷ Πειραιεῖ τήν τε Σαλαμῖνα ᾑρῆσθαι καὶ παρὰ σφᾶς ὅσον οὐκ ἐσπλεῖν αὐτούς ·
For those in the city imagined that the enemy had already sailed into Piraeus; while those in Piraeus thought that Salamis had been taken, and that they were all but sailing into their harbours:

2.94.1
1664
 ὅπερ ἄν , εἰ ἐβουλήθησαν μὴ κατοκνῆσαι , ῥᾳδίως ἐγένετο , καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἄνεμος ἐκώλυσεν .
which indeed, if they would but have not been afraid of it, might easily have been done; and it was not a wind that would have prevented it.

2.94.2
1665
 βοηθήσαντες δὲ ἅμ’ ἡμέρᾳ πανδημεὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ ναῦς τε καθεῖλκον καὶ ἐσβάντες κατὰ σπουδὴν καὶ πολλῷ θορύβῳ ταῖς μὲν ναυσὶν ἐπὶ τὴν Σαλαμῖνα ἔπλεον , τῷ πεζῷ δὲ φυλακὰς τοῦ Πειραιῶς καθίσταντο .
But at day-break the Athenians went all in a body to Piraeus to resist the enemy; and launched their ships, and going on board with haste and much uproar, sailed with the fleet to Salamis, while with their land-forces they mounted guard at Piraeus.

2.94.3
1666
 οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι ὡς ᾔσθοντο τὴν βοήθειαν , καταδραμόντες τῆς Σαλαμῖνος τὰ πολλὰ καὶ ἀνθρώπους καὶ λείαν λαβόντες καὶ τὰς τρεῖς ναῦς ἐκ τοῦ Βουδόρου τοῦ φρουρίου κατὰ τάχος ἐπὶ τῆς Νισαίας ἀπέπλεον ·
When the Peloponnesians saw them coming to the rescue, after overrunning the greater part of Salamis, and taking both men and booty, and the three ships from the port of Budorum, they sailed for Nisaea as quickly as they could;

2.94.3
1667
 ἔστι γὰρ ὅτι καὶ αἱ νῆες αὐτοὺς διὰ χρόνου καθελκυσθεῖσαι καὶ οὐδὲν στέγουσαι ἐφόβουν .
for their vessels too caused them some alarm, as they had been launched after lying idle a long time, and were not at all water-tight.

2.94.3
1668
 ἀφικόμενοι δὲ ἐς τὰ Μέγαρα πάλιν ἐπὶ τῆς Κορίνθου ἀπεχώρησαν πεζῇ ·
On their arrival at Megara they returned again to Corinth by land.

2.94.4
1669
 οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐκέτι καταλαβόντες πρὸς τῇ Σαλαμῖνι ἀπέπλευσαν καὶ αὐτοί , καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο φυλακὴν ἤδη τοῦ Πειραιῶς μᾶλλον τὸ λοιπὸν ἐποιοῦντο λιμένων τε κλῄσει καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ ἐπιμελείᾳ .
When the Athenians found them no longer on the coast of Salamis, they also sailed back; and after this alarm they paid more attention in future to the safety of Piraeus, both by closing the harbours, and by all other precautions.

2.95.1
1670
 ὑπὸ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους , τοῦ χειμῶνος τούτου ἀρχομένου , Σιτάλκης ὁ Τήρεω Ὀδρύσης Θρᾳκῶν βασιλεὺς ἐστράτευσεν ἐπὶ Περδίκκαν τὸν Ἀλεξάνδρου Μακεδονίας βασιλέα καὶ ἐπὶ Χαλκιδέας τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης , δύο ὑποσχέσεις τὴν μὲν βουλόμενος ἀναπρᾶξαι , τὴν δὲ αὐτὸς ἀποδοῦναι .
About the same period, in the beginning of this winter, Sitalces son of Teres, the king of the Odrysian Thracians, made an expedition against Perdiccas, son of Alexander, king of Macedonia, and the Thrace-ward Chalcidians; of two promises wishing to enforce the one, and himself to perform the other.

2.95.2
1671
 ὅ τε γὰρ Περδίκκας αὐτῷ ὑποσχόμενος , εἰ Ἀθηναίοις τε διαλλάξειεν ἑαυτὸν κατ’ ἀρχὰς τῷ πολέμῳ πιεζόμενον καὶ Φίλιππον τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ πολέμιον ὄντα μὴ καταγάγοι ἐπὶ βασιλείᾳ , ἃ ὑπεδέξατο οὐκ ἐπετέλει ·
For Perdiccas had made him certain promises if he would effect a reconciliation between him and the Athenians, when he was hard pressed by the war at its commencement, and if he would not restore his brother Philip, who was at enmity with him, to place him on the throne; but he was not disposed to perform what he had promised.

2.95.2
1672
 τοῖς τε Ἀθηναίοις αὐτὸς ὡμολογήκει , ὅτε τὴν ξυμμαχίαν ἐποιεῖτο , τὸν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης Χαλκιδικὸν πόλεμον καταλύσειν .
On the other hand, Sitalces had pledged himself to the Athenians, when he entered into alliance with them, to bring the Chalcidian war in Thrace to a successful issue.

2.95.3
1673
 ἀμφοτέρων οὖν ἕνεκα τὴν ἔφοδον ἐποιεῖτο καὶ τόν τε Φιλίππου υἱὸν Ἀμύνταν ὡς ἐπὶ βασιλείᾳ τῶν Μακεδόνων ἦγε καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων πρέσβεις , οἳ ἔτυχον παρόντες τούτων ἕνεκα , καὶ ἡγεμόνα Ἅγνωνα ·
It was with both these objects then that he made the invasion; in which he took with him Philip's son Amyntas, to set him on the throne of Macedonia, and some envoys from Athens, who happened to be at his court on this business, and Hagnon as commander;

2.95.3
1674
 ἔδει γὰρ καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ναυσί τε καὶ στρατιᾷ ὡς πλείστῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς Χαλκιδέας παραγενέσθαι .
for the Athenians also were to join him against the Chalcidians with a fleet, and as large an army as they could raise.

2.96.1
1675
 ἀνίστησιν οὖν ἐκ τῶν Ὀδρυσῶν ὁρμώμενος πρῶτον μὲν τοὺς ἐντὸς τοῦ Αἵμου τε ὄρους καὶ τῆς Ῥοδόπης Θρᾷκας , ὅσων ἦρχε μέχρι θαλάσσης ἐς τὸν Εὔξεινόν τε πόντον καὶ τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον , ἔπειτα τοὺς ὑπερβάντι Αἷμον Γέτας καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα μέρη ἐντὸς τοῦ Ἴστρου ποταμοῦ πρὸς θάλασσαν μᾶλλον τὴν τοῦ Εὐξείνου πόντου κατῴκητο ·
Setting out then from the Odrysians, he summoned to his standard, first the Thracians within Mount Haemus and Rhodope, as many as were subject to him, as far as the coast of the Euxine and the Hellespont;

2.96.1
1676
 εἰσὶ δ’ οἱ Γέται καὶ οἱ ταύτῃ ὅμοροί τε τοῖς Σκύθαις καὶ ὁμόσκευοι , πάντες ἱπποτοξόται .
next the Getae beyond Haemus, and all the other hordes that were settled south of the Danube, more towards the sea-board of the Euxine; the Getae and the tribes in this part being both borderers on the Scythians, and equipped in the same manner, for they are all mounted bowmen.

2.96.2
1677
 παρεκάλει δὲ καὶ τῶν ὀρεινῶν Θρᾳκῶν πολλοὺς τῶν αὐτονόμων καὶ μαχαιροφόρων , οἳ Δῖοι καλοῦνται , τὴν Ῥοδόπην οἱ πλεῖστοι οἰκοῦντες ·
He also invited many of the Highland Thracians, who are independent, and armed with swords; they are called the Dii, and are mostly inhabitants [of the valleys] of Haemus:

2.96.2
1678
 καὶ τοὺς μὲν μισθῷ ἔπειθεν , οἱ δ’ ἐθελονταὶ ξυνηκολούθουν .
some of these he engaged as mercenaries, while others followed him as volunteers.

2.96.3
1679
 ἀνίστη δὲ καὶ Ἀγριᾶνας καὶ Λαιαίους καὶ ἄλλα ὅσα ἔθνη Παιονικὰ ὧν ἦρχε καὶ ἔσχατοι τῆς ἀρχῆς οὗτοι ἦσαν ·
Moreover, he summoned the Agrianians and Laeaemans and all the other Paeonian tribes that acknowledged his sway. And these were the last people in his dominion,

2.96.3
1680
 μέχρι γὰρ Λαιαίων Παιόνων καὶ τοῦ Στρυμόνος ποταμοῦ , ὃς ἐκ τοῦ Σκόμβρου ὄρους δι’ Ἀγριάνων καὶ Λαιαίων ῥεῖ , οὗ ὡρίζετο ἡ ἀρχὴ τὰ πρὸς Παίονας αὐτονόμους ἤδη .
for at the Graaeans and Laeaeans, both of them Paeonian tribes, and at the river Strymon, which flows from Mount Scomius through their country, his empire terminated on the side of the Paeonians, who from this point were independent.

2.96.4
1681
 τὰ δὲ πρὸς Τριβαλλούς , καὶ τούτους αὐτονόμους , Τρῆρες ὥριζον καὶ Τιλαταῖοι ·
On the side of the Triballi, who were also independent, the border tribes were the Treres and Tilataeans,

2.96.4
1682
 οἰκοῦσι δ’ οὗτοι πρὸς βορέαν τοῦ Σκόμβρου ὄρους καὶ παρήκουσι πρὸς ἡλίου δύσιν μέχρι τοῦ Ὀσκίου ποταμοῦ .
who live to the north of Mount Scombrus, and stretch towards the west as far as the river Oscius.

2.96.4
1683
 ῥεῖ δ’ οὗτος ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους ὅθενπερ καὶ ὁ Νέστος καὶ ὁ Ἕβρος ·
This river flows from the same mountain as the Nestus and the Hebrus,

2.96.4
1684
 ἔστι δὲ ἐρῆμον τὸ ὄρος καὶ μέγα , ἐχόμενον τῆς Ῥοδόπης .
an uninhabited and extensive range, joining on to Rhodope.

2.97.1
1685
 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ Ὀδρυσῶν μέγεθος ἐπὶ μὲν θάλασσαν καθήκουσα ἀπὸ Ἀβδήρων πόλεως ἐς τὸν Εὔξεινον πόντον μέχρι Ἴστρου ποταμοῦ ·
The extent then of the Odrysian dominion, taking the line of its sea-coast, was from the city of Abdera to the Euxine, up to the mouth of the Danube.

2.97.1
1686
 αὕτη περίπλους ἐστὶν ἡ γῆ τὰ ξυντομώτατα , ἢν αἰεὶ κατὰ πρύμναν ἱστῆται τὸ πνεῦμα , νηὶ στρογγύλῃ τεσσάρων ἡμερῶν καὶ ἴσων νυκτῶν ·
This tract is by the shortest way a voyage of four days and nights for a merchant-vessel, supposing the wind to be always steady astern.

2.97.1
1687
 ὁδῷ δὲ τὰ ξυντομώτατα ἐξ Ἀβδήρων ἐς Ἴστρον ἀνὴρ εὔζωνος ἑνδεκαταῖος τελεῖ .
By land, taking the shortest way from Abdera to the [mouth of] the Danube, a quick traveller performs the journey in eleven days.

2.97.2
1688
 τὰ μὲν πρὸς θάλασσαν τοσαύτη ἦν , ἐς ἤπειρον δὲ ἀπὸ Βυζαντίου ἐς Λαιαίους καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Στρυμόνα ( ταύτῃ γὰρ διὰ πλείστου ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἄνω ἐγίγνετο ) ἡμερῶν ἀνδρὶ εὐζώνῳ τριῶν καὶ δέκα ἁνύσαι .
Such was the extent of its sea-board. As for the in terror, from Byzantium to the Laeaeans and the Strymon, (for at this point it reached its greatest extent up the country from the sea,) for a quick traveller it was a journey of thirteen days.

2.97.3
1689
 φόρος τε ἐκ πάσης τῆς βαρβάρου καὶ τῶν Ἑλληνίδων πόλεων , ὅσον προσῆξαν ἐπὶ Σεύθου , ὃς ὕστερον Σιτάλκου βασιλεύσας πλεῖστον δὴ ἐποίησε , τετρακοσίων ταλάντων ἀργυρίου μάλιστα δύναμις , ἃ χρυσὸς καὶ ἄργυρος ᾔει ·
The tribute raised from all the barbarian dominions and the Grecian cities, taking the sum which they paid under Seuthes, who was successor of Sitalces, and raised it to its greatest amount, was about 400 talents in gold and silver.

2.97.3
1690
 καὶ δῶρα οὐκ ἐλάσσω τούτων χρυσοῦ τε καὶ ἀργύρου προσεφέρετο , χωρὶς δὲ ὅσα ὑφαντά τε καὶ λεῖα καὶ ἡ ἄλλη κατασκευή , καὶ οὐ μόνον αὐτῷ , ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς παραδυναστεύουσί τε καὶ γενναίοις Ὀδρυσῶν .
Presents were also made to no less an amount in gold and silver; and besides these there was all the clothing, both figured and plain, and other articles for use; and that not only for himself, but for those of the Odrysians also who were his lords and nobles.

2.97.4
1691
 κατεστήσαντο γὰρ τ- ἐναντίον τῆς Περσῶν βασιλείας τὸν νόμον , ὄντα μὲν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις Θρᾳξί , λαμβάνειν μᾶλλον ἢ διδόναι ( καὶ αἴσχιον ἦν αἰτηθέντα μὴ δοῦναι ἢ αἰτήσαντα μὴ τυχεῖν ) , ὅμως δὲ κατὰ τὸ δύνασθαι ἐπὶ πλέον αὐτῷ ἐχρήσαντο ·
For they established their custom the very reverse of that in the Persian kingdom, (though it prevails amongst the rest of the Thracians also,) namely, to receive rather than to give; and it was considered more disgraceful not to give when asked, than not to succeed by asking.

2.97.4
1692
 οὐ γὰρ ἦν πρᾶξαι οὐδὲν μὴ διδόντα δῶρα .
But [though the other Thracians practised the same thing], still the Odrysians, owing to their greater power, practised it to a greater extent;

2.97.4
1693
 ὥστε ἐπὶ μέγα ἡ βασιλεία ἦλθεν ἰσχύος .
for it was impossible to get any thing done without making presents.

2.97.5
1694
 τῶν γὰρ ἐν τῇ Εὐρώπῃ ὅσαι μεταξὺ τοῦ Ἰονίου κόλπου καὶ τοῦ Εὐξείνου πόντου μεγίστη ἐγένετο χρημάτων προσόδῳ καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ εὐδαιμονίᾳ , ἰσχύι δὲ μάχης καὶ στρατοῦ πλήθει πολὺ δευτέρα μετὰ τὴν Σκυθῶν .
The kingdom then had reached a high pitch of power. For of all those in Europe between the Ionian Gulf and the Euxine Sea, it was the greatest in amount of revenue and general prosperity; while in military power and number of troops it was decidedly next to that of the Scythians.

2.97.6
1695
 ταύτῃ δὲ ἀδύνατα ἐξισοῦσθαι οὐχ ὅτι τὰ ἐν τῇ Εὐρώπῃ , ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ ἔθνος ἓν πρὸς ἓν οὐκ ἔστιν ὅτι δυνατὸν Σκύθαις ὁμογνωμονοῦσι πᾶσιν ἀντιστῆναι .
But with  not only is it impossible for those in Europe to vie, but even in Asia, putting one nation against another, there is none that can stand up against the Thracians, if they are all unanimous.

2.97.6
1696
 οὐ μὴν οὐδ’ ἐς τὴν ἄλλην εὐβουλίαν καὶ ξύνεσιν περὶ τῶν παρόντων ἐς τὸν βίον ἄλλοις ὁμοιοῦνται .
Not, however, that they are on a level with other men in general good management and understanding in the things of common life.

2.98.1
1697
 Σιτάλκης μὲν οὖν χώρας τοσαύτης βασιλεύων παρεσκευάζετο τὸν στρατόν .
Sitalces, then, being king over all this extent of country, prepared his army to take the field.

2.98.1
1698
 καὶ ἐπειδὴ αὐτῷ ἑτοῖμα ἦν , ἄρας ἐπορεύετο ἐπὶ τὴν Μακεδονίαν πρῶτον μὲν διὰ τῆς αὑτοῦ ἀρχῆς , ἔπειτα διὰ Κερκίνης ἐρήμου ὄρους , ὅ ἐστι μεθόριον Σιντῶν καὶ Παιόνων ·
And when all was ready for him, he set out and marched against Macedonia; at first through his own dominions, then over Cercine, a desert mountain, which forms the boundary between the Sintians and Paeonians,

2.98.1
1699
 ἐπορεύετο δὲ δι’ αὐτοῦ τῇ ὁδῷ ἣν πρότερον αὐτὸς ἐποιήσατο τεμὼν τὴν ὕλην , ὅτε ἐπὶ Παίονας ἐστράτευσεν .
crossing it by a road which he had himself before made, by felling the timber, when he turned his arms against the Paeonians.

2.98.2
1700
 τὸ δὲ ὄρος ἐξ Ὀδρυσῶν διιόντες ἐν δεξιᾷ μὲν εἶχον Παίονας , ἐν ἀριστερᾷ δὲ Σιντοὺς καὶ Μαιδούς .
In crossing this mountain from the Odrysians, they had the Paeonians on their right, and on their left the Sintians and Maedians;

2.98.2
1701
 διελθόντες δὲ αὐτὸ ἀφίκοντο ἐς Δόβηρον τὴν Παιονικήν .
and after crossing it they arrived at Doberus in Paeonia.

2.98.3
1702
 πορευομένῳ δὲ αὐτῷ ἀπεγίγνετο μὲν οὐδὲν τοῦ στρατοῦ εἰ μή τι νόσῳ , προσεγίγνετο δέ ·
While he was on the march, there was no diminution of his army, (except by disease,) but accessions to it;

2.98.3
1703
 πολλοὶ γὰρ τῶν αὐτονόμων Θρᾳκῶν ἀπαράκλητοι ἐφ’ ἁρπαγὴν ἠκολούθουν , ὥστε τὸ πᾶν πλῆθος λέγεται οὐκ ἔλασσον πέντε καὶ δέκα μυριάδων γενέσθαι ·
for many of the independent Thracians, though uninvited, followed him for plunder; so that the whole number is said to have been not less than one hundred and fifty thousand, of which the greater part was infantry, but about a third cavalry.

2.98.4
1704
 καὶ τούτου τὸ μὲν πλέον πεζὸν ἦν , τριτημόριον δὲ μάλιστα ἱππικόν .
Of the cavalry the Odrysians themselves furnished the largest portion; next to them, the Getae.

2.98.4
1705
 τοῦ δ’ ἱππικοῦ τὸ πλεῖστον αὐτοὶ Ὀδρύσαι παρείχοντο καὶ μετ’ αὐτοὺς Γέται .
Of the infantry, the most warlike were those armed with swords, the independent tribe that came down from Rhodope;

2.98.4
1706
 τοῦ δὲ πεζοῦ οἱ μαχαιροφόροι μαχιμώτατοι μὲν ἦσαν οἱ ἐκ τῆς Ῥοδόπης αὐτόνομοι καταβάντες , ὁ δὲ ἄλλος ὅμιλος ξύμμεικτος πλήθει φοβερώτατος ἠκολούθει .
the rest of the mixed multitude that followed him, was far more formidable for its numbers than any thing else.

2.99.1
1707
 ξυνηθροίζοντο οὖν ἐν τῇ Δοβήρῳ καὶ παρεσκευάζοντο , ὅπως κατὰ κορυφὴν ἐσβαλοῦσιν ἐς τὴν κάτω Μακεδονίαν , ἧς ὁ Περδίκκας ἦρχεν .
They mustered, then, at Doberus, and made their preparations for bursting from the highland down upon the lower Macedonia, which formed the dominion of Perdiccas.

2.99.2
1708
 τῶν γὰρ Μακεδόνων εἰσὶ καὶ Λυγκησταὶ καὶ Ἐλιμιῶται καὶ ἄλλα ἔθνη ἐπάνωθεν , ἃ ξύμμαχα μέν ἐστι τούτοις καὶ ὑπήκοα , βασιλείας δ’ ἔχει καθ’ αὑτά .
For under the name of Macedonians are included also the Lyncestae and Elemiotae, and other highland tribes, which are in alliance with the lowlanders and subject to them, but have separate kingdoms of their own.

2.99.3
1709
 τὴν δὲ παρὰ θάλασσαν νῦν Μακεδονίαν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Περδίκκου πατὴρ καὶ οἱ πρόγονοι αὐτοῦ , Τημενίδαι τὸ ἀρχαῖον ὄντες ἐξ Ἄργους , πρῶτοι ἐκτήσαντο καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν ἀναστήσαντες μάχῃ ἐκ μὲν Πιερίας Πίερας , οἳ ὕστερον ὑπὸ τὸ Πάγγαιον πέραν Στρυμόνος ᾤκησαν Φάγρητα καὶ ἄλλα χωρία ( καὶ ἔτι καὶ νῦν Πιερικὸς κόλπος καλεῖται ἡ ὑπὸ τῷ Παγγαίῳ πρὸς θάλασσαν γῆ ) , ἐκ δὲ τῆς Βοττίας καλουμένης Βοττιαίους , οἳ νῦν ὅμοροι Χαλκιδέων οἰκοῦσιν ·
But the Macedonia along the coast, now properly so called, was first acquired and governed by Alexander, the father of Perdiccas, and his ancestors, who were originally of the family of Temenus of Argos. These expelled by force of arms the Pierians from Pieria, who afterwards lived under Mount Pangaeus, beyond the Strymon, in Phagres and some other places (and even now the country under Pangaeus down to the sea continues to be called the Pierian Gulf). They also drove out of the country called Bottia, the Bottiaeans, who now live on the confines of the Chalcidians;

2.99.4
1710
 τῆς δὲ Παιονίας παρὰ τὸν Ἀξιὸν ποταμὸν στενήν τινα καθήκουσαν ἄνωθεν μέχρι Πέλλης καὶ θαλάσσης ἐκτήσαντο , καὶ πέραν Ἀξιοῦ μέχρι Στρυμόνος τὴν Μυγδονίαν καλουμένην Ἠδῶνας ἐξελάσαντες νέμονται .
while in Paeonia they acquired a narrow strip of territory along the river Axius, stretching down to Pella and the sea-coast; and beyond the Axius, as far as the Strymon, they occupy what is called Mygdonia, having expelled the Edonians from it.

2.99.5
1711
 ἀνέστησαν δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῆς νῦν Ἐορδίας καλουμένης Ἐορδούς , ὧν οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ ἐφθάρησαν , βραχὺ δέ τι αὐτῶν περὶ Φύσκαν κατῴκηται , καὶ ἐξ Ἀλμωπίας Ἄλμωπας .
Again, they drove out the Eordians from what is now called Eordia, (of whom the greater part perished, though a small division of them is settled about Physca,) as also the Almopians from Almopia.

2.99.6
1712
 ἐκράτησαν δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐθνῶν οἱ Μακεδόνες οὗτοι , ἃ καὶ νῦν ἔτι ἔχουσι , τόν τε Ἀνθεμοῦντα καὶ Κρηστωνίαν καὶ Βισαλτίαν καὶ Μακεδόνων αὐτῶν πολλήν .
Those Macedonians, moreover, subdued [the places belonging to] the other tribes, which they still continue to hold, such as Anthemus, Crestonia, Bisaltia, and much of the country that belonged to the original Macedonians.

2.99.6
1713
 τὸ δὲ ξύμπαν Μακεδονία καλεῖται , καὶ Περδίκκας Ἀλεξάνδρου βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν ἦν ὅτε Σιτάλκης ἐπῄει .
The whole of it is called Macedonia, and Perdiccas, son of Alexander, was king of the country when Sitalces invaded it.

2.100.1
1714
 καὶ οἱ μὲν Μακεδόνες οὗτοι ἐπιόντος πολλοῦ στρατοῦ ἀδύνατοι ὄντες ἀμύνεσθαι ἔς τε τὰ καρτερὰ καὶ τὰ τείχη , ὅσα ἦν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ , ἐσεκομίσθησαν .
These Macedonians, then, on the approach of so large an enemy, not being able to offer any resistance, betook themselves to their strong-holds and fortifications, such as they had in the country. These, however, were not numerous;

2.100.2
1715
 ἦν δὲ οὐ πολλά , ἀλλὰ ὕστερον Ἀρχέλαος ὁ Περδίκκου υἱὸς βασιλεὺς γενόμενος τὰ νῦν ὄντα ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ᾠκοδόμησε καὶ ὁδοὺς εὐθείας ἔτεμε καὶ τ- ἄλλα διεκόσμησε τά τε κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἵπποις καὶ ὅπλοις καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ παρασκευῇ κρείσσονι ἢ ξύμπαντες οἱ ἄλλοι βασιλῆς ὀκτὼ οἱ πρὸ αὐτοῦ γενόμενοι .
but it was at a later period that Archelaus son of Perdiccas, when he came to the throne, built those which are now in the country, and cut straight roads, and made other arrangements, both for its having horses and arms for war, and resources of all other kinds, better than had been provided by all the rest of the kings, eight in number, who had preceded him.

2.100.3
1716
 ὁ δὲ στρατὸς τῶν Θρᾳκῶν ἐκ τῆς Δοβήρου ἐσέβαλε πρῶτον μὲν ἐς τὴν Φιλίππου πρότερον οὖσαν ἀρχήν , καὶ εἷλεν Εἰδομενὴν μὲν κατὰ κράτος , Γορτυνίαν δὲ καὶ Ἀταλάντην καὶ ἄλλα ἄττα χωρία ὁμολογίᾳ διὰ τὴν Ἀμύντου φιλίαν προσχωροῦντα τοῦ Φιλίππου υἱέος παρόντος ·
Now the army of the Thracians, advancing from Doberus, overran first of all what had once been the government of Philip; and took Idomene by storm, and Gortynia, Atalanta, and some other places by capitulation, as they came over to him from their friendship for Amyntas, Philip's son, who was with him.

2.100.3
1717
 Εὐρωπὸν δὲ ἐπολιόρκησαν μέν , ἑλεῖν δὲ οὐκ ἐδύναντο .
To Europus they laid siege, but could not reduce it.

2.100.4
1718
 ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν ἄλλην Μακεδονίαν προυχώρει τὴν ἐν ἀριστερᾷ Πέλλης καὶ Κύρρου .
Afterwards he advanced into the rest of Macedonia, on the left of Pella and Cyrrhus.

2.100.4
1719
 ἔσω δὲ τούτων ἐς τὴν Βοττιαίαν καὶ Πιερίαν οὐκ ἀφίκοντο ,ἀλλὰ τήν τε Μυγδονίαν καὶ Κρηστωνίαν καὶ Ἀνθεμοῦντα ἐδῄουν .
Beyond these they did not march, namely, into Bottiaea and Pieria, but stayed to lay waste Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Anthemus.

2.100.5
1720
 οἱ δὲ Μακεδόνες πεζῷ μὲν οὐδὲ διενοοῦντο ἀμύνεσθαι , ἵππους δὲ προσμεταπεμψάμενοι ἀπὸ τῶν ἄνω ξυμμάχων , ὅπῃ δοκοίη , ὀλίγοι πρὸς πολλοὺς ἐσέβαλλον ἐς τὸ στράτευμα τῶν Θρᾳκῶν .
The Macedonians, meanwhile, had not even a thought of resisting them with their infantry; but having sent for an additional supply of horse from their allies in the interior, attacked the Thracian host, few as they were against so many, wherever an opportunity offered.

2.100.5
1721
 καὶ ᾗ μὲν προσπέσοιεν , οὐδεὶς ὑπέμενεν ἄνδρας ἱππέας τε ἀγαθοὺς καὶ τεθωρακισμένους , ὑπὸ δὲ πλήθους περικλῃόμενοι αὑτοὺς πολλαπλασίῳ τῷ ὁμίλῳ ἐς κίνδυνον καθίστασαν , ὥστε τέλος ἡσυχίαν ἦγον , οὐ νομίζοντες ἱκανοὶ εἶναι πρὸς τὸ πλέον κινδυνεύειν .
And wherever they charged them, no one stood his ground against troops who were excellent horsemen and armed with breastplates; but surrounded as they were by superior numbers, they exposed themselves to peril by fighting against that crowd of many times their own number: so that at length they kept quiet, not thinking themselves able to run such hazards against a force so far superior.

2.101.1
1722
 ὁ δὲ Σιτάλκης πρός τε τὸν Περδίκκαν λόγους ἐποιεῖτο ὧν ἕνεκα ἐστράτευσε , καὶ ἐπειδὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐ παρῆσαν ταῖς ναυσίν , ἀπιστοῦντες αὐτὸν μὴ ἥξειν , δῶρα δὲ καὶ πρέσβεις ἔπεμψαν αὐτῷ , ἔς τε τοὺς Χαλκιδέας καὶ Βοττιαίους μέρος τι τοῦ στρατοῦ πέμπει , καὶ τειχήρεις ποιήσας ἐδῄου τὴν γῆν .
In the mean time, Sitalces conferred with Perdiccas on the objects of his expedition; and since the Athenians had not joined him with their fleet, (not believing that he would come,) but had sent presents and envoys to him, he sent a part of his forces against the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans, and after shutting them up within their walls, laid waste their country.

2.101.2
1723
 καθημένου δ’ αὐτοῦ περὶ τοὺς χώρους τούτους οἱ πρὸς νότον οἰκοῦντες Θεσσαλοὶ καὶ Μάγνητες καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ὑπήκοοι Θεσσαλῶν καὶ οἱ μέχρι Θερμοπυλῶν Ἕλληνες ἐφοβήθησαν μὴ καὶ ἐπὶ σφᾶς ὁ στρατὸς χωρήσῃ , καὶ ἐν παρασκευῇ ἦσαν .
While he was staying in these parts, the people towards the south, as the Thessalians, the Magnesians, with others who were subject to the Thessalians, and the Greeks as far as Thermopylae, were afraid that the army might advance against them, and were preparing [for such an event].

2.101.3
1724
 ἐφοβήθησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ πέραν Στρυμόνος πρὸς βορέαν Θρᾷκες , ὅσοι πεδία εἶχον , Παναῖοι καὶ Ὀδόμαντοι καὶ Δρῶοι καὶ Δερσαῖοι ·
The northward Thracians, too, beyond the Strymon were alarmed, as many as lived in a champaign country, namely, the Panaei, the Odomanti, the Droi, and the Dersaei;

2.101.3
1725
 αὐτόνομοι δ’ εἰσὶ πάντες .
who are all independent.

2.101.4
1726
 παρέσχε δὲ λόγον καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς τῶν Ἀθηναίων πολεμίους Ἕλληνας , μὴ ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἀγόμενοι κατὰ τὸ ξυμμαχικὸν καὶ ἐπὶ σφᾶς χωρήσωσιν .
Nay, it afforded subject of discussion even with the Greeks who were enemies of the Athenians, whether they were not led on by that people on the strength of their alliance, and might not come against  also.

2.101.5
1727
 ὁ δὲ τήν τε Χαλκιδικὴν καὶ Βοττικὴν καὶ Μακεδονίαν ἅμα ἐπέχων ἔφθειρε , καὶ ἐπειδὴ αὐτῷ οὐδὲν ἐπράσσετο ὧν ἕνεκα ἐσέβαλε καὶ ἡ στρατιὰ σῖτόν τε οὐκ εἶχεν αὐτῷ καὶ ὑπὸ χειμῶνος ἐταλαιπώρει , ἀναπείθεται ὑπὸ Σεύθου τοῦ Σπαραδόκου , ἀδελφιδοῦ ὄντος καὶ μέγιστον μεθ’ ἑαυτὸν δυναμένου , ὥστ’ ἐν τάχει ἀπελθεῖν .
Sitalces then was commanding at once Chalcidice, Bottica, and Macedonia, and was ravaging them all. But when none of the objects for which he made the expedition was being gained by him, and he found his army without provisions and suffering from the severity of the weather, he was persuaded by Seuthes the son of Spardacus, who was his nephew and next in authority to himself, to return with all speed.

2.101.5
1728
 τὸν δὲ Σεύθην κρύφα Περδίκκας ὑποσχόμενος ἀδελφὴν ἑαυτοῦ δώσειν καὶ χρήματα ἐπ’ αὐτῇ προσποιεῖται .
For Seuthes had been secretly won over by Perdiccas, who promised to give him his sister, and a sum of money with her.

2.101.6
1729
 καὶ ὁ μὲν πεισθεὶς καὶ μείνας τριάκοντα τὰς πάσας ἡμέρας , τούτων δὲ ὀκτὼ ἐν Χαλκιδεῦσιν , ἀνεχώρησε τῷ στρατῷ κατὰ τάχος ἐπ’ οἴκου ·
Thus persuaded then, after remaining [in the enemy's country] thirty days in all, and eight of them in Chalcidice, he retired home with his army as quickly as he could:

2.101.6
1730
 Περδίκκας δὲ ὕστερον Στρατονίκην τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀδελφὴν δίδωσι Σεύθῃ , ὥσπερ ὑπέσχετο .
and Perdiccas subsequently gave his sister Stratonice to Seuthes, as he had promised.

2.101.6
1731
 τὰ μὲν οὖν κατὰ τὴν Σιτάλκου στρατείαν οὕτως ἐγένετο .
Such were the events that happened in the expedition of Sitalces.

2.102.1
1732
 οἱ δὲ ἐν Ναυπάκτῳ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος , ἐπειδὴ τὸ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ναυτικὸν διελύθη , Φορμίωνος ἡγουμένου ἐστράτευσαν , παραπλεύσαντες ἐπ’ Ἀστακοῦ καὶ ἀποβάντες , ἐς τὴν μεσόγειαν τῆς Ἀκαρνανίας τετρακοσίοις μὲν ὁπλίταις Ἀθηναίων τῶν ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν , τετρακοσίοις δὲ Μεσσηνίων , καὶ ἔκ τε Στράτου καὶ Κορόντων καὶ ἄλλων χωρίων ἄνδρας οὐ δοκοῦντας βεβαίους εἶναι ἐξήλασαν , καὶ Κύνητα τὸν Θεολύτου ἐς Κόροντα καταγαγόντες ἀνεχώρησαν πάλιν ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς .
During this winter, after the fleet of the Peloponnesians had dispersed, the Athenians at Naupactus under the command of Phormio, after coasting along to Astacus, and there disembarking, marched into the interior of Acarnania, with four hundred heavy-armed of the Athenians from the ships and four hundred of the Messenians. From Stratus, Coronta, and some other places, they expelled certain individuals who were not thought to be true to them; and having restored Cynes son of Theolytus to Coronta, returned again to their vessels.

2.102.2
1733
 ἐς γὰρ Οἰνιάδας αἰεί ποτε πολεμίους ὄντας μόνους Ἀκαρνάνων οὐκ ἐδόκει δυνατὸν εἶναι χειμῶνος ὄντος στρατεύειν ·
For against the Aeniadae, who alone of the Acarnanians had always been hostile to them, they did not think it possible to march during the winter,

2.102.2
1734
 ὁ γὰρ Ἀχελῷος ποταμὸς ῥέων ἐκ Πίνδου ὄρους διὰ Δολοπίας καὶ Ἀγραίων καὶ Ἀμφιλόχων καὶ διὰ τοῦ Ἀκαρνανικοῦ πεδίου , ἄνωθεν μὲν παρὰ Στράτον πόλιν , ἐς θάλασσαν δ’ ἐξιεὶς παρ’ Οἰνιάδας καὶ τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῖς περιλιμνάζων , ἄπορον ποιεῖ ὑπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος ἐν χειμῶνι στρατεύειν .
as the river Achelous, which flows from Mount Pindus through Dolopia and the country of the Agraeans and Amphilochians and the plain of Acarnania, passing by the town of Stratus in the upper part of its course, and by Aeniadae near its mouth, forms lakes round their city, and so makes it impracticable to lead an army against it in the winter on account of the water.

2.102.3
1735
 κεῖνται δὲ καὶ τῶν νήσων τῶν Ἐχινάδων αἱ πολλαὶ καταντικρὺ Οἰνιαδῶν τοῦ Ἀχελῴου τῶν ἐκβολῶν οὐδὲν ἀπέχουσαι , ὥστε μέγας ὢν ὁ ποταμὸς προσχοῖ αἰεὶ καὶ εἰσὶ τῶν νήσων αἳ ἠπείρωνται , ἐλπὶς δὲ καὶ πάσας οὐκ ἐν πολλῷ τινὶ ἂν χρόνῳ τοῦτο παθεῖν ·
Opposite to Aeniadae he most of the islands called Echinades, close to the mouths of the Achelous; so that the river, being so large as it is, continually forms depositions round them, and some of the islands have been joined to the continent, as I expect will be the case with all of them in no long period of time.

2.102.4
1736
 τό τε γὰρ ῥεῦμά ἐστι μέγα καὶ πολὺ καὶ θολερόν , αἵ τε νῆσοι πυκναί , καὶ ἀλλήλαις τῆς προσχώσεως τῷ μὴ σκεδάννυσθαι ξύνδεσμοι γίγνονται , παραλλὰξ καὶ οὐ κατὰ στοῖχον κείμεναι , οὐδ’ ἔχουσαι εὐθείας διόδους τοῦ ὕδατος ἐς τὸ πέλαγος .
For the stream is strong, and deep, and turbid, and the islands are thick together, and mutually serve to connect the alluvium so as to prevent its being dispersed; as they lie in alternating rows, not in one line, and have no free passages for the water into the open sea. They are uninhabited, and of no great extent.

2.102.5
1737
 ἐρῆμοι δ’ εἰσὶ καὶ οὐ μεγάλαι .
There is a report which I may also mention, that when Alemaeon, son of Amphiaraus, was wandering about after the murder of his mother, Apollo directed him by an oracle to inhabit this region, by suggesting to him that he would have no release from his terrors till he should discover and inhabit a country which had not yet been seen by the sun, nor existed as land, at the time he slew his mother; since all the rest of the earth was polluted to him.

2.102.5
1738
 λέγεται δὲ καὶ Ἀλκμέωνι τῷ Ἀμφιάρεω , ὅτε δὴ ἀλᾶσθαι αὐτὸν μετὰ τὸν φόνον τῆς μητρός , τὸν Ἀπόλλω ταύτην τὴν γῆν χρῆσαι οἰκεῖν , ὑπειπόντα οὐκ εἶναι λύσιν τῶν δειμάτων πρὶν ἂν εὑρὼν ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ χώρᾳ κατοικίσηται ἥτις ὅτε ἔκτεινε τὴν μητέρα μήπω ὑπὸ ἡλίου ἑωρᾶτο μηδὲ γῆ ἦν , ὡς τῆς γε ἄλλης αὐτῷ μεμιασμένης .
There is a report which I may also mention, that when Alemaeon, son of Amphiaraus, was wandering about after the murder of his mother, Apollo directed him by an oracle to inhabit this region, by suggesting to him that he would have no release from his terrors till he should discover and inhabit a country which had not yet been seen by the sun, nor existed as land, at the time he slew his mother; since all the rest of the earth was polluted to him.

2.102.6
1739
 ὁ δ’ ἀπορῶν , ὥς φασι , μόλις κατενόησε τὴν πρόσχωσιν ταύτην τοῦ Ἀχελῴου , καὶ ἐδόκει αὐτῷ ἱκανὴ ἂν κεχῶσθαι δίαιτα τῷ σώματι ἀφ’ οὗπερ κτείνας τὴν μητέρα οὐκ ὀλίγον χρόνον ἐπλανᾶτο .
He was perplexed, they say, [by such a command]; but at length observed this alluvial deposition of the Achelous, and thought that enough might have been thrown up to support life during the long period that he had been a wanderer since killing his mother.

2.102.6
1740
 καὶ κατοικισθεὶς ἐς τοὺς περὶ Οἰνιάδας τόπους ἐδυνάστευσέ τε καὶ ἀπὸ Ἀκαρνᾶνος παιδὸς ἑαυτοῦ τῆς χώρας τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν ἐγκατέλιπεν .
Accordingly he settled in the parts about Aeniadae, and became powerful, and left the name to the country from his son Acarnan.

2.102.6
1741
 τὰ μὲν περὶ Ἀλκμέωνα τοιαῦτα λεγόμενα παρελάβομεν .
Such is the account we have received respecting Alcmaeon.

2.103.1
1742
 οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ ὁ Φορμίων ἄραντες ἐκ τῆς Ἀκαρνανίας καὶ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς τὴν Ναύπακτον ἅμα ἦρι κατέπλευσαν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας , τούς τε ἐλευθέρους τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ἐκ τῶν ναυμαχιῶν ἄγοντες , οἳ ἀνὴρ ἀντ’ ἀνδρὸς ἐλύθησαν , καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἃς εἷλον .
The Athenians then, and Phormio, having departed from Acarnania and arrived at Naupactus, sailed home to Athens at the return of spring, taking with them such of the prisoners from the naval battles as were freemen, (who were exchanged man for man,) and the ships they had captured.

2.103.1
1743
 καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα οὗτος , καὶ τρίτον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
Thus ended this winter, and the third year of this war of which Thucydides wrote.



3.1.1
1744
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἅμα τῷ σίτῳ ἀκμάζοντι ἐστράτευσαν ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν ·
THE following summer, as soon as the corn was ripe, the Peloponnesians and their allies invaded Attica,


3.1.1
1745
ἡγεῖτο δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ Ζευξιδάμου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς .
under the command of Archidamus, son of Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians.


3.1.2
1746
καὶ ἐγκαθεζόμενοι ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν ·
There they encamped, and laid waste the land;


3.1.2
1747
καὶ προσβολαί , ὥσπερ εἰώθεσαν , ἐγίγνοντο τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἱππέων ὅπῃ παρείκοι , καὶ τὸν πλεῖστον ὅμιλον τῶν ψιλῶν εἶργον τὸ μὴ προεξιόντας τῶν ὅπλων τὰ ἐγγὺς τῆς πόλεως κακουργεῖν .
while charges were made upon them, as usual, by the Athenian cavalry, wherever opportunity offered; and they prevented the main host of the light-armed from advancing far from their camp, and damaging the property near the city.


3.1.3
1748
ἐμμείναντες δὲ χρόνον οὗ εἶχον τὰ σιτία ἀνεχώρησαν καὶ διελύθησαν κατὰ πόλεις .
After remaining in the country the time for which they had taken provisions, they returned and dispersed to their respective cities.


3.2.1
1749
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἐσβολὴν τῶν Πελοποννησίων εὐθὺς Λέσβος πλὴν Μηθύμνης ἀπέστη ἀπ’ Ἀθηναίων , βουληθέντες μὲν καὶ πρὸ τοῦ πολέμου , ἀλλ’ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὐ προσεδέξαντο , ἀναγκασθέντες δὲ καὶ ταύτην τὴν ἀπόστασιν πρότερον ἢ διενοοῦντο ποιήσασθαι .
Immediately after the invasion of the Peloponnesians, all Lesbos, with the exception of Methymna, revolted from the Athenians; having wished indeed to do so before the commencement of the war, (the Lacedaemonians, however, did not accept their offers,) and yet compelled even now to execute their purpose sooner than they intended.


3.2.2
1750
τῶν τε γὰρ λιμένων τὴν χῶσιν καὶ τειχῶν οἰκοδόμησιν καὶ νεῶν ποίησιν ἐπέμενον τελεσθῆναι , καὶ ὅσα ἐκ τοῦ Πόντου ἔδει ἀφικέσθαι , τοξότας τε καὶ σῖτον , καὶ ἃ μεταπεμπόμενοι ἦσαν .
For they were inclined to wait the completion of the moles for the security of their harbours, and of the building of their walls and ships, and the arrival of all that was to come from the Pontus, namely, bowmen and corn, and whatever they had sent for.


3.2.3
1751
Τενέδιοι γὰρ ὄντες αὐτοῖς διάφοροι καὶ Μηθυμναῖοι καὶ αὐτῶν Μυτιληναίων ἰδίᾳ ἄνδρες κατὰ στάσιν , πρόξενοι Ἀθηναίων , μηνυταὶ γίγνονται τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ὅτι ξυνοικίζουσί τε τὴν Λέσβον ἐς τὴν Μυτιλήνην βίᾳ καὶ τὴν παρασκευὴν ἅπασαν μετὰ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Βοιωτῶν ξυγγενῶν ὄντων ἐπὶ ἀποστάσει ἐπείγονται ·
[But this they were prevented doing;] for the Tenedians, who were at variance with them, and the Methymnaeans, and even some private individuals of the Mytilenaeans, under the influence of party spirit, as of the Athenians informed that people that the Mytilenaeans were forcibly bringing [the rest of] Lesbos into union with their own city, and hurrying all their preparations for a revolt, in conjunction with the Lacedaemonians and Boeotians, who were of the sale face as themselves,


3.2.3
1752
καὶ εἰ μή τις προκαταλήψεται ἤδη , στερήσεσθαι αὐτοὺς Λέσβου .
and that if some one did not at once anticipate their designs, they would lose Lesbos.


3.3.1
1753
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἦσαν γὰρ τεταλαιπωρημένοι ὑπό τε τῆς νόσου καὶ τοῦ πολέμου ἄρτι καθισταμένου καὶ ἀκμάζοντος ) μέγα μὲν ἔργον ἡγοῦντο εἶναι Λέσβον προσπολεμώσασθαι ναυτικὸν ἔχουσαν καὶ δύναμιν ἀκέραιον , καὶ οὐκ ἀπεδέχοντο τὸ πρῶτον τὰς κατηγορίας , μεῖζον μέρος νέμοντες τῷ μὴ βούλεσθαι ἀληθῆ εἶναι ·
But the Athenians (being distressed by the plague and the war, which had so recently broken out and was now at its height) thought it a serious business to incur the additional hostility of Lesbos, with her fleet and power hitherto unimpaired; and were not at first disposed to listen to the charges, allowing too much weight to their wish that it might not be true.


3.3.1
1754
ἐπειδὴ μέντοι καὶ πέμψαντες πρέσβεις οὐκ ἔπειθον τοὺς Μυτιληναίους τήν τε ξυνοίκισιν καὶ τὴν παρασκευὴν διαλύειν , δείσαντες προκαταλαβεῖν ἐβούλοντο .
When, however, they had even sent ambassadors without prevailing on the Mytilenaeans to stop their measures for the union and their preparations, they were alarmed, and wished to reduce them by surprise.


3.3.2
1755
καὶ πέμπουσιν ἐξαπιναίως τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς αἳ ἔτυχον περὶ Πελοπόννησον παρεσκευασμέναι πλεῖν ·
Accordingly they despatched with all haste forty ships that happened to have been equipped for cruising round the Peloponnese,


3.3.2
1756
Κλεϊππίδης δὲ ὁ Δεινίου τρίτος αὐτὸς ἐστρατήγει .
under the command of Cleïppides son of Dinias, and two colleagues.


3.3.3
1757
ἐσηγγέλθη γὰρ αὐτοῖς ὡς εἴη Ἀπόλλωνος Μαλόεντος ἔξω τῆς πόλεως ἑορτή , ἐν ᾗ πανδημεὶ Μυτιληναῖοι ἑορτάζουσι , καὶ ἐλπίδα εἶναι ἐπειχθέντας ἐπιπεσεῖν ἄφνω , καὶ ἢν μὲν ξυμβῇ ἡ πεῖρα ·
For information had been brought them that there was a festival in honour of the Malean Apollo outside the city, at which all the people of the Mytilenaeans kept holyday; and there was reason to hope that by coming with all speed they would thus fall upon them by surprise.


3.3.3
1758
εἰ δὲ μή , Μυτιληναίοις εἰπεῖν ναῦς τε παραδοῦναι καὶ τείχη καθελεῖν , μὴ πειθομένων δὲ πολεμεῖν .
If then the attempt should succeed, [all would be well]; if not, they should charge the Mytilenaeans to deliver up their fleet and dismantle their walls;


3.3.4
1759
καὶ αἱ μὲν νῆες ᾤχοντο ·
and if they did not obey, should make war upon them.


3.3.4
1760
τὰς δὲ τῶν Μυτιληναίων δέκα τριήρεις , αἳ ἔτυχον βοηθοὶ παρὰ σφᾶς κατὰ τὸ ξυμμαχικὸν παροῦσαι , κατέσχον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐς φυλακὴν ἐποιήσαντο .
So the ships set sail; but the ten triremes of the Mytilenaeans, which had come to them as a reinforcement, according to the terms of their alliance, were detained by the Athenians, and the crews of them were put in prison.


3.3.5
1761
τοῖς δὲ Μυτιληναίοις ἀνὴρ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν διαβὰς ἐς Εὔβοιαν καὶ πεζῇ ἐπὶ Γεραιστὸν ἐλθών , ὁλκάδος ἀναγομένης ἐπιτυχών , πλῷ χρησάμενος καὶ τριταῖος ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ἐς Μυτιλήνην ἀφικόμενος ἀγγέλλει τὸν ἐπίπλουν .
The Mytilenaeans, however, were informed of the expedition against them by a man who crossed over from Athens to Euboea, and having gone by land to Geraestus, there found a merchant-vessel getting under weigh, and so proceeded by sea, and arrived at Mytilene the third day after leaving Athens.


3.3.5
1762
οἱ δὲ οὔτε ἐς τὸν Μαλόεντα ἐξῆλθον , τά τε ἄλλα τῶν τειχῶν καὶ λιμένων περὶ τὰ ἡμιτέλεστα φαρξάμενοι ἐφύλασσον .
Accordingly they both abstained from going out to the temple at Malea, and, for the rest, barricaded and kept guard around their half-finished walls.


3.4.1
1763
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον καταπλεύσαντες ὡς ἑώρων , ἀπήγγειλαν μὲν οἱ στρατηγοὶ τὰ ἐπεσταλμένα , οὐκ ἐσακουόντων δὲ τῶν Μυτιληναίων ἐς πόλεμον καθίσταντο .
When the Athenians sailed up soon after and saw this, the commanders delivered their orders; and as the Mytilenaeans did not obey them, they commenced hostilities.


3.4.2
1764
ἀπαράσκευοι δὲ οἱ Μυτιληναῖοι καὶ ἐξαίφνης ἀναγκασθέντες πολεμεῖν ἔκπλουν μέν τινα ἐποιήσαντο τῶν νεῶν ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίαν ὀλίγον πρὸ τοῦ λιμένος , ἔπειτα καταδιωχθέντες ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀττικῶν νεῶν λόγους ἤδη προσέφερον τοῖς στρατηγοῖς , βουλόμενοι τὰς ναῦς τὸ παραυτίκα , εἰ δύναιντο , ὁμολογίᾳ τινὶ ἐπιεικεῖ ἀποπέμψασθαι .
Being thus compelled to go to war while unprepared, and without any notice, the Mytilenaeans sailed out with their fleet to battle, a short distance from their harbour; but when driven to shore by the Athenian ships, they then proposed terms to the commanders, wishing, if they could, to get the squadron sent back for the present on any reasonable conditions.


3.4.3
1765
καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπεδέξαντο καὶ αὐτοὶ φοβούμενοι μὴ οὐχ ἱκανοὶ ὦσι Λέσβῳ πάσῃ πολεμεῖν .
The Athenian commanders agreed to their proposals, having fears on  side also, that they might not be able to carry on war with the whole of Lesbos.


3.4.4
1766
καὶ ἀνοκωχὴν ποιησάμενοι πέμπουσιν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας οἱ Μυτιληναῖοι τῶν τε διαβαλλόντων ἕνα , ᾧ μετέμελεν ἤδη , καὶ ἄλλους , εἴ πως πείσειαν τὰς ναῦς ἀπελθεῖν ὡς σφῶν οὐδὲν νεωτεριούντων .
Accordingly, having concluded an armistice, the Mytilenaeans sent to Athens one of their accusers, who now repented [of what he had said], and some others, to try if by any means they might persuade them to let the squadron return, on the belief of their meditating no innovation.


3.4.5
1767
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἀποστέλλουσι καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πρέσβεις τριήρει , λαθόντες τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ναυτικόν , οἳ ὥρμουν ἐν τῇ Μαλέᾳ πρὸς βορέαν τῆς πόλεως ·
In the mean time they also sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon in a trireme, having escaped the observation of the Athenian fleet, which was anchored at Malea, northward of the city;


3.4.5
1768
οὐ γὰρ ἐπίστευον τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων προχωρήσειν .
for they were not confident of the success of the answer from Athens.


3.4.6
1769
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα ταλαιπώρως διὰ τοῦ πελάγους κομισθέντες αὐτοῖς ἔπρασσον ὅπως τις βοήθεια ἥξει ·
These having reached Lacedaemon with much trouble across the open sea, negotiated for some succours being sent to them.


3.5.1
1770
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν πρέσβεις ὡς οὐδὲν ἦλθον πράξαντες , ἐς πόλεμον καθίσταντο οἱ Μυτιληναῖοι καὶ ἡ ἄλλη Λέσβος πλὴν Μηθύμνης ·
When the ambassadors from Athens came back without having effected any thing, the Mytilenaeans commenced hostilities, and all the rest of Lesbos excepting [the people of] Methymna;


3.5.1
1771
οὗτοι δὲ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐβεβοηθήκεσαν , καὶ Ἴμβριοι καὶ Λήμνιοι καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὀλίγοι τινὲς ξυμμάχων .
but these had reinforced the Athenians, with the Imbrians, Lesbians, and some few of the rest of the allies.


3.5.2
1772
καὶ ἔξοδον μέν τινα πανδημεὶ ἐποιήσαντο οἱ Μυτιληναῖοι ἐπὶ τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατόπεδον , καὶ μάχη ἐγένετο , ἐν ᾗ οὐκ ἔλασσον ἔχοντες οἱ Μυτιληναῖοι οὔτε ἐπηυλίσαντο οὔτε ἐπίστευσαν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς , ἀλλ’ ἀνεχώρησαν ·
The Mytilenaeans then made a sally with all their forces against the camp of the Athenians; and a battle was fought, in which though the former had the advantage, they neither spent the night on the field, nor felt any confidence in themselves, but withdrew.


3.5.2
1773
ἔπειτα οἱ μὲν ἡσύχαζον , ἐκ Πελοποννήσου καὶ μετ’ ἄλλης παρασκευῆς βουλόμενοι εἰ προσγένοιτό τι κινδυνεύειν ·
After this they remained quiet, wishing to hazard a battle in conjunction with additional troops from the Peloponnese, if any force should join them:


3.5.2
1774
καὶ γὰρ αὐτοῖς Μελέας Λάκων ἀφικνεῖται καὶ Ἑρμαιώνδας Θηβαῖος , οἳ προαπεστάλησαν μὲν τῆς ἀποστάσεως , φθάσαι δὲ οὐ δυνάμενοι τὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπίπλουν κρύφα μετὰ τὴν μάχην ὕστερον ἐσπλέουσι τριήρει , καὶ παρῄνουν πέμπειν τριήρη ἄλλην καὶ πρέσβεις μεθ’ ἑαυτῶν ·
(for there had come to them Meleas, a Lacedaemonian, and Hermaeondas, a Theban, who had been despatched before the revolt, but not being able to anticipate the expedition of the Athenians, sailed up by stealth in a trireme after the battle, and advised them to send another trireme and ambassadors in company with themselves


3.5.2
1775
καὶ ἐκπέμπουσιν .
which they did.)


3.6.1
1776
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι πολὺ ἐπιρρωσθέντες διὰ τὴν τῶν Μυτιληναίων ἡσυχίαν ξυμμάχους τε προσεκάλουν , οἳ πολὺ θᾶσσον παρῆσαν ὁρῶντες οὐδὲν ἰσχυρὸν ἀπὸ τῶν Λεσβίων , καὶ περιορμισάμενοι τὸ πρὸς νότον τῆς πόλεως ἐτείχισαν στρατόπεδα δύο ἑκατέρωθεν τῆς πόλεως , καὶ τοὺς ἐφόρμους ἐπ’ ἀμφοτέροις τοῖς λιμέσιν ἐποιοῦντο .
The Athenians, on the other hand, being much assured by the quiet of the Mytilenaeans, were calling allies to join them, who came much quicker from seeing no vigour on the part of the Lesbians; and bringing round their ships to a new station on the south of the town, they fortified two camps, one on each side of the town, and established their blockades at both the harbours.


3.6.2
1777
καὶ τῆς μὲν θαλάσσης εἶργον μὴ χρῆσθαι τοὺς Μυτιληναίους , τῆς δὲ γῆς τῆς μὲν ἄλλης ἐκράτουν οἱ Μυτιληναῖοι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Λέσβιοι προσβεβοηθηκότες ἤδη , τὸ δὲ περὶ τὰ στρατόπεδα οὐ πολὺ κατεῖχον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ναύσταθμον δὲ μᾶλλον ἦν αὐτοῖς πλοίων καὶ ἀγορὰ ἡ Μαλέα .
Thus they excluded the Mytilenaeans from the use of the sea; but of the whole of the land they were still masters, with the rest of the Lesbians who had now come to their assistance;


3.6.2
1778
καὶ τὰ μὲν περὶ Μυτιλήνην οὕτως ἐπολεμεῖτο .
while the Athenians commanded only the small extent round their camps, Malea being rather a station for their ships and a market [than anything else]. Such were the features of the war about Mytilene.


3.7.1
1779
κατὰ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον τοῦ θέρους τούτου Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ περὶ Πελοπόννησον ναῦς ἀπέστειλαν τριάκοντα καὶ Ἀσώπιον τὸν Φορμίωνος στρατηγόν , κελευσάντων Ἀκαρνάνων τῶν Φορμίωνός τινα σφίσι πέμψαι ἢ υἱὸν ἢ ξυγγενῆ ἄρχοντα .
About the same period of this summer the Athenians also despatched thirty ships to the Peloponnese, with Asopius son of Phormio as commander; the Acarnanians having requested them to send them either a son or other relative of his to take the command.


3.7.2
1780
καὶ παραπλέουσαι αἱ νῆες τῆς Λακωνικῆς τὰ ἐπιθαλάσσια χωρία ἐπόρθησαν .
The ships, as they coasted along, ravaged the maritime towns of Laconia.


3.7.3
1781
ἔπειτα τὰς μὲν πλείους ἀποπέμπει τῶν νεῶν πάλιν ἐπ’ οἴκου ὁ Ἀσώπιος , αὐτὸς δ’ ἔχων δώδεκα ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Ναύπακτον , καὶ ὕστερον Ἀκαρνᾶνας ἀναστήσας πανδημεὶ στρατεύει ἐπ’ Οἰνιάδας , καὶ ταῖς τε ναυσὶ κατὰ τὸν Ἀχελῷον ἔπλευσε καὶ ὁ κατὰ γῆν στρατὸς ἐδῄου τὴν χώραν .
Afterwards Asopius sent back home the greater part of them, but himself went to Naupactus with twelve; and subsequently, having raised the whole population of the Acarnanians, marched against $Oeniadae; sailing with his fleet by the Achelous, and his army by land laying waste the country.


3.7.4
1782
ὡς δ’ οὐ προσεχώρουν , τὸν μὲν πεζὸν ἀφίησιν , αὐτὸς δὲ πλεύσας ἐς Λευκάδα καὶ ἀπόβασιν ἐς Νήρικον ποιησάμενος ἀναχωρῶν διαφθείρεται αὐτός τε καὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς τι μέρος ὑπὸ τῶν αὐτόθεν τε ξυμβοηθησάντων καὶ φρουρῶν τινῶν ὀλίγων .
When it did not surrender, he dismissed his land-forces, and having himself sailed to Leucas, and made a descent upon Nericus, was cut off on his return, and some part of his army with him, by the people of the neighbourhood who had come to the rescue, and some few guard-troops.


3.7.5
1783
καὶ ὕστερον ὑποσπόνδους τοὺς νεκροὺς ἀποπλεύσαντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι παρὰ τῶν Λευκαδίων ἐκομίσαντο .
The Athenians, after sailing away, subsequently recovered their dead from the Leucadians by treaty.


3.8.1
1784
οἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς πρώτης νεὼς ἐκπεμφθέντες Μυτιληναίων πρέσβεις , ὡς αὐτοῖς οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι εἶπον Ὀλυμπίαζε παρεῖναι , ὅπως καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ξύμμαχοι ἀκούσαντες βουλεύσωνται , ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς τὴν Ὀλυμπίαν ·
Now the ambassadors of the Mytilenaeans sent out in the first ship, being told by the Lacedaemonians to come to Olympia, in order that the rest of the confederates also might hear and consult upon their case, accordingly went thither.


3.8.1
1785
ἦν δὲ Ὀλυμπιὰς ᾗ Δωριεὺς Ῥόδιος τὸ δεύτερον ἐνίκα .
It was the Olympiad at which Dorieus the Rhodian gained his second victory.


3.8.2
1786
καὶ ἐπειδὴ μετὰ τὴν ἑορτὴν κατέστησαν ἐς λόγους , εἶπον τοιάδε .
And when after the festival they came to a conference, the envoys spoke as follows:


3.9.1
1787
&quot; τὸ μὲν καθεστὸς τοῖς Ἕλλησι νόμιμον , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ ξύμμαχοι , ἴσμεν ·
"With the settled principle of the Greeks with regard to a case like ours, Lacedaemonians and allies, we are well acquainted;


3.9.1
1788
τοὺς γὰρ ἀφισταμένους ἐν τοῖς πολέμοις καὶ ξυμμαχίαν τὴν πρὶν ἀπολείποντας οἱ δεξάμενοι , καθ’ ὅσον μὲν ὠφελοῦνται , ἐν ἡδονῇ ἔχουσι , νομίζοντες δὲ εἶναι προδότας τῶν πρὸ τοῦ φίλων χείρους ἡγοῦνται .
for when men revolt in war, and leave their former confederacy, those who receive them are pleased with them so far as they derive benefit from them; but inasmuch as they consider them traitors to their former friends, they have a meaner opinion of them.


3.9.2
1789
καὶ οὐκ ἄδικος αὕτη ἡ ἀξίωσίς ἐστιν , εἰ τύχοιεν πρὸς ἀλλήλους οἵ τε ἀφιστάμενοι καὶ ἀφ’ ὧν διακρίνοιντο ἴσοι μὲν τῇ γνώμῃ ὄντες καὶ εὐνοίᾳ , ἀντίπαλοι δὲ τῇ παρασκευῇ καὶ δυνάμει , πρόφασίς τε ἐπιεικὴς μηδεμία ὑπάρχοι τῆς ἀποστάσεως ·
And this is no unfair estimate of their conduct, supposing that both those who revolt, and those from whom they separate, agreed in their views and in kindly feeling, and were equally matched in resources and power, and no reasonable ground for the revolt previously existed.


3.9.2
1790
ὃ ἡμῖν καὶ Ἀθηναίοις οὐκ ἦν .
But this was not the case with us and the Athenians;


3.9.3
1791
μηδέ τῳ χείρους δόξωμεν εἶναι εἰ ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ τιμώμενοι ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς δεινοῖς ἀφιστάμεθα .
nor ought we to be worse thought of by any one for revolting from them in the time of their peril, when we were honoured by them in time of peace.


3.10.1
1792
&quot; περὶ γὰρ τοῦ δικαίου καὶ ἀρετῆς πρῶτον ἄλλως τε καὶ ξυμμαχίας δεόμενοι τοὺς λόγους ποιησόμεθα , εἰδότες οὔτε φιλίαν ἰδιώταις βέβαιον γιγνομένην οὔτε κοινωνίαν πόλεσιν ἐς οὐδέν , εἰ μὴ μετ’ ἀρετῆς δοκούσης ἐς ἀλλήλους γίγνοιντο καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὁμοιότροποι εἶεν ·
"For it is on the justice and goodness of our cause that we will first address you, especially as we are requesting the favour of your alliance; knowing that neither friendship between individuals, nor league between communities, is ever lasting, unless they formed the connexion with an appearance of good principle towards each other, and were of congenial dispositions in other respects;


3.10.1
1793
ἐν γὰρ τῷ διαλλάσσοντι τῆς γνώμης καὶ αἱ διαφοραὶ τῶν ἔργων καθίστανται .
for from difference of feelings difference of conduct also arises.


3.10.2
1794
ἡμῖν δὲ καὶ Ἀθηναίοις ξυμμαχία ἐγένετο πρῶτον ἀπολιπόντων μὲν ὑμῶν ἐκ τοῦ Μηδικοῦ πολέμου , παραμεινάντων δὲ ἐκείνων πρὸς τὰ ὑπόλοιπα τῶν ἔργων .
Now between us and the Athenians alliance was first made when you left us, and withdrew from the Median war, while they stood by us to finish the business.


3.10.3
1795
ξύμμαχοι μέντοι ἐγενόμεθα οὐκ ἐπὶ καταδουλώσει τῶν Ἑλλήνων Ἀθηναίοις , ἀλλ’ ἐπ’ ἐλευθερώσει ἀπὸ τοῦ Μήδου τοῖς Ἕλλησιν .
We became allies, however, not to the Athenians for the enslaving of the Greeks, but to the Greeks for their liberation from the Mede. And so long as they led us on equal terms, we followed them heartily;


3.10.4
1796
καὶ μέχρι μὲν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ἡγοῦντο , προθύμως εἱπόμεθα ·
but when we saw them relaxing in their hostility to the Mede,


3.10.4
1797
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἑωρῶμεν αὐτοὺς τὴν μὲν τοῦ Μήδου ἔχθραν ἀνιέντας , τὴν δὲ τῶν ξυμμάχων δούλωσιν ἐπαγομένους , οὐκ ἀδεεῖς ἔτι ἦμεν .
and undertaking to enslave the Greeks, we were no longer without alarm.


3.10.5
1798
ἀδύνατοι δὲ ὄντες καθ’ ἓν γενόμενοι διὰ πολυψηφίαν ἀμύνασθαι οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐδουλώθησαν πλὴν ἡμῶν καὶ Χίων ·
Being incapable, however, through the number of those who had votes, to join together and defend themselves, the allies were reduced to slavery, except ourselves and the Chians;


3.10.5
1799
ἡμεῖς δὲ αὐτόνομοι δὴ ὄντες καὶ ἐλεύθεροι τῷ ὀνόματι ξυνεστρατεύσαμεν .
but joined their enterprises as independent, forsooth, and free-in And now we had no longer in the Athenians such leaders as we could trust, having before us the examples that were already given:


3.10.6
1800
καὶ πιστοὺς οὐκέτι εἴχομεν ἡγεμόνας Ἀθηναίους , παραδείγμασι τοῖς προγιγνομένοις χρώμενοι ·
for it was not likely that they should reduce to subjection those whom they had taken into treaty along with us,


3.10.6
1801
οὐ γὰρ εἰκὸς ἦν αὐτοὺς οὓς μὲν μεθ’ ἡμῶν ἐνσπόνδους ἐποιήσαντο καταστρέψασθαι , τοὺς δὲ ὑπολοίπους , εἴ ποτε ἄρα ἐδυνήθησαν , μὴ δρᾶσαι τοῦτο .
and not do the same to the rest, if ever they had the power.


3.11.1
1802
καὶ εἰ μὲν αὐτόνομοι ἔτι ἦμεν ἅπαντες , βεβαιότεροι ἂν ἡμῖν ἦσαν μηδὲν νεωτεριεῖν ·
"If indeed we had all been still independent, they might have been better trusted by us not to attempt any innovation:


3.11.1
1803
ὑποχειρίους δὲ ἔχοντες τοὺς πλείους , ἡμῖν δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ὁμιλοῦντες , χαλεπώτερον εἰκότως ἔμελλον οἴσειν καὶ πρὸς τὸ πλέον ἤδη εἶκον τοῦ ἡμετέρου ἔτι μόνου ἀντισουμένου , ἄλλως τε καὶ ὅσῳ δυνατώτεροι αὐτοὶ αὑτῶν ἐγίγνοντο καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐρημότεροι .
but having the majority subject to them, while they associated with us on terms of equality; and comparing the submission of the greater part with our alone being treated as equals, they would naturally brook it the worse; especially as they were themselves growing more powerful than ever, and we more destitute.


3.11.2
1804
τὸ δὲ ἀντίπαλον δέος μόνον πιστὸν ἐς ξυμμαχίαν ·
But equality of fear is the only sure basis of an alliance;


3.11.2
1805
ὁ γὰρ παραβαίνειν τι βουλόμενος τῷ μὴ προύχων ἂν ἐπελθεῖν ἀποτρέπεται .
for then the party that wishes to commit any offence is deterred by the knowledge that he would not attempt it with any advantage on his side.


3.11.3
1806
αὐτόνομοί τε ἐλείφθημεν οὐ δι’ ἄλλο τι ἢ ὅσον αὐτοῖς ἐς τὴν ἀρχὴν εὐπρεπείᾳ τε λόγου καὶ γνώμης μᾶλλον ἐφόδῳ ἢ ἰσχύος τὰ πράγματα ἐφαίνετο καταληπτά .
Again, we were left independent for no other reason than inasmuch as their schemes of empire appeared attainable by specious language, and encroachment in the way of policy rather than of force.


3.11.4
1807
ἅμα μὲν γὰρ μαρτυρίῳ ἐχρῶντο μὴ ἂν τούς γε ἰσοψήφους ἄκοντας , εἰ μή τι ἠδίκουν οἷς ἐπῇσαν , ξυστρατεύειν ·
For at the same time they used us as evidence that such as had equal votes with themselves, at any rate, would not join them in their enterprises against their will; [and therefore not at all,] unless those they attacked were in the wrong:


3.11.4
1808
ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ δὲ καὶ τὰ κράτιστα ἐπί τε τοὺς ὑποδεεστέρους πρώτους ξυνεπῆγον καὶ τὰ τελευταῖα λιπόντες τοῦ ἄλλου περιῃρημένου ἀσθενέστερα ἔμελλον ἕξειν .
and by the same system they also led the stronger states with them against the weaker ones first, and by leaving the more powerful until the last they were sure to find them less so, when all the rest had been stripped away from them.


3.11.5
1809
εἰ δὲ ἀφ’ ἡμῶν ἤρξαντο , ἐχόντων ἔτι τῶν πάντων αὐτῶν τε ἰσχὺν καὶ πρὸς ὅτι χρὴ στῆναι , οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως ἐχειρώσαντο .
But if they had begun with us, while all of them still had their power, and a centre round which to take their stand, they would not have subdued them so easily.


3.11.6
1810
τό τε ναυτικὸν ἡμῶν παρεῖχέ τινα φόβον μή ποτε καθ’ ἓν γενόμενον ἢ ὑμῖν ἢ ἄλλῳ τῳ προσθέμενον κίνδυνον σφίσι παράσχῃ .
Our fleet, too, caused them a degree of fear, lest by uniting together, and joining either you or any other power, it might some time bring them into danger.


3.11.7
1811
τὰ δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ θεραπείας τοῦ τε κοινοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν αἰεὶ προεστώτων περιεγιγνόμεθα .
And again, to a certain extent we preserved ourselves by paying court to their commons, and to those who from time to time took the lead of them.


3.11.8
1812
οὐ μέντοι ἐπὶ πολύ γ’ ἂν ἐδοκοῦμεν δυνηθῆναι , εἰ μὴ ὁ πόλεμος ὅδε κατέστη , παραδείγμασι χρώμενοι τοῖς ἐς τοὺς ἄλλους .
We did not, however, expect to be long able to do so, if this war had not broken out; looking to the examples they had given in their dealings with the rest.


3.12.1
1813
τίς οὖν αὕτη ἢ φιλία ἐγίγνετο ἢ ἐλευθερία πιστή , ἐν ᾗ παρὰ γνώμην ἀλλήλους ὑπεδεχόμεθα , καὶ οἱ μὲν ἡμᾶς ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ δεδιότες ἐθεράπευον , ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐκείνους ἐν τῇ ἡσυχίᾳ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐποιοῦμεν ·
"What then was that alliance of ours, or that freedom to be relied on, in which we received each other contrary to our real sentiments; and they, through fear, courted us in war, while we did the same to them in peace?


3.12.1
1814
ὅ τε τοῖς ἄλλοις μάλιστα εὔνοια πίστιν βεβαιοῖ , ἡμῖν τοῦτο ὁ φόβος ἐχυρὸν παρεῖχε , δέει τε τὸ πλέον ἢ φιλίᾳ κατεχόμενοι ξύμμαχοι ἦμεν ·
And whereas in the case of others it is kindness that most secures faith, in our case it was fear that gave this assurance; and we were constrained to be allies by terror more than by affection;


3.12.1
1815
καὶ ὁποτέροις θᾶσσον παράσχοι ἀσφάλεια θάρσος ,οὗτοι πρότεροί τι καὶ παραβήσεσθαι ἔμελλον .
and to whichever party security should first give confidence, that party was sure to be the first also to violate the treaty in some way or other.


3.12.2
1816
ὥστε εἴ τῳ δοκοῦμεν ἀδικεῖν προαποστάντες διὰ τὴν ἐκείνων μέλλησιν τῶν ἐς ἡμᾶς δεινῶν , αὐτοὶ οὐκ ἀνταναμείναντες σαφῶς εἰδέναι εἴ τι αὐτῶν ἔσται , οὐκ ὀρθῶς σκοπεῖ .
If therefore we are thought by any one to be wrong in first revolting, because they deferred the evils we dreaded, while we did not wait in return to see whether any of them would be inflicted, he does not view the case aright.


3.12.3
1817
εἰ γὰρ δυνατοὶ ἦμεν ἐκ τοῦ ἴσου καὶ ἀντεπιβουλεῦσαι καὶ ἀντιμελλῆσαι , τί ἔδει ἡμᾶς ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου ἐπ’ ἐκείνοις εἶναι ;
For if we were able on equal terms with them to return their plots against us, and their delay in the execution of them, what reason was there, that being, [according to this view of the case,] on an equal footing, we should [really] be at their mercy?


3.12.3
1818
ἐπ’ ἐκείνοις δὲ ὄντος αἰεὶ τοῦ ἐπιχειρεῖν καὶ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν εἶναι δεῖ τὸ προαμύνασθαι .
But as it was always in  power to make the attempt, it ought to be in  to guard against it beforehand.


3.13.1
1819
&quot; τοιαύτας ἔχοντες προφάσεις καὶ αἰτίας , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ ξύμμαχοι , ἀπέστημεν , σαφεῖς μὲν τοῖς ἀκούουσι γνῶναι ὡς εἰκότως ἐδράσαμεν , ἱκανὰς δὲ ἡμᾶς ἐκφοβῆσαι καὶ πρὸς ἀσφάλειάν τινα τρέψαι , βουλομένους μὲν καὶ πάλαι , ὅτε ἔτι ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ ἐπέμψαμεν ὡς ὑμᾶς περὶ ἀποστάσεως , ὑμῶν δὲ οὐ προσδεξαμένων κωλυθέντας ·
"It was on such grounds and with such reasons, Lacedaemonians and allies, that we revolted; sufficiently clear ones for those who hear them to judge that we acted rightly; and sufficiently strong ones to alarm us, and make us betake ourselves to some means of safety:


3.13.1
1820
νῦν δὲ ἐπειδὴ Βοιωτοὶ προυκαλέσαντο εὐθὺς ὑπηκούσαμεν , καὶ ἐνομίζομεν ἀποστήσεσθαι διπλῆν ἀπόστασιν , ἀπό τε τῶν Ἑλλήνων μὴ ξὺν κακῶς ποιεῖν αὐτοὺς μετ’ Ἀθηναίων ἀλλὰ ξυνελευθεροῦν , ἀπό τε Ἀθηναίων μὴ αὐτοὶ διαφθαρῆναι ὑπ’ ἐκείνων ἐν ὑστέρῳ ἀλλὰ προποιῆσαι .
which indeed we wished to do long ago, when we sent to you, while the peace yet lasted, on the subject of our revolting, but were prevented by your not receiving us into alliance. But now, when the Boeotians invited us, we immediately listened to their proposals; and thought that we should withdraw ourselves in a twofold manner; front the Greeks, so as not to join in injuring them in company with the Athenians, but to join in giving them liberty;


3.13.2
1821
ἡ μέντοι ἀπόστασις ἡμῶν θᾶσσον γεγένηται καὶ ἀπαράσκευος ·
and from the Athenians, so as not to be ruined by them ourselves after the rest, but to be beforehand in acting [against them Our revolt, however, has taken place prematurely, and without due preparations;


3.13.2
1822
ᾗ καὶ μᾶλλον χρὴ ξυμμάχους δεξαμένους ἡμᾶς διὰ ταχέων βοήθειαν ἀποστέλλειν , ἵνα φαίνησθε ἀμύνοντές τε οἷς δεῖ καὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ τοὺς πολεμίους βλάπτοντες .
for which reason also it is the more incumbent on you to receive us as allies, and send us succour speedily;


3.13.3
1823
καιρὸς δὲ ὡς οὔπω πρότερον .
that you may be seen both assisting those whom you ought, and at the same time hurting your enemies.


3.13.3
1824
νόσῳ τε γὰρ ἐφθάραται Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ χρημάτων δαπάνῃ , νῆές τε αὐτοῖς αἱ μὲν περὶ τὴν ὑμετέραν εἰσίν , αἱ δ’ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν τετάχαται .
And there is an opportunity for doing that, such as there never was before; for the Athenians have been wasted both by disease and pecuniary expenditure; and their ships are either cruising round your coasts, or stationed against us;


3.13.4
1825
ὥστε οὐκ εἰκὸς αὐτοὺς περιουσίαν νεῶν ἔχειν , ἢν ὑμεῖς ἐν τῷ θέρει τῷδε ναυσί τε καὶ πεζῷ ἅμα ἐπεσβάλητε τὸ δεύτερον , ἀλλ’ ἢ ὑμᾶς οὐκ ἀμυνοῦνται ἐπιπλέοντας ἢ ἀπ’ ἀμφοτέρων ἀποχωρήσονται .
so that it is not likely they should have any to spare, if in the course of this summer you should invade them a second time both by sea and land; but they will either offer no resistance to your naval attack, or withdraw their forces from both our shores.


3.13.5
1826
νομίσῃ τε μηδεὶς ἀλλοτρίας γῆς πέρι οἰκεῖον κίνδυνον ἕξειν .
And let no one deem that he would thus be incurring peril to himself in defence of another man's country.


3.13.5
1827
ᾧ γὰρ δοκεῖ μακρὰν ἀπεῖναι ἡ Λέσβος , τὴν ὠφελίαν αὐτῷ ἐγγύθεν παρέξει .
For whoever thinks Lesbos far off, will find it close at hand for assisting him.


3.13.5
1828
οὐ γὰρ ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ἔσται ὁ πόλεμος , ὥς τις οἴεται , ἀλλὰ δι’ ἣν ἡ Ἀττικὴ ὠφελεῖται .
For it is not in Attica that the war will be decided, as men imagine, but in that quarter from which Attica derives its succours.


3.13.6
1829
ἔστι δὲ τῶν χρημάτων ἀπὸ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἡ πρόσοδος , καὶ ἔτι μείζων ἔσται , εἰ ἡμᾶς καταστρέψονται ·
Now their revenue is drawn from their allies; and it will be still greater, if they subdue us;


3.13.6
1830
οὔτε γὰρ ἀποστήσεται ἄλλος τά τε ἡμέτερα προσγενήσεται , πάθοιμέν τ’ ἂν δεινότερα ἢ οἱ πρὶν δουλεύοντες .
for no one else will revolt, and our resources will be added to theirs; and we should be treated worse than those who were enslaved before [they revolted].


3.13.7
1831
βοηθησάντων δὲ ὑμῶν προθύμως πόλιν τε προσλήψεσθε ναυτικὸν ἔχουσαν μέγα , οὗπερ ὑμῖν μάλιστα προσδεῖ , καὶ Ἀθηναίους ῥᾷον καθαιρήσετε ὑφαιροῦντες αὐτῶν τοὺς ξυμμάχους ( θρασύτερον γὰρ πᾶς τις προσχωρήσεται ) , τήν τε αἰτίαν ἀποφεύξεσθε ἣν εἴχετε μὴ βοηθεῖν τοῖς ἀφισταμένοις .
But if you will give us hearty assistance, you will both add to your league a state that has a large navy, of which you especially stand in need, and will the more easily overthrow the Athenians, by depriving them of their allies, (for every one will then join you more boldly,) and will escape the charge you have incurred of not assisting those who revolt.


3.13.7
1832
ἢν δ’ ἐλευθεροῦντες φαίνησθε , τὸ κράτος τοῦ πολέμου βεβαιότερον ἕξετε .
If, however, you show yourselves as liberators, you will find your advantage in the war more certain.


3.14.1
1833
&quot; αἰσχυνθέντες οὖν τάς τε τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐς ὑμᾶς ἐλπίδας καὶ Δία τὸν Ὀλύμπιον , ἐν οὗ τῷ ἱερῷ ἴσα καὶ ἱκέται ἐσμέν , ἐπαμύνατε Μυτιληναίοις ξύμμαχοι γενόμενοι , καὶ μὴ προῆσθε ἡμᾶς ἴδιον μὲν τὸν κίνδυνον τῶν σωμάτων παραβαλλομένους , κοινὴν δὲ τὴν ἐκ τοῦ κατορθῶσαι ὠφελίαν ἅπασι δώσοντας , ἔτι δὲ κοινοτέραν τὴν βλάβην , εἰ μὴ πεισθέντων ὑμῶν σφαλησόμεθα .
" From respect then for the hopes of the Greeks reposed in you, and for that Olympian Jupiter in whose temple we stand in the character of suppliants, assist the Mytilenaeans by becoming their allies;"


3.14.2
1834
γίγνεσθε δὲ ἄνδρες οἵουσπερ ὑμᾶς οἵ τε Ἕλληνες ἀξιοῦσι καὶ τὸ ἡμέτερον δέος βούλεται &quot; .
" and do not abandon us [to destruction], standing as we do the brunt of the danger in our own persons, while we shall confer on all a general benefit from our success, and a still more general detriment, if we are ruined through your not being prevailed on to help us Show yourselves then to be such men as the Greeks esteem you, and as our fear would have you to be."


3.15.1
1835
τοιαῦτα μὲν οἱ Μυτιληναῖοι εἶπον .
To this effect spoke the Mytilenaeans.


3.15.1
1836
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐπειδὴ ἤκουσαν , προσδεξάμενοι τοὺς λόγους ξυμμάχους τε τοὺς Λεσβίους ἐποιήσαντο , καὶ τὴν ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐσβολὴν τοῖς τε ξυμμάχοις παροῦσι κατὰ τάχος ἔφραζον ἰέναι ἐς τὸν Ἰσθμὸν τοῖς δύο μέρεσιν ὡς ποιησόμενοι , καὶ αὐτοὶ πρῶτοι ἀφίκοντο , καὶ ὁλκοὺς παρεσκεύαζον τῶν νεῶν ἐν τῷ Ἰσθμῷ ὡς ὑπεροίσοντες ἐκ τῆς Κορίνθου ἐς τὴν πρὸς Ἀθήνας θάλασσαν καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ ἅμα ἐπιόντες .
When the Lacedaemonians and the confederates had heard them, they admitted the force of their arguments, and received the Lesbians into alliance. And with regard to the invasion of Attica, they told the confederates who were present to go with all speed to the isthmus with two thirds of their forces, to put it into execution, and were themselves the first to arrive there, and proceeded to get ready at the isthmus machines for hauling their ships with a view to transporting them from Corinth to the sea on the side of Athens, and making an attack both by sea and land at the same time.


3.15.2
1837
καὶ οἱ μὲν προθύμως ταῦτα ἔπρασσον , οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ξύμμαχοι βραδέως τε ξυνελέγοντο καὶ ἐν καρποῦ ξυγκομιδῇ ἦσαν καὶ ἀρρωστίᾳ τοῦ στρατεύειν .
They, then, were heartily engaged in those operations; but the rest of the confederates were slow in assembling, as they were occupied in gathering in their harvest, and sick of making expeditions.


3.16.1
1838
αἰσθόμενοι δὲ αὐτοὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι διὰ κατάγνωσιν ἀσθενείας σφῶν παρασκευαζομένους , δηλῶσαι βουλόμενοι ὅτι οὐκ ὀρθῶς ἐγνώκασιν ἀλλ’ οἷοί τέ εἰσι μὴ κινοῦντες τὸ ἐπὶ Λέσβῳ ναυτικὸν καὶ τὸ ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου ἐπιὸν ῥᾳδίως ἀμύνεσθαι , ἐπλήρωσαν ναῦς ἑκατὸν ἐσβάντες αὐτοί τε πλὴν ἱππέων καὶ πεντακοσιομεδίμνων καὶ οἱ μέτοικοι , καὶ παρὰ τὸν Ἰσθμὸν ἀναγαγόντες ἐπίδειξίν τε ἐποιοῦντο καὶ ἀποβάσεις τῆς Πελοποννήσου ᾗ δοκοίη αὐτοῖς .
The Athenians were aware that they were making these preparations from a conviction of their weakness; and wishing to show that it was not a correct opinion, but that they were able, without moving the squadron stationed against Lesbos, at the same time to repel with ease that which was coming against them from the Peloponnese, they manned a hundred ships, going on board themselves, (with the exception of the knights and the) and their resident aliens; and having put out to the isthmus, they made both a display [of their power], and descents on whatever parts of the Peloponnese they pleased.


3.16.2
1839
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ὁρῶντες πολὺν τὸν παράλογον τά τε ὑπὸ τῶν Λεσβίων ῥηθέντα ἡγοῦντο οὐκ ἀληθῆ καὶ ἄπορα νομίζοντες , ὡς αὐτοῖς καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἅμα οὐ παρῆσαν καὶ ἠγγέλλοντο καὶ αἱ περὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον τριάκοντα νῆες τῶν Ἀθηναίων τὴν περιοικίδα αὐτῶν πορθοῦσαι , ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
When the Lacedaemonians saw things so contrary to their expectation, they thought that what had been told them by the Lesbians was not true; and considering themselves in a strait, as their allies at the same time had not joined them, and the thirty Athenian ships cruising round the Peloponnese were reported to be ravaging the land near their city, they returned home.


3.16.3
1840
ὕστερον δὲ ναυτικὸν παρεσκεύαζον ὅτι πέμψουσιν ἐς τὴν Λέσβον , καὶ κατὰ πόλεις ἐπήγγελλον τεσσαράκοντα νεῶν πλῆθος καὶ ναύαρχον προσέταξαν Ἀλκίδαν , ὃς ἔμελλεν ἐπιπλεύσεσθαι .
Afterwards, however, they prepared a fleet to send to Lesbos, and gave orders to the different states for ships to the number of forty, and appointed Alcidas, who was to conduct the expedition, their high-admiral.


3.16.4
1841
ἀνεχώρησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ταῖς ἑκατὸν ναυσίν , ἐπειδὴ καὶ ἐκείνους εἶδον .
The Athenians, too, returned with their hundred ships, when they saw that the Lacedaemonians had done so.


3.17.1
1842
καὶ κατὰ τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον ὃν αἱ νῆες ἔπλεον ἐν τοῖς πλεῖσται δὴ νῆες ἅμ’ αὐτοῖς ἐνεργοὶ † κάλλει ἐγένοντο , παραπλήσιαι δὲ καὶ ἔτι πλείους ἀρχομένου τοῦ πολέμου .
At the time that this squadron was at sea, they had about the largest number of ships they had ever possessed at once, in effective and fine condition : (though they had as many, or even more, at the beginning of the war.)


3.17.2
1843
τήν τε γὰρ Ἀττικὴν καὶ Εὔβοιαν καὶ Σαλαμῖνα ἑκατὸν ἐφύλασσον , καὶ περὶ Πελοπόννησον ἕτεραι ἑκατὸν ἦσαν , χωρὶς δὲ αἱ περὶ Ποτείδαιαν καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις χωρίοις , ὥστε αἱ πᾶσαι ἅμα ἐγίγνοντο ἐν ἑνὶ θέρει διακόσιαι καὶ πεντήκοντα .
For a hundred kept guard round Attica, Euboea, and Salamis, while another hundred were cruising about the Peloponnese, besides those at Potidaea and in other places; so that altogether there were two hundred and fifty [in service] in the course of that one summer. And it was this, in conjunction with Potidaea, that most exhausted their revenues.


3.17.3
1844
καὶ τὰ χρήματα τοῦτο μάλιστα ὑπανήλωσε μετὰ Ποτειδαίας .
For at Potidaea the number of heavy-armed that kept guard at two drachmas a day,


3.17.4
1845
τήν τε γὰρ Ποτείδαιαν δίδραχμοι ὁπλῖται ἐφρούρουν ( αὑτῷ γὰρ καὶ ὑπηρέτῃ δραχμὴν ἐλάμβανε τῆς ἡμέρας ) , τρισχίλιοι μὲν οἱ πρῶτοι , ὧν οὐκ ἐλάσσους διεπολιόρκησαν , ἑξακόσιοι δὲ καὶ χίλιοι μετὰ Φορμίωνος , οἳ προαπῆλθον ·
(for each man received one for himself and another for his servant,) was at first three thousand; and not fewer than these remained there to the end of the siege, besides one thousand six hundred with Phormio, who went away before it was concluded


3.17.4
1846
νῆές τε αἱ πᾶσαι τὸν αὐτὸν μισθὸν ἔφερον .
while all the ships, too, received the same pay.


3.17.4
1847
τὰ μὲν οὖν χρήματα οὕτως ὑπανηλώθη τὸ πρῶτον , καὶ νῆες τοσαῦται δὴ πλεῖσται ἐπληρώθησαν .
In this way then was their money heedlessly lavished at first; and such was the largest number of ships manned by them.


3.18.1
1848
Μυτιληναῖοι δὲ κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον ὃν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι περὶ τὸν Ἰσθμὸν ἦσαν ἐπὶ Μήθυμναν ὡς προδιδομένην ἐστράτευσαν κατὰ γῆν αὐτοί τε καὶ οἱ ἐπίκουροι ·
At the same time that the Lacedaemonians were in the neighbourhood of the isthmus, the Mytilenaeans marched by land, both themselves and their auxiliaries, against Methymna, in hope of its being betrayed to them.


3.18.1
1849
καὶ προσβαλόντες τῇ πόλει , ἐπειδὴ οὐ προυχώρει ᾗ προσεδέχοντο , ἀπῆλθον ἐπ’ Ἀντίσσης καὶ Πύρρας καὶ Ἐρέσου , καὶ καταστησάμενοι τὰ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι ταύταις βεβαιότερα καὶ τείχη κρατύναντες διὰ τάχους ἀπῆλθον ἐπ’ οἴκου .
After assaulting the city, when they did not succeed as they had expected to do, they withdrew to Antissa, Pyrrha, and Eresus, and having rendered the condition of those towns more secure, and strengthened the fortifications, they returned home.


3.18.2
1850
ἐστράτευσαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Μηθυμναῖοι ἀναχωρησάντων αὐτῶν ἐπ’ Ἄντισσαν ·
When they had retired, the Methymnaeans marched against Antissa;


3.18.2
1851
καὶ ἐκβοηθείας τινὸς γενομένης πληγέντες ὑπό τε τῶν Ἀντισσαίων καὶ τῶν ἐπικούρων ἀπέθανόν τε πολλοὶ καὶ ἀνεχώρησαν οἱ λοιποὶ κατὰ τάχος .
and being defeated by the inhabitants and their auxiliaries in a sortie that was made, many of them were slain, and the remainder retreated as quickly as possible.


3.18.3
1852
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι πυνθανόμενοι ταῦτα , τούς τε Μυτιληναίους τῆς γῆς κρατοῦντας καὶ τοὺς σφετέρους στρατιώτας οὐχ ἱκανοὺς ὄντας εἴργειν , πέμπουσι περὶ τὸ φθινόπωρον ἤδη ἀρχόμενον Πάχητα τὸν Ἐπικούρου στρατηγὸν καὶ χιλίους ὁπλίτας ἑαυτῶν .
The Athenians, on receiving this intelligence of the Mytilenaeans' commanding the country, and their own troops not being sufficient to keep them in check, sent, about the beginning of autumn, Paches son of Epicurus as commander, with a thousand heavy-armed of their own;


3.18.4
1853
οἱ δὲ αὐτερέται πλεύσαντες τῶν νεῶν ἀφικνοῦνται καὶ περιτειχίζουσι Μυτιλήνην ἐν κύκλῳ ἁπλῷ τείχει ·
who having themselves rowed their ships, arrived at Mytilene, and enclosed it all round with a single wall;


3.18.4
1854
φρούρια δ’ ἔστιν ᾗ ἐπὶ τῶν καρτερῶν ἐγκατῳκοδόμηται .
forts being built on some of the strongest points of it.


3.18.5
1855
καὶ ἡ μὲν Μυτιλήνη κατὰ κράτος ἤδη ἀμφοτέρωθεν καὶ ἐκ γῆς καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης εἴργετο , καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἤρχετο γίγνεσθαι .
Thus the place was vigorously blockaded on both sides, by land and by sea; and the commencement of winter was near at hand.


3.19.1
1856
προσδεόμενοι δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι χρημάτων ἐς τὴν πολιορκίαν , καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐσενεγκόντες τότε πρῶτον ἐσφορὰν διακόσια τάλαντα , ἐξέπεμψαν καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀργυρολόγους ναῦς δώδεκα καὶ Λυσικλέα πέμπτον αὐτὸν στρατηγόν .
The Athenians, being in want of money for the siege, although they had among themselves for the first time raised a contribution of two hundred talents, despatched to their allies also twelve ships to levy subsidies, and Lysicles with five others in command of them.


3.19.2
1857
ὁ δὲ ἄλλα τε ἠργυρολόγει καὶ περιέπλει , καὶ τῆς Καρίας ἐκ Μυοῦντος ἀναβὰς διὰ τοῦ Μαιάνδρου πεδίου μέχρι τοῦ Σανδίου λόφου , ἐπιθεμένων τῶν Καρῶν καὶ Ἀναιιτῶν αὐτός τε διαφθείρεται καὶ τῆς ἄλλης στρατιᾶς πολλοί .
Accordingly he levied them in various places, cruising about; and having gone up the country from Myus in Caria, across the plain of the Maeander, as far as the hill of Sandius, he was both slain himself and many of the army besides, in an attack made by the Carians and the people of Anaea.


3.20.1
1858
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος οἱ Πλαταιῆς ( ἔτι γὰρ ἐπολιορκοῦντο ὑπὸ τῶν Πελοποννησίων καὶ Βοιωτῶν ) ἐπειδὴ τῷ τε σίτῳ ἐπιλείποντι ἐπιέζοντο καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν οὐδεμία ἐλπὶς ἦν τιμωρίας οὐδὲ ἄλλη σωτηρία ἐφαίνετο , ἐπιβουλεύουσιν αὐτοί τε καὶ Ἀθηναίων οἱ ξυμπολιορκούμενοι πρῶτον μὲν πάντες ἐξελθεῖν καὶ ὑπερβῆναι τὰ τείχη τῶν πολεμίων , ἢν δύνωνται βιάσασθαι , ἐσηγησαμένων τὴν πεῖραν αὐτοῖς Θεαινέτου τε τοῦ Τολμίδου ἀνδρὸς μάντεως καὶ Εὐπομπίδου τοῦ Δαϊμάχου , ὃς καὶ ἐστρατήγει ·
The same winter the Plataeans, (for they were still besieged by the Peloponnesians and Boeotians,) when distressed by the failure of their provisions, and when there was no hope of aid from Attica, and no other means of safety presented itself, both themselves and the Athenians who were besieged with them formed a design, in which they were at first unanimous, for all to sally forth and pass the walls of the enemy, if they could force their way over them; the attempt having been suggested to them by Theaenetus son of Tolmidas, a soothsayer, and Eupomidas son of Daïmachus, who was also one of their generals.


3.20.2
1859
ἔπειτα οἱ μὲν ἡμίσεις ἀπώκνησάν πως τὸν κίνδυνον μέγαν ἡγησάμενοι , ἐς δὲ ἄνδρας διακοσίους καὶ εἴκοσι μάλιστα ἐνέμειναν τῇ ἐξόδῳ ἐθελονταὶ τρόπῳ τοιῷδε .
Subsequently half of them shrank from it, thinking it a great risk; but about two hundred and twenty voluntarily persevered in the attempt, [which they effected] in the following manner.


3.20.3
1860
κλίμακας ἐποιήσαντο ἴσας τῷ τείχει τῶν πολεμίων ·
They made ladders to suit the height of the enemy's wall,


3.20.3
1861
ξυνεμετρήσαντο δὲ ταῖς ἐπιβολαῖς τῶν πλίνθων , ᾗ ἔτυχε πρὸς σφᾶς οὐκ ἐξαληλιμμένον τὸ τεῖχος αὐτῶν .
measuring by the layers of bricks, where the wall looking toward them happened to be imperfectly whitewashed.


3.20.3
1862
ἠριθμοῦντο δὲ πολλοὶ ἅμα τὰς ἐπιβολάς , καὶ ἔμελλον οἱ μέν τινες ἁμαρτήσεσθαι οἱ δὲ πλείους τεύξεσθαι τοῦ ἀληθοῦς λογισμοῦ , ἄλλως τε καὶ πολλάκις ἀριθμοῦντες καὶ ἅμα οὐ πολὺ ἀπέχοντες , ἀλλὰ ῥᾳδίως καθορωμένου ἐς ὃ ἐβούλοντο τοῦ τείχους .
Now many counted the layers at the same time; and though some would naturally miss the correct calculation, the majority would attain it; especially as they counted them many times over, and were also at no great distance, but the wall was easily observed by them as far as they wished.


3.20.4
1863
τὴν μὲν οὖν ξυμμέτρησιν τῶν κλιμάκων οὕτως ἔλαβον , ἐκ τοῦ πάχους τῆς πλίνθου εἰκάσαντες τὸ μέτρον .
In this way they ascertained the proper length of the ladders, guessing the measure from the thickness of the bricks.


3.21.1
1864
τὸ δὲ τεῖχος ἦν τῶν Πελοποννησίων τοιόνδε τῇ οἰκοδομήσει .
Now the wall of the Peloponnesians was of the following construction.


3.21.1
1865
εἶχε μὲν δύο τοὺς περιβόλους , πρός τε Πλαταιῶν καὶ εἴ τις ἔξωθεν ἀπ’ Ἀθηνῶν ἐπίοι , διεῖχον δὲ οἱ περίβολοι ἑκκαίδεκα πόδας μάλιστα ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων .
It consisted of two lines round the place, one against the Plataeans, and another in case any one should attack them on the outside from Athens; and the lines were about sixteen feet apart.


3.21.2
1866
τὸ οὖν μεταξὺ τοῦτο οἱ ἑκκαίδεκα πόδες τοῖς φύλαξιν οἰκήματα διανενεμημένα ᾠκοδόμητο , καὶ ἦν ξυνεχῆ ὥστε ἓν φαίνεσθαι τεῖχος παχὺ ἐπάλξεις ἔχον ἀμφοτέρωθεν .
In this interval then of the sixteen feet there were quarters built, and partitioned out amongst the soldiers that were on guard; and these were continuous, so that it appeared but one thick wall, with battlements on each side.


3.21.3
1867
διὰ δέκα δὲ ἐπάλξεων πύργοι ἦσαν μεγάλοι καὶ ἰσοπλατεῖς τῷ τείχει , διήκοντες ἔς τε τὸ ἔσω μέτωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ αὐτοὶ καὶ τὸ ἔξω , ὥστε πάροδον μὴ εἶναι παρὰ πύργον , ἀλλὰ δι’ αὐτῶν μέσων διῇσαν .
At the distance of every ten battlements there were towers, of considerable size, and of the same breadth as the wall, reaching both to its inner and its outer front, so that there was no passage by the side of a tower, but they passed through the middle of them.


3.21.4
1868
τὰς οὖν νύκτας , ὁπότε χειμὼν εἴη νοτερός , τὰς μὲν ἐπάλξεις ἀπέλειπον , ἐκ δὲ τῶν πύργων ὄντων δι’ ὀλίγου καὶ ἄνωθεν στεγανῶν τὴν φυλακὴν ἐποιοῦντο .
During the nights therefore, whenever it was stormy and wet weather, they used to leave the battlements, and to keep watch from the towers, as they were only at a short distance one from another, and were covered in above.


3.21.4
1869
τὸ μὲν οὖν τεῖχος ᾧ περιεφρουροῦντο οἱ Πλαταιῆς τοιοῦτον ἦν .
Such then was the nature of the wall by which the Plataeans were enclosed.


3.22.1
1870
οἱ δ’ , ἐπειδὴ παρεσκεύαστο αὐτοῖς , τηρήσαντες νύκτα χειμέριον ὕδατι καὶ ἀνέμῳ καὶ ἅμ’ ἀσέληνον ἐξῇσαν ·
When they had made their preparations, having watched for a stormy night of wind and rain, and at the same time moonless, they went forth under the guidance of those who had been the authors of the enterprise.


3.22.1
1871
ἡγοῦντο δὲ οἵπερ καὶ τῆς πείρας αἴτιοι ἦσαν .
In the first place then they crossed the ditch which ran round their city,


3.22.1
1872
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν τὴν τάφρον διέβησαν ἣ περιεῖχεν αὐτούς , ἔπειτα προσέμειξαν τῷ τείχει τῶν πολεμίων λαθόντες τοὺς φύλακας , ἀνὰ τὸ σκοτεινὸν μὲν οὐ προϊδόντων αὐτῶν , ψόφῳ δὲ τῷ ἐκ τοῦ προσιέναι αὐτοὺς ἀντιπαταγοῦντος τοῦ ἀνέμου οὐ κατακουσάντων ·
and then came up to the enemy's wall, unperceived by the sentinels; for they did not see before them in the dark, and did not hear them owing to the wind, which drowned with its clatter the noise of their approach;


3.22.2
1873
ἅμα δὲ καὶ διέχοντες πολὺ ᾖσαν , ὅπως τὰ ὅπλα μὴ κρουόμενα πρὸς ἄλληλα αἴσθησιν παρέχοι .
besides, they went far apart from each other, that their arms might not clash together and betray them.


3.22.2
1874
ἦσαν δὲ εὐσταλεῖς τε τῇ ὁπλίσει καὶ τὸν ἀριστερὸν μόνον πόδα ὑποδεδεμένοι ἀσφαλείας ἕνεκα τῆς πρὸς τὸν πηλόν .
They were also lightly armed, and had only the left foot shod, for security against slipping in the mire.


3.22.3
1875
κατὰ οὖν μεταπύργιον προσέμισγον πρὸς τὰς ἐπάλξεις , εἰδότες ὅτι ἐρῆμοί εἰσι , πρῶτον μὲν οἱ τὰς κλίμακας φέροντες , καὶ προσέθεσαν ·
So they came up to the battlements at one of the spaces between the towers, knowing that they were deserted. First came those who carried the ladders, which they planted;


3.22.3
1876
ἔπειτα ψιλοὶ δώδεκα ξὺν ξιφιδίῳ καὶ θώρακι ἀνέβαινον , ὧν ἡγεῖτο Ἀμμέας ὁ Κοροίβου καὶ πρῶτος ἀνέβη ·
then twelve light-armed, with only a dagger and a breastplate, proceeded to mount, Ammias son of Coroebus leading them, and being the first to mount,


3.22.3
1877
μετὰ δὲ αὐτὸν οἱ ἑπόμενοι , ἓξ ἐφ’ ἑκάτερον τῶν πύργων , ἀνέβαινον .
and after him his followers, six going to each of the towers.


3.22.3
1878
ἔπειτα ψιλοὶ ἄλλοι μετὰ τούτους ξὺν δορατίοις ἐχώρουν , οἷς ἕτεροι κατόπιν τὰς ἀσπίδας ἔφερον , ὅπως ἐκεῖνοι ῥᾷον προσβαίνοιεν , καὶ ἔμελλον δώσειν ὁπότε πρὸς τοῖς πολεμίοις εἶεν .
Next after them came another party of light-armed, with darts, whose shields, that they might the more easily advance, others carried in the rear, and were ready to hand them to them whenever they came to the enemy.


3.22.4
1879
ὡς δὲ ἄνω πλείους ἐγένοντο , ᾔσθοντο οἱ ἐκ τῶν πύργων φύλακες ·
When a considerable number had got up, the sentinels in the towers discovered it;


3.22.4
1880
κατέβαλε γάρ τις τῶν Πλαταιῶν ἀντιλαμβανόμενος ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπάλξεων κεραμίδα , ἣ πεσοῦσα δοῦπον ἐποίησεν .
for one of the Plataeans, in laying hold of the battlements, threw down a tile from them, which made a noise as it fell.


3.22.5
1881
καὶ αὐτίκα βοὴ ἦν , τὸ δὲ στρατόπεδον ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος ὥρμησεν ·
And immediately a shout was raised, and the troops rushed to the wall,


3.22.5
1882
οὐ γὰρ ᾔδει ὅτι ἦν τὸ δεινὸν σκοτεινῆς νυκτὸς καὶ χειμῶνος ὄντος , καὶ ἅμα οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει τῶν Πλαταιῶν ὑπολελειμμένοι ἐξελθόντες προσέβαλον τῷ τείχει τῶν Πελοποννησίων ἐκ τ- ἔμπαλιν ἢ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτῶν ὑπερέβαινον , ὅπως ἥκιστα πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὸν νοῦν ἔχοιεν .
for they did not know what the alarm was, the night being dark, and the weather stormy; and besides, those of the Plataeans who had been left behind in the town sallied forth, and made an attack on the wall of the Peloponnesians on the opposite side to where their men were getting over, that they might pay as little attention as possible to them.


3.22.6
1883
ἐθορυβοῦντο μὲν οὖν κατὰ χώραν μένοντες , βοηθεῖν δὲ οὐδεὶς ἐτόλμα ἐκ τῆς ἑαυτῶν φυλακῆς , ἀλλ’ ἐν ἀπόρῳ ἦσαν εἰκάσαι τὸ γιγνόμενον .
Thus, though they were alarmed, and stood to their several posts, no one ventured to go to the rescue beyond his own station, but they were at a loss to conjecture what was going on.


3.22.7
1884
καὶ οἱ τριακόσιοι αὐτῶν , οἷς ἐτέτακτο παραβοηθεῖν εἴ τι δέοι , ἐχώρουν ἔξω τοῦ τείχους πρὸς τὴν βοήν .
Meanwhile their three hundred, whose orders were to give aid at whatever point it might be necessary, proceeded outside the wall in the direction of the shout.


3.22.7
1885
φρυκτοί τε ᾔροντο ἐς τὰς Θήβας πολέμιοι ·
Meanwhile, fire-signals were raised to Thebes by the enemy.


3.22.8
1886
παρανῖσχον δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Πλαταιῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους φρυκτοὺς πολλοὺς πρότερον παρεσκευασμένους ἐς αὐτὸ τοῦτο , ὅπως ἀσαφῆ τὰ σημεῖα τῆς φρυκτωρίας τοῖς πολεμίοις ᾖ καὶ μὴ βοηθοῖεν , ἄλλο τι νομίσαντες τὸ γιγνόμενον εἶναι ἢ τὸ ὄν , πρὶν σφῶν οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ ἐξιόντες διαφύγοιεν καὶ τοῦ ἀσφαλοῦς ἀντιλάβοιντο .
Fire-signals of an attack from the enemy were likewise raised towards Thebes; but the Plataeans in the city also raised many others, which had been prepared beforehand for this purpose, that the indications of the enemy's signals might be indistinct, and so [their friends] might not come to their aid, thinking the business something different from what it really was, till those of their own number who had gone out should have escaped and gained their safety.


3.23.1
1887
οἱ δ’ ὑπερβαίνοντες τῶν Πλαταιῶν ἐν τούτῳ , ὡς οἱ πρῶτοι αὐτῶν ἀνεβεβήκεσαν καὶ τοῦ πύργου ἑκατέρου τοὺς φύλακας διαφθείραντες ἐκεκρατήκεσαν , τάς τε διόδους τῶν πύργων ἐνστάντες αὐτοὶ ἐφύλασσον μηδένα δι’ αὐτῶν ἐπιβοηθεῖν , καὶ κλίμακας προσθέντες ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους τοῖς πύργοις καὶ ἐπαναβιβάσαντες ἄνδρας πλείους , οἱ μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν πύργων τοὺς ἐπιβοηθοῦντας καὶ κάτωθεν καὶ ἄνωθεν εἶργον βάλλοντες , οἱ δ’ ἐν τούτῳ οἱ πλείους πολλὰς προσθέντες κλίμακας ἅμα καὶ τὰς ἐπάλξεις ἀπώσαντες διὰ τοῦ μεταπυργίου ὑπερέβαινον .
In the mean time, with regard to the party of Plataeans that were scaling the wall, when the first of them had mounted, and after putting the sentinels to the sword, had taken possession of each of the two towers, they posted themselves in them, and kept guard, to prevent any reinforcement coming through them; and when they had raised ladders to them from the wall, and sent up a considerable party of men, those at the towers kept in check with their missiles, both from above and below, such as were coming to the rescue; while the other and greater part of them had in the mean time planted many ladders, and thrown down the battlements, and were passing over between the towers.


3.23.2
1888
ὁ δὲ διακομιζόμενος αἰεὶ ἵστατο ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους τῆς τάφρου καὶ ἐντεῦθεν ἐτόξευόν τε καὶ ἠκόντιζον , εἴ τις παραβοηθῶν παρὰ τὸ τεῖχος κωλυτὴς γίγνοιτο τῆς διαβάσεως .
As each successively effected his passage, he took his stand on the edge of the ditch; and thence they used their bows and darts against any one that came to the rescue along the wall, and tried to stop the passage [of their comrades].


3.23.3
1889
ἐπεὶ δὲ πάντες διεπεπεραίωντο , οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πύργων χαλεπῶς οἱ τελευταῖοι καταβαίνοντες ἐχώρουν ἐπὶ τὴν τάφρον , καὶ ἐν τούτῳ οἱ τριακόσιοι αὐτοῖς ἐπεφέροντο λαμπάδας ἔχοντες .
When all were over, those on the towers descended—the last of them with great difficulty— and proceeded to the ditch; and in the mean time the three hundred were coming against them with torches.


3.23.4
1890
οἱ μὲν οὖν Πλαταιῆς ἐκείνους ἑώρων μᾶλλον ἐκ τοῦ σκότους ἑστῶτες ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους τῆς τάφρου , καὶ ἐτόξευόν τε καὶ ἐσηκόντιζον ἐς τὰ γυμνά , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐν τῷ ἀφανεῖ ὄντες ἧσσον διὰ τὰς λαμπάδας καθεωρῶντο , ὥστε φθάνουσι τῶν Πλαταιῶν καὶ οἱ ὕστατοι διαβάντες τὴν τάφρον , χαλεπῶς δὲ καὶ βιαίως ·
Now the Plataeans, as they stood in the dark on the edge of the ditch, had a better view of them, and discharged their arrows and darts against the exposed parts of their bodies; while they themselves, in the obscurity of their position, were the less acen for the torches; so that even the last of the Plataeans got clear over the ditch, though with difficulty and by a violent effort;


3.23.5
1891
κρύσταλλός τε γὰρ ἐπεπήγει οὐ βέβαιος ἐν αὐτῇ ὥστ’ ἐπελθεῖν , ἀλλ’ οἷος ἀπηλιώτου ἢ βορέου ὑδατώδης μᾶλλον , καὶ ἡ νὺξ τοιούτῳ ἀνέμῳ ὑπονειφομένη πολὺ τὸ ὕδωρ ἐν αὐτῇ ἐπεποιήκει , ὃ μόλις ὑπερέχοντες ἐπεραιώθησαν .
for ice had frozen over it, not strong enough to allow of their walking on it, but rather watery, as it usually is with a wind more east than north; and the night being somewhat snowy in consequence of such a wind, had swollen the water in it, which they crossed with their heads barely above it.


3.23.5
1892
ἐγένετο δὲ καὶ ἡ διάφευξις αὐτοῖς μᾶλλον διὰ τοῦ χειμῶνος τὸ μέγεθος .
But at the same time their escape was mainly effected through the violence of the storm.


3.24.1
1893
ὁρμήσαντες δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς τάφρου οἱ Πλαταιῆς ἐχώρουν ἁθρόοι τὴν ἐς Θήβας φέρουσαν ὁδόν , ἐν δεξιᾷ ἔχοντες τὸ τοῦ Ἀνδροκράτους ἡρῷον , νομίζοντες ἥκιστ’ ἂν σφᾶς ταύτην αὐτοὺς ὑποτοπῆσαι τραπέσθαι τὴν ἐς τοὺς πολεμίους ·
Starting from the ditch, the Plataeans went in a body along the road leading to Thebes, keeping the chapel of the hero Androcrates on their right, thinking that the Peloponnesians would least suspect their taking that road, towards their enemies' country;


3.24.1
1894
καὶ ἅμα ἑώρων τοὺς Πελοποννησίους τὴν πρὸς Κιθαιρῶνα καὶ Δρυὸς κεφαλὰς τὴν ἐπ’ Ἀθηνῶν φέρουσαν μετὰ λαμπάδων διώκοντας .
and in the meantime they saw them in pursuit with torches along the road to Cithaeron and the Oak-heads, in the direction of Athens.


3.24.2
1895
καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν ἓξ ἢ ἑπτὰ σταδίους οἱ Πλαταιῆς τὴν ἐπὶ τῶν Θηβῶν ἐχώρησαν , ἔπειθ’ ὑποστρέψαντες ᾖσαν τὴν πρὸς τὸ ὄρος φέρουσαν ὁδὸν ἐς Ἐρύθρας καὶ Ὑσιάς , καὶ λαβόμενοι τῶν ὀρῶν διαφεύγουσιν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας , ἄνδρες δώδεκα καὶ διακόσιοι ἀπὸ πλειόνων ·
So after they had gone six or seven stades along the road to Thebes, they then turned off, and took that which leads to the mountain, to Erythrae, and Hysiae; and having reached the hills, they escaped to Athens, to the number of two hundred and twelve out of one originally greater;


3.24.2
1896
εἰσὶ γάρ τινες αὐτῶν οἳ ἀπετράποντο ἐς τὴν πόλιν πρὶν ὑπερβαίνειν , εἷς δ’ ἐπὶ τῇ ἔξω τάφρῳ τοξότης ἐλήφθη .
for some of them turned back again into the city before they passed over the wall, and one bowman was taken prisoner at the outer ditch.


3.24.3
1897
οἱ μὲν οὖν Πελοποννήσιοι κατὰ χώραν ἐγένοντο τῆς βοηθείας παυσάμενοι ·
So the Peloponnesians gave up the pursuit and returned to their posts;


3.24.3
1898
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Πλαταιῆς τῶν μὲν γεγενημένων εἰδότες οὐδέν , τῶν δὲ ἀποτραπομένων σφίσιν ἀπαγγειλάντων ὡς οὐδεὶς περίεστι , κήρυκα ἐκπέμψαντες , ἐπεὶ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο , ἐσπένδοντο ἀναίρεσιν τοῖς νεκροῖς , μαθόντες δὲ τὸ ἀληθὲς ἐπαύσαντο .
while the Plataeans in the town, knowing nothing of what had happened, but having been informed by those who returned that not a man had escaped, sent out a herald as soon as it was day, and wished to make a truce for taking up their dead; when, however, they knew the truth, they ceased from their application.


3.24.3
1899
οἱ μὲν δὴ τῶν Πλαταιῶν ἄνδρες οὕτως ὑπερβάντες ἐσώθησαν .
In this way then the party of Plataeans passed over the wall and were saved.


3.25.1
1900
ἐκ δὲ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος τελευτῶντος ἐκπέμπεται Σάλαιθος ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος ἐς Μυτιλήνην τριήρει .
At the close of the same winter, Salaethus the Lacedaemonian was sent out from Lacedaemon in a trireme to Mytilene;


3.25.1
1901
καὶ πλεύσας ἐς Πύρραν καὶ ἐξ αὐτῆς πεζῇ κατὰ χαράδραν τινά , ᾗ ὑπερβατὸν ἦν τὸ περιτείχισμα , διαλαθὼν ἐσέρχεται ἐς τὴν Μυτιλήνην , καὶ ἔλεγε τοῖς προέδροις ὅτι ἐσβολή τε ἅμα ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἔσται καὶ αἱ τεσσαράκοντα νῆες παρέσονται ἃς ἔδει βοηθῆσαι αὐτοῖς , προαποπεμφθῆναί τε αὐτὸς τούτων ἕνεκα καὶ ἅμα τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιμελησόμενος .
and having gone by sea to Pyrrha, and thence by land, he entered Mytilene unobserved, along the bed of a torrent, where the lines round the town were passable, and told the magistrates that there would be an invasion of Attica, and at the same time the ships would come which were to have assisted them before; and that he himself had been despatched in advance on this account, and to attend to all other matters.


3.25.2
1902
καὶ οἱ μὲν Μυτιληναῖοι ἐθάρσουν τε καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἧσσον εἶχον τὴν γνώμην ὥστε ξυμβαίνειν .
The Mytilenaeans therefore took fresh courage, and thought less of coming to terms with the Athenians.


3.25.2
1903
ὅ τε χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα οὗτος , καὶ τέταρτον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
And so ended this winter, and the fourth year of the war of which Thucydides wrote the history.


3.26.1
1904
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐπειδὴ τὰς ἐς τὴν Μυτιλήνην δύο καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς ἀπέστειλαν ἄρχοντα Ἀλκίδαν , ὃς ἦν αὐτοῖς ναύαρχος , προστάξαντες , αὐτοὶ ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐσέβαλον , ὅπως οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀμφοτέρωθεν θορυβούμενοι ἧσσον ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐς τὴν Μυτιλήνην καταπλεούσαις ἐπιβοηθήσωσιν .
The following summer, after the Peloponnesians had despatched Alcidas, who was their high-admiral, (for they had conferred that office upon him,) with the two and forty ships to Mytilene, they themselves and their allies made an irruption into Attica; that the Athenians, being harassed both ways, might be the less able to send succours against the slips that were sailing to Mytilene.


3.26.2
1905
ἡγεῖτο δὲ τῆς ἐσβολῆς ταύτης Κλεομένης ὑπὲρ Παυσανίου τοῦ Πλειστοάνακτος υἱέος βασιλέως ὄντος καὶ νεωτέρου ἔτι , πατρὸς δὲ ἀδελφὸς ὤν .
The commander in this irruption was Cleomenes, as representative of Pausanias, the son of Pleistoanax, who was king, and still a minor, and Cleomenes was his father's brother.


3.26.3
1906
ἐδῄωσαν δὲ τῆς Ἀττικῆς τά τε πρότερον τετμημένα καὶ εἴ τι ἐβεβλαστήκει καὶ ὅσα ἐν ταῖς πρὶν ἐσβολαῖς παρελέλειπτο ·
They ravaged therefore both the parts which had been devastated before, if there were anything that had shot up again,


3.26.3
1907
καὶ ἡ ἐσβολὴ αὕτη χαλεπωτάτη ἐγένετο τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις μετὰ τὴν δευτέραν .
and all that had been passed over in their previous irruptions. And this invasion was most severely felt by the Athenians, next to the second;


3.26.4
1908
ἐπιμένοντες γὰρ αἰεὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Λέσβου τι πεύσεσθαι τῶν νεῶν ἔργον ὡς ἤδη πεπεραιωμένων ἐπεξῆλθον τὰ πολλὰ τέμνοντες .
for continually expecting to hear from Lesbos of some achievement performed by their ships, which they thought had by this time made their passage, they went on committing general devastation.


3.26.4
1909
ὡς δ’ οὐδὲν ἀπέβαινεν αὐτοῖς ὧν προσεδέχοντο κὰ ἐπελελοίπει ὁ σῖτος , ἀνεχώρησαν καὶ διελύθησαν κατὰ πόλεις .
When, however, none of the results which they expected was obtained, and when their provisions had failed, they returned, and were dispersed through their several countries.


3.27.1
1910
οἱ δὲ Μυτιληναῖοι ἐν τούτῳ , ὡς αἵ τε νῆες αὐτοῖς οὐχ ἧκον ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἀλλὰ ἐνεχρόνιζον καὶ ὁ σῖτος ἐπελελοίπει , ἀναγκάζονται ξυμβαίνειν πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους διὰ τάδε .
The Mytilenaeans, meanwhile, as the ships from the Peloponnese had not come to them, but were wasting the time, and as their provisions had failed, were compelled to come to terms with the Athenians, by the following circumstances.


3.27.2
1911
ὁ Σάλαιθος καὶ αὐτὸς οὐ προσδεχόμενος ἔτι τὰς ναῦς ὁπλίζει τὸν δῆμον πρότερον ψιλὸν ὄντα ὡς ἐπεξιὼν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ·
Since even Salaethus himself no longer expected the arrival of the fleet, he equipped as heavy-armed soldiers the commons who had before been only light-armed, with a view to sallying out against the Athenians;


3.27.3
1912
οἱ δὲ ἐπειδὴ ἔλαβον ὅπλα , οὔτε ἠκροῶντο ἔτι τῶν ἀρχόντων , κατὰ ξυλλόγους τε γιγνόμενοι ἢ τὸν σῖτον ἐκέλευον τοὺς δυνατοὺς φέρειν ἐς τὸ φανερὸν καὶ διανέμειν ἅπασιν , ἢ αὐτοὶ ξυγχωρήσαντες πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ἔφασαν παραδώσειν τὴν πόλιν .
but as soon as they were in possession of arms, they no longer obeyed their commanders, but collecting in groups, ordered those in power to bring the provision-stores into public view, and divide them amongst all; or they would themselves make terms with the Athenians, and deliver up the city.


3.28.1
1913
γνόντες δὲ οἱ ἐν τοῖς πράγμασιν οὔτ’ ἀποκωλύειν δυνατοὶ ὄντες , εἴ τ’ ἀπομονωθήσονται τῆς ξυμβάσεως κινδυνεύσοντες , ποιοῦνται κοινῇ ὁμολογίαν πρός τε Πάχητα καὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον , ὥστε Ἀθηναίοις μὲν ἐξεῖναι βουλεῦσαι περὶ Μυτιληναίων ὁποῖον ἄν τι βούλωνται καὶ τὴν στρατιὰν ἐς τὴν πόλιν δέχεσθαι αὐτούς , πρεσβείαν δὲ ἀποστέλλειν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας Μυτιληναίους περὶ ἑαυτῶν ·
The members of the government, knowing that they would not be able to prevent them, and that they would themselves be exposed to danger if excluded from the arrangement, made a general agreement with Paches and the army, that the Athenians should be at liberty to adopt what measures they chose respecting the Mytilenaeans; that they should receive the army into the city, and send ambassadors to Athens to plead their cause;


3.28.1
1914
ἐν ὅσῳ δ’ ἂν πάλιν ἔλθωσι , Πάχητα μήτε δῆσαι Μυτιληναίων μηδένα μηδὲ ἀνδραποδίσαι μήτε ἀποκτεῖναι .
and that until they returned, Paches should neither throw into prison, nor reduce to slavery, nor put to death, any of the Mytilenaeans. This was the nature of the agreement:


3.28.2
1915
ἡ μὲν ξύμβασις αὕτη ἐγένετο , οἱ δὲ πράξαντες πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους μάλιστα τῶν Μυτιληναίων περιδεεῖς ὄντες , ὡς ἡ στρατιὰ ἐσῆλθεν , οὐκ ἠνέσχοντο , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τοὺς βωμοὺς ὅμως καθίζουσιν ·
but those of the inhabitants who had been most prominent in negotiating with the Lacedaemonians, were very much alarmed when the army entered the city, and could not restrain themselves, but went and seated themselves by the altars, notwithstanding [the assurances that had been given].


3.28.2
1916
Πάχης δ’ ἀναστήσας αὐτοὺς ὥστε μὴ ἀδικῆσαι , κατατίθεται ἐς Τένεδον μέχρι οὗ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τι δόξῃ .
Paches, however, raised them up with a promise to do them no harm, and deposited them in Tenedos until the Athenians should have come to some determination about them.


3.28.3
1917
πέμψας δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν Ἄντισσαν τριήρεις προσεκτήσατο καὶ τ- ἄλλα τὰ περὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον καθίστατο ᾗ αὐτῷ ἐδόκει .
He also sent some triremes to Antissa, and won the place over; and arranged all other matters concerning the forces as he pleased.


3.29.1
1918
οἱ δ’ ἐν ταῖς τεσσαράκοντα ναυσὶ Πελοποννήσιοι , οὓς ἔδει ἐν τάχει παραγενέσθαι , πλέοντες περί τε αὐτὴν τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἐνδιέτριψαν καὶ κατὰ τὸν ἄλλον πλοῦν σχολαῖοι κομισθέντες τοὺς μὲν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Ἀθηναίους λανθάνουσι , πρὶν δὴ τῇ Δήλῳ ἔσχον , προσμείξαντες δ’ ἀπ’ αὐτῆς τῇ Ἰκάρῳ καὶ Μυκόνῳ πυνθάνονται πρῶτον ὅτι ἡ Μυτιλήνη ἑάλωκεν .
Now the Peloponnesians on board the forty ships, who ought with all speed to have joined the Mytilenaeans, both lost time in cruising about the Peloponnese itself, and proceeded at their leisure during the rest of the voyage, unobserved by the Athenians at home, until they touched at Delos; after leaving which island they came to land at Icarus and Myconus, and there received the first tidings of the capture of Mytilene.


3.29.2
1919
βουλόμενοι δὲ τὸ σαφὲς εἰδέναι κατέπλευσαν ἐς Ἔμβατον τῆς Ἐρυθραίας ·
Wishing, however, to know the exact truth of the matter, they put into Embatum in the Erythraean territory


3.29.2
1920
ἡμέραι δὲ μάλιστα ἦσαν τῇ Μυτιλήνῃ ἑαλωκυίᾳ ἑπτὰ ὅτε ἐς τὸ Ἔμβατον κατέπλευσαν .
seven days having elapsed from the taking of Mytilene when they did so.


3.29.2
1921
πυθόμενοι δὲ τὸ σαφὲς ἐβουλεύοντο ἐκ τῶν παρόντων , καὶ ἔλεξεν αὐτοῖς Τευτίαπλος ἀνὴρ Ἠλεῖος τάδε .
After hearing the exact truth, they consulted on the present state of affairs; and Teutiaplus, an Elean, addressed them as follows:


3.30.1
1922
&quot; Ἀλκίδα καὶ Πελοποννησίων ὅσοι πάρεσμεν ἄρχοντες τῆς στρατιᾶς , ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ πλεῖν ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ Μυτιλήνην πρὶν ἐκπύστους γενέσθαι , ὥσπερ ἔχομεν .
" Alcidas, and the rest of my Peloponnesian colleagues in the command of the forces, my opinion is that we should sail straightway to Mytilene, before we have been heard of."


3.30.2
1923
κατὰ γὰρ τὸ εἰκὸς ἀνδρῶν νεωστὶ πόλιν ἐχόντων πολὺ τὸ ἀφύλακτον εὑρήσομεν , κατὰ μὲν θάλασσαν καὶ πάνυ , ᾗ ἐκεῖνοί τε ἀνέλπιστοι ἐπιγενέσθαι ἄν τινα σφίσι πολέμιον καὶ ἡμῶν ἡ ἀλκὴ τυγχάνει μάλιστα οὖσα ·
For in all probability we shall find great want of watchfulness, as is usual on the part of men who have but recently taken possession of a city.


3.30.2
1924
εἰκὸς δὲ καὶ τὸ πεζὸν αὐτῶν κατ’ οἰκίας ἀμελέστερον ὡς κεκρατηκότων διεσπάρθαι .
By sea, indeed, where they have no thought of any enemy attacking them, and where our strength mainly lies, this will be altogether the case; and even their land-forces are likely to be dispersed through the houses too carelessly.


3.30.3
1925
εἰ οὖν προσπέσοιμεν ἄφνω τε καὶ νυκτός , ἐλπίζω μετὰ τῶν ἔνδον , εἴ τις ἄρα ἡμῖν ἐστὶν ὑπόλοιπος εὔνους , καταληφθῆναι ἂν τὰ πράγματα .
" If then we were to fall upon them suddenly and in the night, I hope that with the aid of those in the city, (if, indeed, there be any one left who wishes us well,) possession of the place might be gained."


3.30.4
1926
καὶ μὴ ἀποκνήσωμεν τὸν κίνδυνον , νομίσαντες οὐκ ἄλλο τι εἶναι τὸ κενὸν τοῦ πολέμου ἢ τὸ τοιοῦτον , ὃ εἴ τις στρατηγὸς ἔν τε αὑτῷ φυλάσσοιτο καὶ τοῖς πολεμίοις ἐνορῶν ἐπιχειροίη , πλεῖστ’ ἂν ὀρθοῖτο &quot; .
" And let us not shrink from the danger, but consider that the proverbial " surprises of war"  are nothing else than chances such as this; which if any one should guard against in his own case, and avail himself of them, when he saw them in the case of his enemy, he would be a most successful general."


3.31.1
1927
ὁ μὲν τοσαῦτα εἰπὼν οὐκ ἔπειθε τὸν Ἀλκίδαν .
Such was his speech; but he did not persuade Alcidas.


3.31.1
1928
ἄλλοι δέ τινες τῶν ἀπ’ Ἰωνίας φυγάδων καὶ οἱ Λέσβιοι οἱ ξυμπλέοντες παρῄνουν , ἐπειδὴ τοῦτον τὸν κίνδυνον φοβεῖται , τῶν ἐν Ἰωνίᾳ πόλεων καταλαβεῖν τινὰ ἢ Κύμην τὴν Αἰολίδα , ὅπως ἐκ πόλεως ὁρμώμενοι τὴν Ἰωνίαν ἀποστήσωσιν ( ἐλπίδα δ’ εἶναι ·
On the other hand, some of the exiles from Ionia and the Lesbians who were on board with them, advised, that since he was afraid of that danger, he should seize one of the Ionian cities, or Cyme in Aeolia; so that having a city as the base of their operations they might excite Ionia to revolt: (and there was reason to hope this,


3.31.1
1929
οὐδενὶ γὰρ ἀκουσίως ἀφῖχθαι ) καὶ τὴν πρόσοδον ταύτην μεγίστην οὖσαν Ἀθηναίων ἢν ὑφέλωσι , καὶ ἅμα , ἢν ἐφορμῶσι σφίσιν , αὐτοῖς δαπάνη γίγνηται ·
If then they should take away from the Athenians this their chief source of revenue, and if at the same time they should themselves incur the expense of keeping a fleet of observation,


3.31.1
1930
πείσειν τε οἴεσθαι καὶ Πισσούθνην ὥστε ξυμπολεμεῖν .
they thought they should prevail on Pisuthnes also to take part in the war with them.


3.31.2
1931
ὁ δὲ οὐδὲ ταῦτα ἐνεδέχετο , ἀλλὰ τὸ πλεῖστον τῆς γνώμης εἶχεν , ἐπειδὴ τῆς Μυτιλήνης ὑστερήκει , ὅτι τάχιστα τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ πάλιν προσμεῖξαι .
He did not, however, accede to this proposal either; but was most strongly inclined, since he had come too late for Mytilene, to reach the Peloponnese again as quickly as possible.


3.32.1
1932
ἄρας δὲ ἐκ τοῦ Ἐμβάτου παρέπλει , καὶ προσσχὼν Μυοννήσῳ τῇ Τηίων τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους οὓς κατὰ πλοῦν εἰλήφει ἀπέσφαξε τοὺς πολλούς .
Weighing therefore from Embatum, he coasted along, and having touched at Myonnesus, a place belonging to the Teians, he butchered most of the prisoners he had taken on his passage.


3.32.2
1933
καὶ ἐς τὴν Ἔφεσον καθορμισαμένου αὐτοῦ Σαμίων τῶν ἐξ Ἀναίων ἀφικόμενοι πρέσβεις ἔλεγον οὐ καλῶς τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἐλευθεροῦν αὐτόν , εἰ ἄνδρας διέφθειρεν οὔτε χεῖρας ἀνταιρομένους οὔτε πολεμίους , Ἀθηναίων δὲ ὑπὸ ἀνάγκης ξυμμάχους ·
On his coming to anchor at Ephesus ambassadors came from the Samians of Anaea, and told him that he was not liberating Greece in the right way, by destroying men who were neither raising their hands against him, nor were hostile to him, but allies of the Athenians through necessity;


3.32.2
1934
εἴ τε μὴ παύσεται , ὀλίγους μὲν αὐτὸν τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐς φιλίαν προσάξεσθαι , πολὺ δὲ πλείους τῶν φίλων πολεμίους ἕξειν .
and if he did not cease, he would bring few of his enemies into friendship with him, but would find many more of his friends become his enemies.


3.32.3
1935
καὶ ὁ μὲν ἐπείσθη τε καὶ Χίων ἄνδρας ὅσους εἶχεν ἔτι ἀφῆκε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τινάς ·
He was convinced [by these arguments], and set at liberty all the Chians he had still in his hands, and some of the others.


3.32.3
1936
ὁρῶντες γὰρ τὰς ναῦς οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὐκ ἔφευγον , ἀλλὰ προσεχώρουν μᾶλλον ὡς Ἀττικαῖς καὶ ἐλπίδα οὐδὲ τὴν ἐλαχίστην εἶχον μή ποτε Ἀθηναίων τῆς θαλάσσης κρατούντων ναῦς Πελοποννησίων ἐς Ἰωνίαν παραβαλεῖν .
[And there had been very many taken by him]; for at the sight of his ships the men did not fly, but rather came to them, thinking they were from Athens; and they had not even the slightest expectation, that while the Athenians had command of the sea, Peloponnesian ships would dare to cross over to Ionia.


3.33.1
1937
ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς Ἐφέσου ὁ Ἀλκίδας ἔπλει κατὰ τάχος καὶ φυγὴν ἐποιεῖτο ·
From Ephesus Alcidas sailed as quickly as possible, and took to flight.


3.33.1
1938
ὤφθη γὰρ ὑπὸ τῆς Σαλαμινίας καὶ Παράλου ἔτι περὶ Κλάρον ὁρμῶν ( αἱ δ’ ἀπ’ Ἀθηνῶν ἔτυχον πλέουσαι ) , καὶ δεδιὼς τὴν δίωξιν ἔπλει διὰ τοῦ πελάγους ὡς γῇ ἑκούσιος οὐ σχήσων ἄλλῃ ἢ Πελοποννήσῳ .
For while still lying at anchor off Clarus, he had been seen by the Salaminian and the Paralus ships, (which happened to be sailing from Athens,) and fearing pursuit, he took his course across the open sea, intending to make no land voluntarily but the Peloponnese.


3.33.2
1939
τῷ δὲ Πάχητι καὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἦλθε μὲν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἐρυθραίας ἀγγελία , ἀφικνεῖτο δὲ καὶ πανταχόθεν ·
Now tidings of him had been sent to Paches and the Athenians from the Erythraean country, and indeed from every quarter;


3.33.2
1940
ἀτειχίστου γὰρ οὔσης τῆς Ἰωνίας μέγα τὸ δέος ἐγένετο μὴ παραπλέοντες οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι , εἰ καὶ ὣς μὴ διενοοῦντο μένειν , πορθῶσιν ἅμα προσπίπτοντες τὰς πόλεις .
for as Ionia had no fortified towns, the alarm was great lest the Peloponnesians in coasting along, even though they did not intend to stay, might at the same time assault and plunder the cities.


3.33.2
1941
αὐτάγγελοι δ’ αὐτὸν ἰδοῦσαι ἐν τῇ Κλάρῳ ἥ τε Πάραλος καὶ ἡ Σαλαμινία ἔφρασαν .
And now the Paralus and Salaminian, having seen him at Clarus, themselves brought intelligence of the fact.


3.33.3
1942
ὁ δὲ ὑπὸ σπουδῆς ἐποιεῖτο τὴν δίωξιν ·
Accordingly he made chase with all speed.


3.33.3
1943
καὶ μέχρι μὲν Πάτμου τῆς νήσου ἐπεδίωξεν , ὡς δ’ οὐκέτι ἐν καταλήψει ἐφαίνετο , ἐπανεχώρει .
He continued in pursuit of him as far as the isle of Patmos, but returned when he found that he was not within distance to be overtaken.


3.33.3
1944
κέρδος δὲ ἐνόμισεν , ἐπειδὴ οὐ μετεώροις περιέτυχεν , ὅτι οὐδαμοῦ ἐγκαταληφθεῖσαι ἠναγκάσθησαν στρατόπεδόν τε ποιεῖσθαι καὶ φυλακὴν σφίσι καὶ ἐφόρμησιν παρασχεῖν .
He considered it, however, a lucky thing, as he did not fall in with them out at sea, that they had not been overtaken anywhere near shore, and obliged to form an encampment, and so give his forces the trouble of watching and blockading them.


3.34.1
1945
παραπλέων δὲ πάλιν ἔσχε καὶ ἐς Νότιον τὸ Κολοφωνίων , οὗ κατῴκηντο Κολοφώνιοι τῆς ἄνω πόλεως ἑαλωκυίας ὑπὸ Ἰταμάνους καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων κατὰ στάσιν ἰδίαν ἐπαχθέντων ·
As he coasted along on his return, he touched, amongst other places, at Notium, [the port] of the Colophonians, where they had settled after the capture of the upper city by Itamenes and the barbarians, who had been called in by individuals on the ground of a factious quarrel.


3.34.1
1946
ἑάλω δὲ μάλιστα αὕτη ὅτε ἡ δευτέρα Πελοποννησίων ἐσβολὴ ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐγίγνετο .
The city was taken about the time that the second irruption of the Peloponnesians into Attica took place.


3.34.2
1947
ἐν οὖν τῷ Νοτίῳ οἱ καταφυγόντες καὶ κατοικήσαντες αὐτόθι αὖθις στασιάσαντες , οἱ μὲν παρὰ Πισσούθνου ἐπικούρους Ἀρκάδων τε καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων ἐπαγαγόμενοι ἐν διατειχίσματι εἶχον , καὶ τῶν ἐκ τῆς ἄνω πόλεως Κολοφωνίων οἱ μηδίσαντες ξυνεσελθόντες ἐπολίτευον , οἱ δὲ ὑπεξελθόντες τούτους καὶ ὄντες φυγάδες τὸν Πάχητα ἐπάγονται .
Those then who had fled for refuge to Notium, and settled there, having again split into factions, one party introduced and kept in the fortified quarter of the town an auxiliary force of Arcadians and barbarians sent by Pisuthnes; and those of the Colophonians in the upper city who formed the Median party, went in with them and joined their community;


3.34.3
1948
ὁ δὲ προκαλεσάμενος ἐς λόγους Ἱππίαν τῶν ἐν τῷ διατειχίσματι Ἀρκάδων ἄρχοντα , ὥστε , ἢν μηδὲν ἀρέσκον λέγῃ , πάλιν αὐτὸν καταστήσειν ἐς τὸ τεῖχος σῶν καὶ ὑγιᾶ , ὁ μὲν ἐξῆλθε παρ’ αὐτόν , ὁ δ’ ἐκεῖνον μὲν ἐν φυλακῇ ἀδέσμῳ εἶχεν , αὐτὸς δὲ προσβαλὼν τῷ τειχίσματι ἐξαπιναίως καὶ οὐ προσδεχομένων αἱρεῖ , τούς τε Ἀρκάδας καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων ὅσοι ἐνῆσαν διαφθείρει ·
He invited Hippias, the commander of the Arcadians in the fortified quarter, to a parley, on condition that if he proposed nothing to meet his wishes, he should restore him safe and sound to the fortress; but when he went out to him, he kept him in hold, though not in bonds; and having assaulted the place on a sudden and when they were not expecting it, he took it, and put to the sword the Arcadians and all the rest that were in it.


3.34.3
1949
καὶ τὸν Ἱππίαν ὕστερον ἐσαγαγὼν ὥσπερ ἐσπείσατο , ἐπειδὴ ἔνδον ἦν , ξυλλαμβάνει καὶ κατατοξεύει .
Having afterwards taken Hippias into it, as he had agreed to do, he seized him when he was inside, and shot him through.


3.34.4
1950
Κολοφωνίοις δὲ Νότιον παραδίδωσι πλὴν τῶν μηδισάντων .
He then gave up Notium to the Colophonians, excepting the Median party;


3.34.4
1951
καὶ ὕστερον Ἀθηναῖοι οἰκιστὰς πέμψαντες κατὰ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νόμους κατῴκισαν τὸ Νότιον , ξυναγαγόντες πάντας ἐκ τῶν πόλεων , εἴ πού τις ἦν Κολοφωνίων .
and the Athenians subsequently sent out colonists, and settled the place according to their own laws; having collected all the Colophonians, wherever there was one in any of the cities.


3.35.1
1952
ὁ δὲ Πάχης ἀφικόμενος ἐς τὴν Μυτιλήνην τήν τε Πύρραν καὶ Ἔρεσον παρεστήσατο , καὶ Σάλαιθον λαβὼν ἐν τῇ πόλει τὸν Λακεδαιμόνιον κεκρυμμένον ἀποπέμπει ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Τενέδου Μυτιληναίων ἄνδρας ἅμα οὓς κατέθετο καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος αὐτῷ αἴτιος ἐδόκει εἶναι τῆς ἀποστάσεως ·
On his arrival at Mytilene Paches reduced Pyrrha an Eresus, and having seized Salaethus the Lacedaemonian in the city, where he was hiding, he despatched him to Athens, and with him the Mytilenaeans at Tenedos, whom he had deposited there, and whomever else he thought implicated in the revolt. He also sent back the greater part of his forces.


3.35.2
1953
ἀποπέμπει δὲ καὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς τὸ πλέον , τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς ὑπομένων καθίστατο τὰ περὶ τὴν Μυτιλήνην καὶ τὴν ἄλλην Λέσβον ᾗ αὐτῷ ἐδόκει .
With the remainder he stayed there, and settled the affairs of Mytilene and the rest of Lesbos, as he thought proper.


3.36.1
1954
ἀφικομένων δὲ τῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ τοῦ Σαλαίθου οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸν μὲν Σάλαιθον εὐθὺς ἀπέκτειναν , ἔστιν ἃ παρεχόμενον τά τ’ ἄλλα καὶ ἀπὸ Πλαταιῶν ( ἔτι γὰρ ἐπολιορκοῦντο ) ἀπάξειν Πελοποννησίους ·
On the arrival of the men with Salaethus, the Athenians immediately put the latter to death, though he held out certain promises, and amongst others, that he would obtain the retreat of the Peloponnesians from Plataea (for it was still being besieged):


3.36.2
1955
περὶ δὲ τῶν ἀνδρῶν γνώμας ἐποιοῦντο , καὶ ὑπὸ ὀργῆς ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς οὐ τοὺς παρόντας μόνον ἀποκτεῖναι , ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἅπαντας Μυτιληναίους ὅσοι ἡβῶσι , παῖδας δὲ καὶ γυναῖκας ἀνδραποδίσαι , ἐπικαλοῦντες τήν τε ἄλλην ἀπόστασιν ὅτι οὐκ ἀρχόμενοι ὥσπερ οἱ ἄλλοι ἐποιήσαντο , καὶ προσξυνελάβοντο οὐκ ἐλάχιστον τῆς ὁρμῆς αἱ Πελοποννησίων νῆες ἐς Ἰωνίαν ἐκείνοις βοηθοὶ τολμήσασαι παρακινδυνεῦσαι ·
but respecting the former they deliberated what to do; and in their anger they determined to put to death, not only those that were there, but all the Mytilenaeans also that were of age; and to make slaves of the women and children.


3.36.2
1956
οὐ γὰρ ἀπὸ βραχείας διανοίας ἐδόκουν τὴν ἀπόστασιν ποιήσασθαι .
For they both urged against them [the aggravated character of] their revolt in other respects, namely, that they had executed it without being subject to their dominion, like the rest; and the fact of the Peloponnesian ships having dared to venture over to Ionia to assist them, contributed also no little to their wrath.


3.36.3
1957
πέμπουσιν οὖν τριήρη ὡς Πάχητα ἄγγελον τῶν δεδογμένων , κατὰ τάχος κελεύοντες διαχρήσασθαι Μυτιληναίους .
for they thought it was with no short premeditation that they had revolted. They sent therefore a trireme to Paches with intelligence of their resolution, and commanded him to despatch the Mytilenaeans as quickly as possible.


3.36.4
1958
καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ μετάνοιά τις εὐθὺς ἦν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀναλογισμὸς ὠμὸν τὸ βούλευμα καὶ μέγα ἐγνῶσθαι , πόλιν ὅλην διαφθεῖραι μᾶλλον ἢ οὐ τοὺς αἰτίους .
The next day they felt immediately a degree of repentance, and reflected that the resolution they had passed was a cruel and sweeping one, to put a whole city to the sword, instead of those who were guilty.


3.36.5
1959
ὡς δ’ ᾔσθοντο τοῦτο τῶν Μυτιληναίων οἱ παρόντες πρέσβεις καὶ οἱ αὐτοῖς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ξυμπράσσοντες , παρεσκεύασαν τοὺς ἐν τέλει ὥστε αὖθις γνώμας προθεῖναι ·
When the Mytilenaean ambassadors who were present, and those of the Athenians who co-operated with them, perceived this, they got the authorities to put the question again to the vote;


3.36.5
1960
καὶ ἔπεισαν ῥᾷον , διότι καὶ ἐκείνοις ἔνδηλον ἦν βουλόμενον τὸ πλέον τῶν πολιτῶν αὖθίς τινας σφίσιν ἀποδοῦναι βουλεύσασθαι .
and the more easily prevailed on them to do it, because they also saw plainly that the majority of the citizens wished some one to give them another opportunity of deliberating.


3.36.6
1961
καταστάσης δ’ εὐθὺς ἐκκλησίας ἄλλαι τε γνῶμαι ἀφ’ ἑκάστων ἐλέγοντο καὶ Κλέων ὁ Κλεαινέτου , ὅσπερ καὶ τὴν προτέραν ἐνενικήκει ὥστε ἀποκτεῖναι , ὢν καὶ ἐς τὰ ἄλλα βιαιότατος τῶν πολιτῶν τῷ τε δήμῳ παρὰ πολὺ ἐν τῷ τότε πιθανώτατος , παρελθὼν αὖθις ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
An assembly therefore being immediately summoned, different opinions were expressed on both sides; and Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, who had carried the former resolution, to put them to death, being on other subjects also the most violent of the citizens, and by far the most influential with the commons, at that time came forward again, and spoke as follows:


3.37.1
1962
&quot; πολλάκις μὲν ἤδη ἔγωγε καὶ ἄλλοτε ἔγνων δημοκρατίαν ὅτι ἀδύνατόν ἐστιν ἑτέρων ἄρχειν , μάλιστα δ’ ἐν τῇ νῦν ὑμετέρᾳ περὶ Μυτιληναίων μεταμελείᾳ .
"On many other occasions before this have I been convinced that a democracy is incapable of maintaining dominion over others, and I am so more than ever from your present change of purpose respecting the Mytilenaeans.


3.37.2
1963
διὰ γὰρ τὸ καθ’ ἡμέραν ἀδεὲς καὶ ἀνεπιβούλευτον πρὸς ἀλλήλους καὶ ἐς τοὺς ξυμμάχους τὸ αὐτὸ ἔχετε , καὶ ὅτι ἂν ἢ λόγῳ πεισθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἁμάρτητε ἢ οἴκτῳ ἐνδῶτε , οὐκ ἐπικινδύνως ἡγεῖσθε ἐς ὑμᾶς καὶ οὐκ ἐς τὴν τῶν ξυμμάχων χάριν μαλακίζεσθαι , οὐ σκοποῦντες ὅτι τυραννίδα ἔχετε τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ πρὸς ἐπιβουλεύοντας αὐτοὺς καὶ ἄκοντας ἀρχομένους , οἳ οὐκ ἐξ ὧν ἂν χαρίζησθε βλαπτόμενοι αὐτοὶ ἀκροῶνται ὑμῶν , ἀλλ’ ἐξ ὧν ἂν ἰσχύι μᾶλλον ἢ τῇ ἐκείνων εὐνοίᾳ περιγένησθε .
For owing to your daily freedom from fear, and from plotting against each other, you entertain the same views towards your allies also. And you do not reflect, in whatever case you may either have made a mistake through being persuaded by their words, or may have given way to pity, that you show such weakness to your own peril, and at the same time too gain no gratitude from your allies; not considering that it is a tyrannical dominion which you hold, and over men who are plotting against you, and involuntarily subject to you;


3.37.3
1964
πάντων δὲ δεινότατον εἰ βέβαιον ἡμῖν μηδὲν καθεστήξει ὧν ἂν δόξῃ πέρι , μηδὲ γνωσόμεθα ὅτι χείροσι νόμοις ἀκινήτοις χρωμένη πόλις κρείσσων ἐστὶν ἢ καλῶς ἔχουσιν ἀκύροις , ἀμαθία τε μετὰ σωφροσύνης ὠφελιμώτερον ἢ δεξιότης μετὰ ἀκολασίας , οἵ τε φαυλότεροι τῶν ἀνθρώπων πρὸς τοὺς ξυνετωτέρους ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πλέον ἄμεινον οἰκοῦσι τὰς πόλεις .
and who obey you not from any favours you confer on them to your own hurt, but from the fact of your being superior to them through your power, rather than their good feeling. But of all things is the most fearful if nothing of what we have resolved stedfast; and if we are not convince that a state with inferior laws which are unchanged is better than one with good ones which are not authoritative; the homely wit with moderation is more useful than cleverness with intemperance;


3.37.4
1965
οἱ μὲν γὰρ τῶν τε νόμων σοφώτεροι βούλονται φαίνεσθαι τῶν τε αἰεὶ λεγομένων ἐς τὸ κοινὸν περιγίγνεσθαι , ὡς ἐν ἄλλοις μείζοσιν οὐκ ἂν δηλώσαντες τὴν γνώμην , καὶ ἐκ τοῦ τοιούτου τὰ πολλὰ σφάλλουσι τὰς πόλεις ·
and the duller class of men, compared with the more talented, generally speaking, manage public affairs better.


3.37.4
1966
οἱ δ’ ἀπιστοῦντες τῇ ἐξ αὑτῶν ξυνέσει ἀμαθέστεροι μὲν τῶν νόμων ἀξιοῦσιν εἶναι , ἀδυνατώτεροι δὲ τοῦ καλῶς εἰπόντος μέμψασθαι λόγον , κριταὶ δὲ ὄντες ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου μᾶλλον ἢ ἀγωνισταὶ ὀρθοῦνται τὰ πλείω .
For the latter wish to appear wiser than the laws, and to overrule what is ever spoken for the public good—think in that they could not show their wisdom in more important matters—and by such means they generally ruin their country. But the former, distrusting their own talent deign to be less learned than the laws and less able than to find fault with the words of one who has spoken well; and being judges on fair terms, rather than rivals or a prize they are more commonly right in views.


3.37.5
1967
ὣς οὖν χρὴ καὶ ἡμᾶς ποιοῦντας μὴ δεινότητι καὶ ξυνέσεως ἀγῶνι ἐπαιρομένους παρὰ δόξαν τῷ ὑμετέρῳ πλήθει παραινεῖν .
So then rivals to do, and not to advise your people contrary to our real opinion, urged on by cleverness and rivalry of talent.


3.38.1
1968
&quot; ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν ὁ αὐτός εἰμι τῇ γνώμῃ καὶ θαυμάζω μὲν τῶν προθέντων αὖθις περὶ Μυτιληναίων λέγειν καὶ χρόνου διατριβὴν ἐμποιησάντων , ὅ ἐστι πρὸς τῶν ἠδικηκότων μᾶλλον ( ὁ γὰρ παθὼν τῷ δράσαντι ἀμβλυτέρᾳ τῇ ὀργῇ ἐπεξέρχεται , ἀμύνεσθαι δὲ τῷ παθεῖν ὅτι ἐγγυτάτω κείμενον ἀντίπαλον ὂν μάλιστα τὴν τιμωρίαν ἀναλαμβάνει ) , θαυμάζω δὲ καὶ ὅστις ἔσται ὁ ἀντερῶν καὶ ἀξιώσων ἀποφαίνειν τὰς μὲν Μυτιληναίων ἀδικίας ἡμῖν ὠφελίμους οὔσας , τὰς δ’ ἡμετέρας ξυμφορὰς τοῖς ξυμμάχοις βλάβας καθισταμένας .
"I, then, continue of the same opinion; and am astonished at those who have proposed to discuss a second time the case of the Mytilenaeans, and caused in it a delay of time, which is all for the advantage of the guilty (for so the sufferer proceeds against the offender with his anger less keen; whereas when retribution treads most closely on the heels of suffering, it best matches it in wreaking vengeance). I wonder, too, who will be the man to maintain the opposite opinion, and to pretend to show that the injuries done by the Mytilenaeans are beneficial to us, and that our misfortunes are losses to our allies. It is evident that either trusting to his eloquence he would strive to prove, in opposition to us, that what we consider most certain has not been ascertained;


3.38.2
1969
καὶ δῆλον ὅτι ἢ τῷ λέγειν πιστεύσας τὸ πάνυ δοκοῦν ἀνταποφῆναι ὡς οὐκ ἔγνωσται ἀγωνίσαιτ’ ἄν , ἢ κέρδει ἐπαιρόμενος τὸ εὐπρεπὲς τοῦ λόγου ἐκπονήσας παράγειν πειράσεται .
or, urged on by the hope of gain, will endeavour to lead us away by an elaborate display of specious language. But in such contests as these the state gives the prizes to others, and takes only the dangers itself.


3.38.3
1970
ἡ δὲ πόλις ἐκ τῶν τοιῶνδε ἀγώνων τὰ μὲν ἆθλα ἑτέροις δίδωσιν , αὐτὴ δὲ τοὺς κινδύνους ἀναφέρει .
And it is you who are to blame for it, through unwisely instituting these contests;


3.38.4
1971
αἴτιοι δ’ ὑμεῖς κακῶς ἀγωνοθετοῦντες , οἵτινες εἰώθατε θεαταὶ μὲν τῶν λόγων γίγνεσθαι , ἀκροαταὶ δὲ τῶν ἔργων , τὰ μὲν μέλλοντα ἔργα ἀπὸ τῶν εὖ εἰπόντων σκοποῦντες ὡς δυνατὰ γίγνεσθαι , τὰ δὲ πεπραγμένα ἤδη , οὐ τὸ δρασθὲν πιστότερον ὄψει λαβόντες ἢ τὸ ἀκουσθέν , ἀπὸ τῶν λόγῳ καλῶς ἐπιτιμησάντων ·
inasmuch as you are accustomed to attend to speeches like spectators [in a theatre], and to facts like mere listeners [to what others tell you]; with regard to things future, judging of their possibility from those who have spoken cleverly about them; and with regard to things which have already occurred, not taking what has been done as more credible from your having seen it, than what has been only heard from those who in words have delivered a clever invective.


3.38.5
1972
καὶ μετὰ καινότητος μὲν λόγου ἀπατᾶσθαι ἄριστοι , μετὰ δεδοκιμασμένου δὲ μὴ ξυνέπεσθαι ἐθέλειν , δοῦλοι ὄντες τῶν αἰεὶ ἀτόπων , ὑπερόπται δὲ τῶν εἰωθότων , καὶ μάλιστα μὲν αὐτὸς εἰπεῖν ἕκαστος βουλόμενος δύνασθαι , εἰ δὲ μή , ἀνταγωνιζόμενοι τοῖς τοιαῦτα λέγουσι μὴ ὕστεροι ἀκολουθῆσαι δοκεῖν τῇ γνώμῃ , ὀξέως δέ τι λέγοντος προεπαινέσαι , καὶ προαισθέσθαι τε πρόθυμοι εἶναι τὰ λεγόμενα καὶ προνοῆσαι βραδεῖς τὰ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀποβησόμενα , ζητοῦντές τε ἄλλο τι ὡς εἰπεῖν ἢ ἐν οἷς ζῶμεν , φρονοῦντες δὲ οὐδὲ περὶ τῶν παρόντων ἱκανῶς ·
And so you are the best men to be imposed on with novelty of argument, and to be unwilling to follow up what has been approved by you; being slaves to every new paradox, and despisers of what is ordinary. Each of you wishes, above all, to be able to speak himself;


3.38.7
1973
ἁπλῶς τε ἀκοῆς ἡδονῇ ἡσσώμενοι καὶ σοφιστῶν θεαταῖς ἐοικότες καθημένοις μᾶλλον ἢ περὶ πόλεως βουλευομένοις .
Thus you look, so to speak, for something different from the circumstances in which we are actually living; while you have not a sufficient understanding of even that which is before you. In a word, you are overpowered by the pleasures of the ear, and are like men sitting to be amused by rhetoricians rather than deliberating upon state affairs.


3.39.1
1974
&quot; ὧν ἐγὼ πειρώμενος ἀποτρέπειν ὑμᾶς ἀποφαίνω Μυτιληναίους μάλιστα δὴ μίαν πόλιν ἠδικηκότας ὑμᾶς .
"Wishing then to call you off from this course, I declare to you that the Mytilenaeans have injured you more than any one state ever did.


3.39.2
1975
ἐγὼ γάρ , οἵτινες μὲν μὴ δυνατοὶ φέρειν τὴν ὑμετέραν ἀρχὴν ἢ οἵτινες ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων ἀναγκασθέντες ἀπέστησαν , ξυγγνώμην ἔχω ·
For I can make allowance for men who have revolted because they could not endure your government, or because they were compelled by their enemies.


3.39.2
1976
νῆσον δὲ οἵτινες ἔχοντες μετὰ τειχῶν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν μόνον φοβούμενοι τοὺς ἡμετέρους πολεμίους , ἐν ᾧ καὶ αὐτοὶ τριήρων παρασκευῇ οὐκ ἄφαρκτοι ἦσαν πρὸς αὐτούς , αὐτόνομοί τε οἰκοῦντες καὶ τιμώμενοι ἐς τὰ πρῶτα ὑπὸ ἡμῶν τοιαῦτα εἰργάσαντο , τί ἄλλο οὗτοι ἢ ἐπεβούλευσάν τε καὶ ἐπανέστησαν μᾶλλον ἢ ἀπέστησαν ( ἀπόστασις μέν γε τῶν βίαιόν τι πασχόντων ἐστίν ) , ἐζήτησάν τε μετὰ τῶν πολεμιωτάτων ἡμᾶς στάντες διαφθεῖραι ;
But for those who inhabited an island with fortifications, and had only to fear our enemies by sea, on which element, too, they were themselves not unprotected against them by a fleet of triremes, and who lived independent, and were honoured in the highest degree by us, and then treated us in this way; what else did those men do than deliberately devise our ruin, and rise up against us, rather than revolt from us, (revolt, at least, is the part of those who are subject to some violent treatment,) and seek to ruin us by siding with our bitterest enemies?


3.39.2
1977
καίτοι δεινότερόν ἐστιν ἢ εἰ καθ’ αὑτοὺς δύναμιν κτώμενοι ἀντεπολέμησαν .
Yet surely that is more intolerable than if they waged war against you by themselves for the acquisition of power.


3.39.3
1978
παράδειγμα δὲ αὐτοῖς οὔτε αἱ τῶν πέλας ξυμφοραὶ ἐγένοντο , ὅσοι ἀποστάντες ἤδη ἡμῶν ἐχειρώθησαν , οὔτε ἡ παροῦσα εὐδαιμονία παρέσχεν ὄκνον μὴ ἐλθεῖν ἐς τὰ δεινά ·
Again, neither were the calamities of their neighbours, who had already revolted from us and been subdued, a warning to them;


3.39.3
1979
γενόμενοι δὲ πρὸς τὸ μέλλον θρασεῖς καὶ ἐλπίσαντες μακρότερα μὲν τῆς δυνάμεως , ἐλάσσω δὲ τῆς βουλήσεως , πόλεμον ἤραντο , ἰσχὺν ἀξιώσαντες τοῦ δικαίου προθεῖναι ·
nor did the good fortune they enjoyed make them loath to come into trouble; but being over-confident with regard to the future, and having formed hopes beyond their power, though less than their desire, they declared war, having determined to prefer might to right;


3.39.3
1980
ἐν ᾧ γὰρ ᾠήθησαν περιέσεσθαι , ἐπέθεντο ἡμῖν οὐκ ἀδικούμενοι .
for at a time when they thought they should overcome us, they attacked us, though they were not being wronged.


3.39.4
1981
εἴωθε δὲ τῶν πόλεων αἷς ἂν μάλιστα καὶ δι’ ἐλαχίστου ἀπροσδόκητος εὐπραγία ἔλθῃ , ἐς ὕβριν τρέπειν ·
But success is wont to make those states insolent to which it comes most unexpected and with the shortest notice;


3.39.4
1982
τὰ δὲ πολλὰ κατὰ λόγον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις εὐτυχοῦντα ἀσφαλέστερα ἢ παρὰ δόξαν , καὶ κακοπραγίαν ὡς εἰπεῖν ῥᾷον ἀπωθοῦνται ἢ εὐδαιμονίαν διασῴζονται .
whereas the good fortune which is according to men's calculation is generally more steady than when it comes beyond their expectation so to say, they more easily drive off adversity than they preserve prosperity.


3.39.5
1983
χρῆν δὲ Μυτιληναίους καὶ πάλαι μηδὲν διαφερόντως τῶν ἄλλων ὑφ’ ἡμῶν τετιμῆσθαι , καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐς τόδε ἐξύβρισαν ·
The Mytilenaeans, then, ought all along to have been honoured by us on the same footing as the rest, and in that case they would not have come to such a pitch of insolence;


3.39.5
1984
πέφυκε γὰρ καὶ ἄλλως ἄνθρωπος τὸ μὲν θεραπεῦον ὑπερφρονεῖν , τὸ δὲ μὴ ὑπεῖκον θαυμάζειν .
for in other instances, as well as theirs, man is naturally inclined to despise those who court him and respect those who do not stoop to him.


3.39.6
1985
κολασθέντων δὲ καὶ νῦν ἀξίως τῆς ἀδικίας , καὶ μὴ τοῖς μὲν ὀλίγοις ἡ αἰτία προστεθῇ , τὸν δὲ δῆμον ἀπολύσητε .
But let them even now be punished as their crime deserves; and let not the guilt attach to the aristocracy, while you acquit the commons.


3.39.6
1986
πάντες γὰρ ὑμῖν γε ὁμοίως ἐπέθεντο , οἷς γ’ ἐξῆν ὡς ἡμᾶς τραπομένοις νῦν πάλιν ἐν τῇ πόλει εἶναι ·
For at any rate they all alike attacked  since they might have come over to us, and so have been now in possession of their city again.


3.39.6
1987
ἀλλὰ τὸν μετὰ τῶν ὀλίγων κίνδυνον ἡγησάμενοι βεβαιότερον ξυναπέστησαν .
Thinking, however, the chance they ran with the aristocracy to be the safer, they joined them in revolting.


3.39.7
1988
τῶν τε ξυμμάχων σκέψασθε εἰ τοῖς τε ἀναγκασθεῖσιν ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων καὶ τοῖς ἑκοῦσιν ἀποστᾶσι τὰς αὐτὰς ζημίας προσθήσετε , τίνα οἴεσθε ὅντινα οὐ βραχείᾳ προφάσει ἀποστήσεσθαι , ὅταν ἢ κατορθώσαντι ἐλευθέρωσις ᾖ ἢ σφαλέντι μηδὲν παθεῖν ἀνήκεστον ;
if you attach the same penalties to those of the allies who were compelled by their enemies to revolt, and to those who did it voluntarily, which of them, think you, will not revolt on any slight pretext, when he either gains his liberation, if he succeed, or incurs no extreme suffering, if he fail?


3.39.8
1989
ἡμῖν δὲ πρὸς ἑκάστην πόλιν ἀποκεκινδυνεύσεται τά τε χρήματα καὶ αἱ ψυχαί , καὶ τυχόντες μὲν πόλιν ἐφθαρμένην παραλαβόντες τῆς ἔπειτα προσόδου , δι’ ἣν ἰσχύομεν , τὸ λοιπὸν στερήσεσθε , σφαλέντες δὲ πολεμίους πρὸς τοῖς ὑπάρχουσιν ἕξομεν , καὶ ὃν χρόνον τοῖς νῦν καθεστηκόσι δεῖ ἐχθροῖς ἀνθίστασθαι , τοῖς οἰκείοις ξυμμάχοις πολεμήσομεν .
And so we shall presently have to risk both our money and our lives against each separate state. And if we are successful, by taking possession of a ruined city, you will hereafter be deprived of all. future revenue from it—in which our strength consists; while if we fail, we shall have fresh enemies in addition to those we have already; and during the time that we ought to be opposing our present foes, we shall be engaged in hostilities with our own allies.


3.40.1
1990
&quot; οὔκουν δεῖ προθεῖναι ἐλπίδα οὔτε λόγῳ πιστὴν οὔτε χρήμασιν ὠνητήν , ὡς ξυγγνώμην ἁμαρτεῖν ἀνθρωπίνως λήψονται .
" You ought not therefore to hold out any hope, either relying on oratory or purchased with money, of their receiving allowance for having erred through human infirmity.


3.40.1
1991
ἄκοντες μὲν γὰρ οὐκ ἔβλαψαν , εἰδότες δὲ ἐπεβούλευσαν ·
For they did not involuntarily hurt you, but wittingly plotted against you;


3.40.1
1992
ξύγγνωμον δ’ ἐστὶ τὸ ἀκούσιον .
and it is only what is involuntary what can claim allowance."


3.40.2
1993
ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν καὶ τότε πρῶτον καὶ νῦν διαμάχομαι μὴ μεταγνῶναι ὑμᾶς τὰ προδεδογμένα , μηδὲ τρισὶ τοῖς ἀξυμφορωτάτοις τῇ ἀρχῇ , οἴκτῳ καὶ ἡδονῇ λόγων καὶ ἐπιεικείᾳ , ἁμαρτάνειν .
" I, then, both on that first occasion [so advised you], and now contend that you should not rescind your former resolutions, nor err through three things, the most inexpedient for empire, namely, pity delight in oratory, and lenity."


3.40.3
1994
ἔλεός τε γὰρ πρὸς τοὺς ὁμοίους δίκαιος ἀντιδίδοσθαι , καὶ μὴ πρὸς τοὺς οὔτ’ ἀντοικτιοῦντας ἐξ ἀνάγκης τε καθεστῶτας αἰεὶ πολεμίους ·
" For pity is properly felt towards those of a kindred temper, and not towards those who will not feel it in return, but are of necessity our enemies for ever.


3.40.3
1995
οἵ τε τέρποντες λόγῳ ῥήτορες ἕξουσι καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις ἐλάσσοσιν ἀγῶνα , καὶ μὴ ἐν ᾧ ἡ μὲν πόλις βραχέα ἡσθεῖσα μεγάλα ζημιώσεται , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐκ τοῦ εὖ εἰπεῖν τὸ παθεῖν εὖ ἀντιλήψονται ·
And the orators who delight us with their language will have a field in other subjects of less importance, instead of one in which the state, after being a little pleased, will pay a great penalty; while they themselves from their good speaking will receive good treatment in return.


3.40.3
1996
καὶ ἡ ἐπιείκεια πρὸς τοὺς μέλλοντας ἐπιτηδείους καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ἔσεσθαι μᾶλλον δίδοται ἢ πρὸς τοὺς ὁμοίους τε καὶ οὐδὲν ἧσσον πολεμίους ὑπολειπομένους .
And lenity is shown to those who will be well-disposed in future, rather than to those who remain just what they were, and not at all less hostile.


3.40.4
1997
ἕν τε ξυνελὼν λέγω ·
" To sum up in one word,


3.40.4
1998
πειθόμενοι μὲν ἐμοὶ τά τε δίκαια ἐς Μυτιληναίους καὶ τὰ ξύμφορα ἅμα ποιήσετε , ἄλλως δὲ γνόντες τοῖς μὲν οὐ χαριεῖσθε , ὑμᾶς δὲ αὐτοὺς μᾶλλον δικαιώσεσθε .
if you are persuaded by me, you will do what is just towards the Mytilenaeans, and at the same time expedient; but if you decide otherwise, you will not oblige, but will rather pass sentence upon yourselves.


3.40.4
1999
εἰ γὰρ οὗτοι ὀρθῶς ἀπέστησαν , ὑμεῖς ἂν οὐ χρεὼν ἄρχοιτε .
For if they were right in revolting, you cannot properly maintain your empire.


3.40.4
2000
εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ οὐ προσῆκον ὅμως ἀξιοῦτε τοῦτο δρᾶν , παρὰ τὸ εἰκός τοι καὶ τούσδε ξυμφόρως δεῖ κολάζεσθαι , ἢ παύεσθαι τῆς ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἀκινδύνου ἀνδραγαθίζεσθαι .
If, however, you determine to do so, even though it is not proper, you must also, overlooking what is right, punish these men from regard to expediency, or else give up your empire, and act the honest man without danger.


3.40.5
2001
τῇ τε αὐτῇ ζημίᾳ ἀξιώσατε ἀμύνασθαι καὶ μὴ ἀναλγητότεροι οἱ διαφεύγοντες τῶν ἐπιβουλευσάντων φανῆναι , ἐνθυμηθέντες ἃ εἰκὸς ἦν αὐτοὺς ποιῆσαι κρατήσαντας ὑμῶν , ἄλλως τε καὶ προϋπάρξαντας ἀδικίας .
" considering what they would probably have done, if they had prevailed over you; especially, as they were the first; to begin the wrong. For it is those who do ill to any one without reason, that persecute him most bitterly, nay, even to the death, from suspicion of the danger of their enemy's being spared;"


3.40.6
2002
μάλιστα δὲ οἱ μὴ ξὺν προφάσει τινὰ κακῶς ποιοῦντες ἐπεξέρχονται καὶ διολλύναι , τὸν κίνδυνον ὑφορώμενοι τοῦ ὑπολειπομένου ἐχθροῦ ·
"since he who has suffered evil without any necessity, but by provoking it himself, is more bitter, if he escape, than one who was an enemy on equal terms.


3.40.6
2003
ὁ γὰρ μὴ ξὺν ἀνάγκῃ τι παθὼν χαλεπώτερος διαφυγὼν τοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ἴσης ἐχθροῦ .
Be not therefore traitors to your own cause;


3.40.7
2004
&quot; μὴ οὖν προδόται γένησθε ὑμῶν αὐτῶν , γενόμενοι δ’ ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τῇ γνώμῃ τοῦ πάσχειν καὶ ὡς πρὸ παντὸς ἂν ἐτιμήσασθε αὐτοὺς χειρώσασθαι , νῦν ἀνταπόδοτε μὴ μαλακισθέντες πρὸς τὸ παρὸν αὐτίκα μηδὲ τοῦ ἐπικρεμασθέντος ποτὲ δεινοῦ ἀμνημονοῦντες .
" but bringing yourselves in feeling as near as possible to the actual state of suffering, and reflecting how you would in that case have valued their subjection above everything, now pay them back in return, not indulging in weakness at the present moment, nor forgetting the danger which once hung over you.


3.40.7
2005
κολάσατε δὲ ἀξίως τούτους τε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ξυμμάχοις παράδειγμα σαφὲς καταστήσατε , ὃς ἂν ἀφιστῆται , θανάτῳ ζημιωσόμενον .
Punish these men, I say, as they deserve; and give a striking example to the rest of your allies, that whoever revolts will pay the penalty for it with his life.


3.40.7
2006
τόδε γὰρ ἢν γνῶσιν , ἧσσον τῶν πολεμίων ἀμελήσαντες τοῖς ὑμετέροις αὐτῶν μαχεῖσθε ξυμμάχοις &quot; .
For if they know this, you will less frequently have to neglect your enemies, while you are fighting with your own confederates."


3.41.1
2007
τοιαῦτα μὲν ὁ Κλέων εἶπεν ·
To this effect spoke Cleon.


3.41.1
2008
μετὰ δ’ αὐτὸν Διόδοτος ὁ Εὐκράτους , ὅσπερ καὶ ἐν τῇ προτέρᾳ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἀντέλεγε μάλιστα μὴ ἀποκτεῖναι Μυτιληναίους , παρελθὼν καὶ τότε ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
After him Diodotus son of Eucrates, who in the former assembly spoke most strongly against putting the Mytilenaeans to death, came forward then also, and said as follows.


3.42.1
2009
&quot; οὔτε τοὺς προθέντας τὴν διαγνώμην αὖθις περὶ Μυτιληναίων αἰτιῶμαι , οὔτε τοὺς μεμφομένους μὴ πολλάκις περὶ τῶν μεγίστων βουλεύεσθαι ἐπαινῶ , νομίζω δὲ δύο τὰ ἐναντιώτατα εὐβουλίᾳ εἶναι , τάχος τε καὶ ὀργήν , ὧν τὸ μὲν μετὰ ἀνοίας φιλεῖ γίγνεσθαι , τὸ δὲ μετὰ ἀπαιδευσίας καὶ βραχύτητος γνώμης .
"I neither blame those who have a second time proposed the discussion of the case of the Mytilenaeans, nor commend those who object to repeated deliberation on the most important subjects; but I think that the two things most opposed to good counsel are hasten and passion one of which is generally the companion of folly, and the other of coarseness and narrowness of mind.


3.42.2
2010
τούς τε λόγους ὅστις διαμάχεται μὴ διδασκάλους τῶν πραγμάτων γίγνεσθαι , ἢ ἀξύνετός ἐστιν ἢ ἰδίᾳ τι αὐτῷ διαφέρει ·
And whoever contends that words are not to be the exponents of measures, is either wanting in understanding, or self-interested:


3.42.2
2011
ἀξύνετος μέν , εἰ ἄλλῳ τινὶ ἡγεῖται περὶ τοῦ μέλλοντος δυνατὸν εἶναι καὶ μὴ ἐμφανοῦς φράσαι , διαφέρει δ’ αὐτῷ , εἰ βουλόμενός τι αἰσχρὸν πεῖσαι εὖ μὲν εἰπεῖν οὐκ ἂν ἡγεῖται περὶ τοῦ μὴ καλοῦ δύνασθαι , εὖ δὲ διαβαλὼν ἐκπλῆξαι ἂν τούς τε ἀντεροῦντας καὶ τοὺς ἀκουσομένους .
wanting in understanding if he thinks it possible to express himself many other way on what is future and not certain; self-interested, if, when wishing to persuade to something base, he thinks that he could not speak to his credit on a discreditable subject, but that by clever calumniation he might confound both his opponents and audience.


3.42.3
2012
χαλεπώτατοι δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ χρήμασι προσκατηγοροῦντες ἐπίδειξίν τινα .
But most cruel of all are those who charge us besides with a display of rhetoric for pecuniary motives.


3.42.3
2013
εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἀμαθίαν κατῃτιῶντο , ὁ μὴ πείσας ἀξυνετώτερος ἂν δόξας εἶναι ἢ ἀδικώτερος ἀπεχώρει ·
For if the only imputed ignorance, he who failed in carrying his point would retire with a character for want of understanding, rather than of honesty:


3.42.3
2014
ἀδικίας δ’ ἐπιφερομένης πείσας τε ὕποπτος γίγνεται καὶ μὴ τυχὼν μετὰ ἀξυνεσίας καὶ ἄδικος .
but when a charge of dishonesty is brought against him, if successful, he is suspected; and if unsuccessful, together with his inability, he is also thought dishonest.


3.42.4
2015
ἥ τε πόλις οὐκ ὠφελεῖται ἐν τῷ τοιῷδε ·
And the state is not benefited by such a system;


3.42.4
2016
φόβῳ γὰρ ἀποστερεῖται τῶν ξυμβούλων .
for through fear it is deprived of its counsellors.


3.42.4
2017
καὶ πλεῖστ’ ἂν ὀρθοῖτο ἀδυνάτους λέγειν ἔχουσα τοὺς τοιούτους τῶν πολιτῶν ·
Most prosperous indeed would it be, if such of its citizens were incapable of speaking;


3.42.4
2018
ἐλάχιστα γὰρ ἂν πεισθεῖεν ἁμαρτάνειν .
for then they would be less often persuaded to do wrong.


3.42.5
2019
χρὴ δὲ τὸν μὲν ἀγαθὸν πολίτην μὴ ἐκφοβοῦντα τοὺς ἀντεροῦντας , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου φαίνεσθαι ἄμεινον λέγοντα , τὴν δὲ σώφρονα πόλιν τῷ τε πλεῖστα εὖ βουλεύοντι μὴ προστιθέναι τιμήν , ἀλλὰ μηδ’ ἐλασσοῦν τῆς ὑπαρχούσης , καὶ τὸν μὴ τυχόντα γνώμης οὐχ ὅπως ζημιοῦν ἀλλὰ μηδ’ ἀτιμάζειν .
But the good citizen ought to show himself the better speaker not by terrifying his opponent, but by meeting him on equal terms; and the state that acts wisely should not, indeed, confer honour on the man who most frequently gives good advice, but neither should it detract from what he enjoys already; and so far from punishing him who is wrong in his judgment, it should not even degrade him.


3.42.6
2020
οὕτω γὰρ ὅ τε κατορθῶν ἥκιστα ἂν ἐπὶ τῷ ἔτι μειζόνων ἀξιοῦσθαι παρὰ γνώμην τι καὶ πρὸς χάριν λέγοι , ὅ τε μὴ ἐπιτυχὼν ὀρέγοιτο τῷ αὐτῷ χαριζόμενός τι καὶ αὐτὸς προσάγεσθαι τὸ πλῆθος .
For so the successful counsellor would be least tempted to speak any thing contrary to his real opinion, in order to gratify his nearers; and the unsuccessful one would be least anxious by the same means of gratification to bring over the multitude to  side also.


3.43.1
2021
&quot; ὧν ἡμεῖς τ- ἐναντία δρῶμεν , καὶ προσέτι ἤν τις καὶ ὑποπτεύηται κέρδους μὲν ἕνεκα τὰ βέλτιστα δὲ ὅμως λέγειν , φθονήσαντες τῆς οὐ βεβαίου δοκήσεως τῶν κερδῶν τὴν φανερὰν ὠφελίαν τῆς πόλεως ἀφαιρούμεθα .
"But we do the contrary of this; and moreover, if any one be suspected of speaking with a view to his own advantage, though at the same time what is best, through grudging him the gain of which we have but an uncertain idea, we deprive the state of its certain benefit.


3.43.2
2022
καθέστηκε δὲ τ- ἀγαθὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ εὐθέος λεγόμενα μηδὲν ἀνυποπτότερα εἶναι τῶν κακῶν , ὥστε δεῖν ὁμοίως τόν τε τὰ δεινότατα βουλόμενον πεῖσαι ἀπάτῃ προσάγεσθαι τὸ πλῆθος καὶ τὸν τὰ ἀμείνω λέγοντα ψευσάμενον πιστὸν γενέσθαι .
And thus good advice, given in a straightforward manner, has come to be no less suspected than bad; so that it is equally necessary for one who wishes to carry the most dreadful measures to win over the multitude by trickery, and for one who speaks on the better side to gain credit by falsehood.


3.43.3
2023
μόνην τε πόλιν διὰ τὰς περινοίας εὖ ποιῆσαι ἐκ τοῦ προφανοῦς μὴ ἐξαπατήσαντα ἀδύνατον ·
And the state alone it is impossible, owing to these over-wise notions, to serve in an open manner and without deceiving it;


3.43.3
2024
ὁ γὰρ διδοὺς φανερῶς τι ἀγαθὸν ἀνθυποπτεύεται ἀφανῶς πῃ πλέον ἕξειν .
for he who openly confers any good upon it is suspected of getting secretly, in some way or other, an advantage in return.


3.43.4
2025
χρὴ δὲ πρὸς τὰ μέγιστα καὶ ἐν τῷ τοιῷδε ἀξιοῦν τι ἡμᾶς περαιτέρω προνοοῦντας λέγειν ὑμῶν τῶν δι’ ὀλίγου σκοπούντων , ἄλλως τε καὶ ὑπεύθυνον τὴν παραίνεσιν ἔχοντας πρὸς ἀνεύθυνον τὴν ὑμετέραν ἀκρόασιν .
Now on subjects of the greatest importance, and with such an estimate of our conduct, we [orators] ought to speak with more extensive forethought than you who take but an off-hand view of measures; especially as we are responsible for the advice we give, whereas you are irresponsible for listening to it.


3.43.5
2026
εἰ γὰρ ὅ τε πείσας καὶ ὁ ἐπισπόμενος ὁμοίως ἐβλάπτοντο , σωφρονέστερον ἂν ἐκρίνετε ·
For if he who offered counsel, and he who followed it, suffered alike, you would judge more prudently.


3.43.5
2027
νῦν δὲ πρὸς ὀργὴν ἥντινα τύχητε ἔστιν ὅτε σφαλέντες τὴν τοῦ πείσαντος μίαν γνώμην ζημιοῦτε καὶ οὐ τὰς ὑμετέρας αὐτῶν , εἰ πολλαὶ οὖσαι ξυνεξήμαρτον .
But as it is, through whatever passion you may at any time have met with disasters, you punish the single judgment of the man who persuaded you, and not your own, for having so numerously joined in the blunder.


3.44.1
2028
&quot; ἐγὼ δὲ παρῆλθον οὔτε ἀντερῶν περὶ Μυτιληναίων οὔτε κατηγορήσων .
"I came forward, however, neither to speak against any one in defense of the Mytilenaeans, nor to accuse any one.


3.44.1
2029
οὐ γὰρ περὶ τῆς ἐκείνων ἀδικίας ἡμῖν ὁ ἀγών , εἰ σωφρονοῦμεν , ἀλλὰ περὶ τῆς ἡμετέρας εὐβουλίας .
For the question we have to decide is not, if we take a wise view of it, respecting their guilt, but respecting our taking good counsel.


3.44.2
2030
ἤν τε γὰρ ἀποφήνω πάνυ ἀδικοῦντας αὐτούς , οὐ διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἀποκτεῖναι κελεύσω , εἰ μὴ ξυμφέρον , ἤν τε καὶ ἔχοντάς τι ξυγγνώμης † εἶεν † , εἰ τῇ πόλει μὴ ἀγαθὸν φαίνοιτο .
For though I should prove them to be utterly guilty, I will not for that reason also bid you to put them to death, unless it were expedient: and though they might claim some allowance,[I would not bid you make it,] unless it should appear good for the state.


3.44.3
2031
νομίζω δὲ περὶ τοῦ μέλλοντος ἡμᾶς μᾶλλον βουλεύεσθαι ἢ τοῦ παρόντος .
But I am of opinion that we are deliberating for the future, rather than the present;


3.44.3
2032
καὶ τοῦτο ὃ μάλιστα Κλέων ἰσχυρίζεται , ἐς τὸ λοιπὸν ξυμφέρον ἔσεσθαι πρὸς τὸ ἧσσον ἀφίστασθαι θάνατον ζημίαν προθεῖσι , καὶ αὐτὸς περὶ τοῦ ἐς τὸ μέλλον καλῶς ἔχοντος ἀντισχυριζόμενος τ- ἐναντία γιγνώσκω .
and as to what Cleon most positively asserts, that it will be advantageous to us in the future, with a view to less frequent revolts, if we hold out death as the penalty; I too as positively contradict him, with regard to what is good for the future, and maintain the opposite opinion.


3.44.4
2033
καὶ οὐκ ἀξιῶ ὑμᾶς τῷ εὐπρεπεῖ τοῦ ἐκείνου λόγου τὸ χρήσιμον τοῦ ἐμοῦ ἀπώσασθαι .
And I beg you not to reject the utility of my advice for the plausibility of his.


3.44.4
2034
δικαιότερος γὰρ ὢν αὐτοῦ ὁ λόγος πρὸς τὴν νῦν ὑμετέραν ὀργὴν ἐς Μυτιληναίους τάχ’ ἂν ἐπισπάσαιτο ·
For his words might perhaps attract you, through being more just with regard to your present displeasure against the Mytilenaeans: but we are not holding a judicial inquiry in their case, that we should want what is just;


3.44.4
2035
ἡμεῖς δὲ οὐ δικαζόμεθα πρὸς αὐτούς , ὥστε τῶν δικαίων δεῖν , ἀλλὰ βουλευόμεθα περὶ αὐτῶν , ὅπως χρησίμως ἕξουσιν .
but are deliberating respecting them, how they may be of service to us.


3.45.1
2036
&quot; ἐν οὖν ταῖς πόλεσι πολλῶν θανάτου ζημίαι πρόκεινται , καὶ οὐκ ἴσων τῷδε , ἀλλ’ ἐλασσόνων ἁμαρτημάτων ·
"Now the penalty of death has been enacted in states for many offenses, and those not equal to this, but less heinous;


3.45.1
2037
ὅμως δὲ τῇ ἐλπίδι ἐπαιρόμενοι κινδυνεύουσι , καὶ οὐδείς πω καταγνοὺς ἑαυτοῦ μὴ περιέσεσθαι τῷ ἐπιβουλεύματι ἦλθεν ἐς τὸ δεινόν .
and yet, urged on by hope, men venture to commit them; and no one ever yet came into danger with a conviction of his own mind that he would not succeed in his attempt.


3.45.2
2038
πόλις τε ἀφισταμένη τίς πω ἥσσω τῇ δοκήσει ἔχουσα τὴν παρασκευὴν ἢ οἰκείαν ἢ ἄλλων ξυμμαχίᾳ τούτῳ ἐπεχείρησεν ;
What city, too, when bent on revolt, ever attempted it with deficient resources—according to its own idea—either internal, or by means of alliance with others?


3.45.3
2039
πεφύκασί τε ἅπαντες καὶ ἰδίᾳ καὶ δημοσίᾳ ἁμαρτάνειν , καὶ οὐκ ἔστι νόμος ὅστις ἀπείρξει τούτου , ἐπεὶ διεξεληλύθασί γε διὰ πασῶν τῶν ζημιῶν οἱ ἄνθρωποι προστιθέντες , εἴ πως ἧσσον ἀδικοῖντο ὑπὸ τῶν κακούργων .
Indeed all men, both in private and public capacity, are naturally disposed to do wrong, and there is no law that will keep them from it;


3.45.3
2040
καὶ εἰκὸς τὸ πάλαι τῶν μεγίστων ἀδικημάτων μαλακωτέρας κεῖσθαι αὐτάς , παραβαινομένων δὲ τῷ χρόνῳ ἐς τὸν θάνατον αἱ πολλαὶ ἀνήκουσιν ·
at least men have gone through all kinds of punishment in their enactments, to try if by any means they might be less injured by evil-doers, and it is probable that in early times the punishments for the greatest offenses were more lenient;


3.45.3
2041
καὶ τοῦτο ὅμως παραβαίνεται .
but as they are disregarded, they generally, in the course of time, extend to death;


3.45.4
2042
ἢ τοίνυν δεινότερόν τι τούτου δέος εὑρετέον ἐστὶν ἢ τόδε γε οὐδὲν ἐπίσχει , ἀλλ’ ἡ μὲν πενία ἀνάγκῃ τὴν τόλμαν παρέχουσα , ἡ δ’ ἐξουσία ὕβρει τὴν πλεονεξίαν καὶ φρονήματι , αἱ δ’ ἄλλαι ξυντυχίαι ὀργῇ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὡς ἑκάστη τις κατέχεται ὑπ’ ἀνηκέστου τινὸς κρείσσονος ἐξάγουσιν ἐς τοὺς κινδύνους .
and still even this is disregarded. Either, then, some fear more dreadful than this must be discovered, or this, at any rate, does not restrain men: but poverty inspiring ing boldness through necessity, and larger means inspiring ambition though insolence and pride, and the other conditions of life through some human passion or other, according as they are severally enslaved by some fatal and overpowering one, lead men on to dangers.


3.45.5
2043
ἥ τε ἐλπὶς καὶ ὁ ἔρως ἐπὶ παντί , ὁ μὲν ἡγούμενος , ἡ δ’ ἐφεπομένη , καὶ ὁ μὲν τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν ἐκφροντίζων , ἡ δὲ τὴν εὐπορίαν τῆς τύχης ὑποτιθεῖσα , πλεῖστα βλάπτουσι , καὶ ὄντα ἀφανῆ κρείσσω ἐστὶ τῶν ὁρωμένων δεινῶν .
Moreover, hope and desire for every thing, the one taking the lead, and the other following; and the one devising the attempt, while the other suggests the facility of succeeding in it; cause the most numerous disasters; and though unseen, they are more influential than the dangers that are seen. Fortune, too, aids them no less in urging men on;


3.45.6
2044
καὶ ἡ τύχη ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς οὐδὲν ἔλασσον ξυμβάλλεται ἐς τὸ ἐπαίρειν ·
for by sometimes siding them unexpectedly, she induces them to run the risk even with inferior means;


3.45.6
2045
ἀδοκήτως γὰρ ἔστιν ὅτε παρισταμένη καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὑποδεεστέρων κινδυνεύειν τινὰ προάγει , καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον τὰς πόλεις , ὅσῳ περὶ τῶν μεγίστων τε , ἐλευθερίας ἢ ἄλλων ἀρχῆς , καὶ μετὰ πάντων ἕκαστος ἀλογίστως ἐπὶ πλέον τι αὑτὸν ἐδόξασεν .
especially in the case of states, in as much as the venture is for the greatest object, namely, freedom, or empire over others: and as each individual, when acting in concert with all, unreasonably carries his ideas to an extravagant length concerning them.


3.45.7
2046
ἁπλῶς τε ἀδύνατον καὶ πολλῆς εὐηθείας ,ὅστις οἴεται τῆς ἀνθρωπείας φύσεως ὁρμωμένης προθύμως τι πρᾶξαι ἀποτροπήν τινα ἔχειν ἢ νόμων ἰσχύι ἢ ἄλλῳ τῳ δεινῷ .
In short, it is impossible [to remedy the evil], and the man is very simple who thinks, that when human nature is eagerly set on doing a thing, he has any means of diverting it, either by the rigour of laws, or any other kind of terror.


3.46.1
2047
&quot; οὔκουν χρὴ οὔτε τοῦ θανάτου τῇ ζημίᾳ ὡς ἐχεγγύῳ πιστεύσαντας χεῖρον βουλεύσασθαι οὔτε ἀνέλπιστον καταστῆσαι τοῖς ἀποστᾶσιν ὡς οὐκ ἔσται μεταγνῶναι καὶ ὅτι ἐν βραχυτάτῳ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν καταλῦσαι .
"We must not, then, either take bad counsel through trusting to the punishment of death as a thing to be relied on, or leave to those who have revolted no hope of being allowed to change their minds, and wipe out their offence in as short a time as possible.


3.46.2
2048
σκέψασθε γὰρ ὅτι νῦν μέν , ἤν τις καὶ ἀποστᾶσα πόλις γνῷ μὴ περιεσομένη , ἔλθοι ἂν ἐς ξύμβασιν δυνατὴ οὖσα ἔτι τὴν δαπάνην ἀποδοῦναι καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ὑποτελεῖν ·
For consider that at present, if any city, even after revolting, find that it will not succeed, it would come to terms while it has still means of refunding the expenses, and of paying tribute in future.


3.46.2
2049
ἐκείνως δὲ τίνα οἴεσθε ἥντινα οὐκ ἄμεινον μὲν ἢ νῦν παρασκευάσεσθαι , πολιορκίᾳ δὲ παρατενεῖσθαι ἐς τ- ἔσχατον , εἰ τὸ αὐτὸ δύναται σχολῇ καὶ ταχὺ ξυμβῆναι ;
But in the other case, which of them, think you, would not make better preparations for the attempt than they do now, and hold out against its besiegers to the utmost, if it is all one whether it surrenders slowly or quickly?


3.46.3
2050
ἡμῖν τε πῶς οὐ βλάβη δαπανᾶν καθημένοις διὰ τὸ ἀξύμβατον καί , ἢν ἕλωμεν , πόλιν ἐφθαρμένην παραλαβεῖν καὶ τῆς προσόδου τὸ λοιπὸν ἀπ’ αὐτῆς στέρεσθαι ;
And how can it fail to be injurious for us to be put to expense by sitting down before it, because it will not surrender;


3.46.3
2051
ἰσχύομεν δὲ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους τῷδε .
and if we take the city, to recover it in a ruined condition, and be deprived of the revenue from it in future?


3.46.4
2052
ὥστε οὐ δικαστὰς ὄντας δεῖ ἡμᾶς μᾶλλον τῶν ἐξαμαρτανόντων ἀκριβεῖς βλάπτεσθαι ἢ ὁρᾶν ὅπως ἐς τὸν ἔπειτα χρόνον μετρίως κολάζοντες ταῖς πόλεσιν ἕξομεν ἐς χρημάτων λόγον ἰσχυούσαις χρῆσθαι , καὶ τὴν φυλακὴν μὴ ἀπὸ τῶν νόμων τῆς δεινότητος ἀξιοῦν ποιεῖσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων τῆς ἐπιμελείας .
For our strength against the enemy lies in this. So then we must not hurt ourselves, by being strict judges of the offenders, but rather see how, by punishing them moderately, we may be able in future to avail ourselves of the cities with unimpaired mean the score of money; and we must resolve to derive our protection not from severity of laws, but from attention to deeds. The very contrary of which we do at present;


3.46.5
2053
οὗ νῦν τ- ἐναντίον δρῶντες , ἤν τινα ἐλεύθερον καὶ βίᾳ ἀρχόμενον εἰκότως πρὸς αὐτονομίαν ἀποστάντα χειρωσώμεθα , χαλεπῶς οἰόμεθα χρῆναι τιμωρεῖσθαι .
and we have subdued any power that was [once] free, and, when harshly governed, naturally revolted for its independence, we fancy that we are bound to avenge ourselves with severity.


3.46.6
2054
χρὴ δὲ τοὺς ἐλευθέρους οὐκ ἀφισταμένους σφόδρα κολάζειν , ἀλλὰ πρὶν ἀποστῆναι σφόδρα φυλάσσειν καὶ προκαταλαμβάνειν ὅπως μηδ’ ἐς ἐπίνοιαν τούτου ἴωσι , κρατήσαντάς τε ὅτι ἐπ’ ἐλάχιστον τὴν αἰτίαν ἐπιφέρειν .
But in dealing wit freemen, we must not  them rigorously when revolt, but watch them rigorously  they revolt and prevent their even coming to the thought of it; and when we have mastery of them, we should attach the guilt to as few as possible.


3.47.1
2055
&quot; ὑμεῖς δὲ σκέψασθε ὅσον ἂν καὶ τοῦτο ἁμαρτάνοιτε Κλέωνι πειθόμενοι .
"Now consider what an error you would commit in this also, if persuaded by Cleon.


3.47.2
2056
νῦν μὲν γὰρ ὑμῖν ὁ δῆμος ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν εὔνους ἐστί , καὶ ἢ οὐ ξυναφίσταται τοῖς ὀλίγοις ἤ , ἐὰν βιασθῇ , ὑπάρχει τοῖς ἀποστήσασι πολέμιος εὐθύς , καὶ τῆς ἀντικαθισταμένης πόλεως τὸ πλῆθος ξύμμαχον ἔχοντες ἐς πόλεμον ἐπέρχεσθε .
For at present the commons in all the states are well disposed towards you, and either do not revolt with the aristocratical party, or if compelled to do so, are straightway hostile to those who made them; and you have the mass of the city opposed to you on your side, when you proceed to war.


3.47.3
2057
εἰ δὲ διαφθερεῖτε τὸν δῆμον τὸν Μυτιληναίων , ὃς οὔτε μετέσχε τῆς ἀποστάσεως , ἐπειδή τε ὅπλων ἐκράτησεν , ἑκὼν παρέδωκε τὴν πόλιν , πρῶτον μὲν ἀδικήσετε τοὺς εὐεργέτας κτείνοντες , ἔπειτα καταστήσετε τοῖς δυνατοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὃ βούλονται μάλιστα ·
But if you butcher the commons of Mytilene, who took no part in the revolt, and when they had got possession of arms, voluntarily gave up the city;


3.47.3
2058
ἀφιστάντες γὰρ τὰς πόλεις τὸν δῆμον εὐθὺς ξύμμαχον ἕξουσι , προδειξάντων ὑμῶν τὴν αὐτὴν ζημίαν τοῖς τε ἀδικοῦσιν ὁμοίως κεῖσθαι καὶ τοῖς μή .
in the first place you will act unjustly by slaying your benefactors; and in the next you will produce for the higher classes of men a result which they most desire; for when they lead their cities to revolt, they will immediately have the commons on their side, because you had shown them beforehand that the same penalty is appointed for those who are guilty and those who are not.


3.47.4
2059
δεῖ δέ , καὶ εἰ ἠδίκησαν , μὴ προσποιεῖσθαι , ὅπως ὃ μόνον ἡμῖν ἔτι ξύμμαχόν ἐστι μὴ πολέμιον γένηται .
On the contrary, even if they  guilty, you ought to pretend not to notice it; that the only class still allied with us may not become hostile to us.


3.47.5
2060
καὶ τοῦτο πολλῷ ξυμφορώτερον ἡγοῦμαι ἐς τὴν κάθεξιν τῆς ἀρχῆς , ἑκόντας ἡμᾶς ἀδικηθῆναι ἢ δικαίως οὓς μὴ δεῖ διαφθεῖραι ·
And this I consider far more beneficial towards retaining our empire—that we should voluntarily be treated with injustice—than that with justice we should put to the sword those whom we ought not.


3.47.5
2061
καὶ τὸ Κλέωνος τὸ αὐτὸ δίκαιον καὶ ξύμφορον τῆς τιμωρίας οὐχ εὑρίσκεται ἐν αὐτῷ δυνατὸν ὂν ἅμα γίγνεσθαι .
And so the identity of the justice and expediency of the punishment, which Cleon asserts, is found impossible to exist therein.


3.48.1
2062
&quot; ὑμεῖς δὲ γνόντες ἀμείνω τάδε εἶναι καὶ μήτε οἴκτῳ πλέον νείμαντες μήτ’ ἐπιεικείᾳ , οἷς οὐδὲ ἐγὼ ἐῶ προσάγεσθαι , ἀπ’ αὐτῶν δὲ τῶν παραινουμένων πείθεσθέ μοι Μυτιληναίων οὓς μὲν Πάχης ἀπέπεμψεν ὡς ἀδικοῦντας κρῖναι καθ’ ἡσυχίαν , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους ἐᾶν οἰκεῖν .
" Being convinced then that this is the better course, and not allowing too much weight either to pity or to lenity (for neither do I, [any more than Cleon,] wish you to be influenced by these,) but judging from the advice itself which is given you, be persuaded by me to try calmly those of the Mytilenaeans whom Paches sent off as guilty, and to allow the rest to live where they are."


3.48.2
2063
τάδε γὰρ ἔς τε τὸ μέλλον ἀγαθὰ καὶ τοῖς πολεμίοις ἤδη φοβερά ·
For this is both profitable for the future, and terrible to your enemies at the present moment;


3.48.2
2064
ὅστις γὰρ εὖ βουλεύεται πρὸς τοὺς ἐναντίους κρείσσων ἐστὶν ἢ μετ’ ἔργων ἰσχύος ἀνοίᾳ ἐπιών &quot; .
since whoever takes good advice against his adversaries is stronger than one who recklessly proceeds against them with violence of action.


3.49.1
2065
τοιαῦτα δὲ ὁ Διόδοτος εἶπεν .
To this effect spoke Diodotus.


3.49.1
2066
ῥηθεισῶν δὲ τῶν γνωμῶν τούτων μάλιστα ἀντιπάλων πρὸς ἀλλήλας οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἦλθον μὲν ἐς ἀγῶνα ὅμως τῆς δόξης καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐν τῇ χειροτονίᾳ ἀγχώμαλοι , ἐκράτησε δὲ ἡ τοῦ Διοδότου .
These being the views that were expressed in most direct opposition to one another, the Athenians, notwithstanding [their wish to reconsider the question], came to a conflict of opinion respecting them, and were nearly matched in the voting, though that of Diodotus prevailed.


3.49.2
2067
καὶ τριήρη εὐθὺς ἄλλην ἀπέστελλον κατὰ σπουδήν , ὅπως μὴ φθασάσης τῆς προτέρας εὕρωσι διεφθαρμένην τὴν πόλιν ·
And they immediately despatched another trireme with all speed, that they might not find the city destroyed through the previous arrival of the first;


3.49.2
2068
προεῖχε δὲ ἡμέρᾳ καὶ νυκτὶ μάλιστα .
which had the start by a day and a night.


3.49.3
2069
παρασκευασάντων δὲ τῶν Μυτιληναίων πρέσβεων τῇ νηὶ οἶνον καὶ ἄλφιτα καὶ μεγάλα ὑποσχομένων , εἰ φθάσειαν , ἐγένετο σπουδὴ τοῦ πλοῦ τοιαύτη ὥστε ἤσθιόν τε ἅμα ἐλαύνοντες οἴνῳ καὶ ἐλαίῳ ἄλφιτα πεφυραμένα , καὶ οἱ μὲν ὕπνον ᾑροῦντο κατὰ μέρος , οἱ δὲ ἤλαυνον .
The Mytilenaean ambassadors having provided for the vessel wine and barley-cakes, and promising great rewards if they should arrive first, there was such haste in their course, that at the same time as they rowed they ate cakes kneaded with oil and wine; and some slept in turns, while others rowed.


3.49.4
2070
κατὰ τύχην δὲ πνεύματος οὐδενὸς ἐναντιωθέντος καὶ τῆς μὲν προτέρας νεὼς οὐ σπουδῇ πλεούσης ἐπὶ πρᾶγμα ἀλλόκοτον , ταύτης δὲ τοιούτῳ τρόπῳ ἐπειγομένης , ἡ μὲν ἔφθασε τοσοῦτον ὅσον Πάχητα ἀνεγνωκέναι τὸ ψήφισμα καὶ μέλλειν δράσειν τὰ δεδογμένα , ἡ δ’ ὑστέρα αὐτῆς ἐπικατάγεται καὶ διεκώλυσε μὴ διαφθεῖραι .
And as there happened to be no wind against them, and the former vessel did not sail in any haste on so horrible a business, while this hurried on in the manner described;


3.49.4
2071
παρὰ τοσοῦτον μὲν ἡ Μυτιλήνη ἦλθε κινδύνου .
though the other arrived so much first that Paches had read the decree, and was on the point of executing the sentence, the second came to land after it, and prevented the butchery. Into such imminent peril did Mytilene come.


3.50.1
2072
τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους ἄνδρας οὓς ὁ Πάχης ἀπέπεμψεν ὡς αἰτιωτάτους ὄντας τῆς ἀποστάσεως Κλέωνος γνώμῃ διέφθειραν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἦσαν δὲ ὀλίγῳ πλείους χιλίων ) , καὶ Μυτιληναίων τείχη καθεῖλον καὶ ναῦς παρέλαβον .
The other party, whom Paches had sent off as the chief authors of the revolt, the Athenians put to death, according to the advice of Cleon, amounting to rather more than one thousand. They also dismantled the walls of the Mytilenaeans, and seized their ships.


3.50.2
2073
ὕστερον δὲ φόρον μὲν οὐκ ἔταξαν Λεσβίοις , κλήρους δὲ ποιήσαντες τῆς γῆς πλὴν τῆς Μηθυμναίων τρισχιλίους τριακοσίους μὲν τοῖς θεοῖς ἱεροὺς ἐξεῖλον , ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς ἄλλους σφῶν αὐτῶν κληρούχους τοὺς λαχόντας ἀπέπεμψαν ·
After this they did not impose any tribute on the Lesbians, but having divided the land, excepting that of the Methymnaeans, into three thousand portions, they set apart three hundred of them as consecrated to the gods, and to the rest sent out as shareholders those of their own citizens to whose lot they had fallen;


3.50.2
2074
οἷς ἀργύριον Λέσβιοι ταξάμενοι τοῦ κλήρου ἑκάστου τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ δύο μνᾶς φέρειν αὐτοὶ εἰργάζοντο τὴν γῆν .
with whom the Lesbians having agreed to pay in money two mince a year for each portion, farmed the land themselves.


3.50.3
2075
παρέλαβον δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ πολίσματα οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὅσων Μυτιληναῖοι ἐκράτουν , καὶ ὑπήκουον ὕστερον Ἀθηναίων .
The Athenians also took possession of the towns on the continent of which the Mytilenaeans were masters, and they were afterwards subject to Athens.


3.50.3
2076
τὰ μὲν κατὰ Λέσβον οὕτως ἐγένετο .
Such then was the issue of affairs as regarded Lesbos.


3.51.1
2077
ἐν δὲ τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει μετὰ τὴν Λέσβου ἅλωσιν Ἀθηναῖοι Νικίου τοῦ Νικηράτου στρατηγοῦντος ἐστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Μινῴαν τὴν νῆσον , ἣ κεῖται πρὸ Μεγάρων ·
In the course of the same summer, after the reduction of Lesbos, the Athenians made an expedition under the command of Nicias, son of Niceratus, against the island of Minoa, which lies off Megara,


3.51.1
2078
ἐχρῶντο δὲ αὐτῇ πύργον ἐνοικοδομήσαντες οἱ Μεγαρῆς φρουρίῳ .
and which the Megareans used as a fortress, having built a tower on it.


3.51.2
2079
ἐβούλετο δὲ Νικίας τὴν φυλακὴν αὐτόθεν δι’ ἐλάσσονος τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ μὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ Βουδόρου καὶ τῆς Σαλαμῖνος εἶναι , τούς τε Πελοποννησίους , ὅπως μὴ ποιῶνται ἔκπλους αὐτόθεν λανθάνοντες τριήρων τε , οἷον καὶ τὸ πρὶν γενόμενον , καὶ λῃστῶν ἐκπομπαῖς , τοῖς τε Μεγαρεῦσιν ἅμα μηδὲν ἐσπλεῖν .
From this spot, being more close at hand, Nicias wished the Athenians to keep their guard [over Nisaea], instead of from Budorum and Salamis, and to prevent the Peloponnesians from sailing out thence unobserved, as was formerly the case, with triremes and privateers; and at the same time to see that nothing was imported by the Megareans.


3.51.3
2080
ἑλὼν οὖν ἀπὸ τῆς Νισαίας πρῶτον δύο πύργω προύχοντε μηχαναῖς ἐκ θαλάσσης καὶ τὸν ἔσπλουν ἐς τὸ μεταξὺ τῆς νήσου ἐλευθερώσας ἀπετείχιζε καὶ τὸ ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου , ᾗ κατὰ γέφυραν διὰ τενάγους ἐπιβοήθεια ἦν τῇ νήσῳ οὐ πολὺ διεχούσῃ τῆς ἠπείρου .
Having therefore in the first instance taken by engines from the sea two towers which projected on the side of Nisaea, and having cleared the entrance to the strait between the island [and the continent], he proceeded to cut off all communication on the side of the mainland also, where there was a passage by a bridge over a morass for succouring the island, which lay not far off from the continent.


3.51.4
2081
ὡς δὲ τοῦτο ἐξειργάσαντο ἐν ἡμέραις ὀλίγαις , ὕστερον δὴ καὶ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ τεῖχος ἐγκαταλιπὼν καὶ φρουρὰν ἀνεχώρησε τῷ στρατῷ .
This having been accomplished by them in a few days, he afterwards left works on the island also, with a garrison, and retired with his forces.


3.52.1
2082
ὑπὸ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τοῦ θέρους τούτου καὶ οἱ Πλαταιῆς οὐκέτι ἔχοντες σῖτον οὐδὲ δυνάμενοι πολιορκεῖσθαι ξυνέβησαν τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις τοιῷδε τρόπῳ .
It was also about the same period of this summer that the Plataeans, having no longer any provisions and being unable to endure the blockade, surrendered to the Peloponnesians in the following manner.


3.52.2
2083
προσέβαλλον αὐτῶν τῷ τείχει , οἱ δὲ οὐκ ἐδύναντο ἀμύνεσθαι .
The enemy assaulted their wall and they were incapable of defending it.


3.52.2
2084
γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος ἄρχων τὴν ἀσθένειαν αὐτῶν βίᾳ μὲν οὐκ ἐβούλετο ἑλεῖν ( εἰρημένον γὰρ ἦν αὐτῷ ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος , ὅπως , εἰ σπονδαὶ γίγνοιντό ποτε πρὸς Ἀθηναίους καὶ ξυγχωροῖεν ὅσα πολέμῳ χωρία ἔχουσιν ἑκάτεροι ἀποδίδοσθαι , μὴ ἀνάδοτος εἴη ἡ Πλάταια ὡς αὐτῶν ἑκόντων προσχωρησάντων ) , προσπέμπει δὲ αὐτοῖς κήρυκα λέγοντα , εἰ βούλονται παραδοῦναι τὴν πόλιν ἑκόντες τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ δικασταῖς ἐκείνοις χρήσασθαι , τούς τε ἀδίκους κολάζειν , παρὰ δίκην δὲ οὐδένα .
So when the Lacedaemonian commander was aware of their powerless condition, he did not wish to take it by storm, (for such were his instructions from Lacedaemon, in order that if a treaty should ever be made with the Athenians, and they should agree to restore such places as they had respectively taken in the war, Plataea might not be given up, on the strength of its inhabitants having voluntarily gone over to them,) but he sent to them a herald with this question, "Were they disposed voluntarily to surrender their city to the Lacedaemonians, and submit to them as their judges;


3.52.3
2085
τοσαῦτα μὲν ὁ κῆρυξ εἶπεν ·
"and that they should punish the guilty, but no one contrary to justice?"


3.52.3
2086
οἱ δέ ( ἦσαν γὰρ ἤδη ἐν τῷ ἀσθενεστάτῳ ) παρέδοσαν τὴν πόλιν .
Such were the words of the herald; and they, being now in a state of extreme weakness, surrendered the city.


3.52.3
2087
καὶ τοὺς Πλαταιᾶς ἔτρεφον οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἡμέρας τινάς , ἐν ὅσῳ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος δικασταὶ πέντε ἄνδρες ἀφίκοντο .
The Peloponnesians then fed the Plataeans for nine days, till the judges from Lacedaemon, five in number, arrived.


3.52.4
2088
ἐλθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν κατηγορία μὲν οὐδεμία προυτέθη , ἠρώτων δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐπικαλεσάμενοι τοσοῦτον μόνον , εἴ τι Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τῷ καθεστῶτι ἀγαθόν τι εἰργασμένοι εἰσίν .
When they were come, no charge was preferred against them; but they called them forward, and merely asked them this question, " Had they in any particular done the Lacedaemonians and the allies any service during the present war?"


3.52.5
2089
οἱ δ’ ἔλεγον αἰτησάμενοι μακρότερα εἰπεῖν καὶ προτάξαντες σφῶν αὐτῶν Ἀστύμαχόν τε τὸν Ἀσωπολάου καὶ Λάκωνα τὸν Αἰειμνήστου πρόξενον ὄντα Λακεδαιμονίων ·
They made a speech [in reply], for they had requested permission to speak at greater length, and had deputed to plead their cause Astymachus the son of Asopolaus, and Lacon the son of Aeimnestus,


3.52.5
2090
καὶ ἐπελθόντες ἔλεγον τοιάδε .
who came forward and said as follows:


3.53.1
2091
&quot; τὴν μὲν παράδοσιν τῆς πόλεως , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , πιστεύσαντες ὑμῖν ἐποιησάμεθα , οὐ τοιάνδε δίκην οἰόμενοι ὑφέξειν , νομιμωτέραν δέ τινα ἔσεσθαι , καὶ ἐν δικασταῖς οὐκ ἂν ἄλλοις δεξάμενοι , ὥσπερ καὶ ἐσμέν , γενέσθαι ἢ ὑμῖν , ἡγούμενοι τὸ ἴσον μάλιστ’ ἂν φέρεσθαι .
"The surrender of our city, Lacedaemonians, we made with full confidence in you, not supposing that we should be subjected to such a trial as this, but that it would be one more consistent with law; and with an agreement that we should not, as we now are, be at the mercy of any other judges but yourselves; thinking that so we should best obtain what was fair.


3.53.2
2092
νῦν δὲ φοβούμεθα μὴ ἀμφοτέρων ἅμα ἡμαρτήκαμεν ·
But as things are, we fear that we have failed at once in both expectations.


3.53.2
2093
τόν τε γὰρ ἀγῶνα περὶ τῶν δεινοτάτων εἶναι εἰκότως ὑποπτεύομεν καὶ ὑμᾶς μὴ οὐ κοινοὶ ἀποβῆτε , τεκμαιρόμενοι προκατηγορίας τε ἡμῶν οὐ προγεγενημένης ᾗ χρὴ ἀντειπεῖν ( ἀλλ’ αὐτοὶ λόγον ᾐτησάμεθα ) τό τε ἐπερώτημα βραχὺ ὄν , ᾧ τὰ μὲν ἀληθῆ ἀποκρίνασθαι ἐναντία γίγνεται , τὰ δὲ ψευδῆ ἔλεγχον ἔχει .
For with reason we suspect that our contest is for life or death, and that you will not prove impartial; inferring this from the fact of there having been made against us no previous charge for us to reply to, (but it was ourselves who requested permission to speak,) and from the question put to us being so concise; a true answer to which tells against us, while a false one is open to refutation.


3.53.3
2094
πανταχόθεν δὲ ἄποροι καθεστῶτες ἀναγκαζόμεθα καὶ ἀσφαλέστερον δοκεῖ εἶναι εἰπόντας τι κινδυνεύειν ·
Being involved, however, in perplexity on all sides, we are compelled, and it seems the safer course, to say something at all risks;


3.53.3
2095
καὶ γὰρ ὁ μὴ ῥηθεὶς λόγος τοῖς ὧδ’ ἔχουσιν αἰτίαν ἂν παράσχοι ὡς , εἰ ἐλέχθη , σωτήριος ἂν ἦν .
for the words that had been left unspoken might occasion to men in our situation the self-accusing thought, that if they had been spoken, they might have saved us.


3.53.4
2096
χαλεπῶς δὲ ἔχει ἡμῖν πρὸς τοῖς ἄλλοις καὶ ἡ πειθώ .
But in addition to our other disadvantages, the work of convincing you is also surrounded with difficulties.


3.53.4
2097
ἀγνῶτες μὲν γὰρ ὄντες ἀλλήλων ἐπεσενεγκάμενοι μαρτύρια ὧν ἄπειροι ἦτε ὠφελούμεθ’ ἄν ·
Were we unacquainted with each other, we might derive assistance from bringing forward fresh proofs of what you did not know:


3.53.4
2098
νῦν δὲ πρὸς εἰδότας πάντα λελέξεται , καὶ δέδιμεν οὐχὶ μὴ προκαταγνόντες ἡμῶν τὰς ἀρετὰς ἥσσους εἶναι τῶν ὑμετέρων ἔγκλημα αὐτὸ ποιῆτε , ἀλλὰ μὴ ἄλλοις χάριν φέροντες ἐπὶ διεγνωσμένην κρίσιν καθιστώμεθα .
but as it is, every thing will be said to men who know it already; and our fear is, not that you have before considered our services as inferior to your own, and now make that fact a ground of accusation against us; but that, through your determination to gratify another party, we are brought to a trial which is already decided against us.


3.54.1
2099
παρεχόμενοι δὲ ὅμως ἃ ἔχομεν δίκαια πρός τε τὰ Θηβαίων διάφορα καὶ ἐς ὑμᾶς καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους Ἕλληνας , τῶν εὖ δεδραμένων ὑπόμνησιν ποιησόμεθα καὶ πείθειν πειρασόμεθα .
" Nevertheless, while we urge what claims of justice we have, both against the Thebans, and with respect to you, and the rest of the Greeks, we will remind you of our good deeds, and endeavour to persuade you [to have mercy on us].


3.54.2
2100
&quot; φαμὲν γὰρ πρὸς τὸ ἐρώτημα τὸ βραχύ , εἴ τι Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τῷδε ἀγαθὸν πεποιήκαμεν , εἰ μὲν ὡς πολεμίους ἐρωτᾶτε , οὐκ ἀδικεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς μὴ εὖ παθόντας , φίλους δὲ νομίζοντας αὐτοὺς ἁμαρτάνειν μᾶλλον τοὺς ἡμῖν ἐπιστρατεύσαντας .
With regard then to your brief question, 'whether we have done any service to the Lacedaemonians and the allies in this war,' we say, that if you ask us as enemies, you are not wronged by us, though you should have received no good at our hands; and that if you consider us as friends, you are yourselves more in the wrong, for having marched against us.


3.54.3
2101
τὰ δ’ ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ καὶ πρὸς τὸν Μῆδον ἀγαθοὶ γεγενήμεθα , τὴν μὲν οὐ λύσαντες νῦν πρότεροι , τῷ δὲ ξυνεπιθέμενοι τότε ἐς ἐλευθερίαν τῆς Ἑλλάδος μόνοι Βοιωτῶν .
With respect, however, to what happened during the peace, and in opposition to the Mede, we proved ourselves good and true men; for we have not now been the first to break the peace, and we were then the only part of the Boeotians who joined in attacking the Mede for the liberty of Greece.


3.54.4
2102
καὶ γὰρ ἠπειρῶταί τε ὄντες ἐναυμαχήσαμεν ἐπ’ Ἀρτεμισίῳ , μάχῃ τε τῇ ἐν τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ γῇ γενομένῃ παρεγενόμεθα ὑμῖν τε καὶ Παυσανίᾳ ·
Even though we are an inland people, we were present in the sea-fight at Artemisium,


3.54.4
2103
εἴ τέ τι ἄλλο κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον ἐγένετο ἐπικίνδυνον τοῖς Ἕλλησι , πάντων παρὰ δύναμιν μετέσχομεν .
and in the battle fought in our territory we stood by you and Pausanias; and whatever other perilous achievement was performed by the Greeks, we took part in everything beyond our strength.


3.54.5
2104
καὶ ὑμῖν , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ἰδίᾳ , ὅτεπερ δὴ μέγιστος φόβος περιέστη τὴν Σπάρτην μετὰ τὸν σεισμὸν τῶν ἐς Ἰθώμην Εἱλώτων ἀποστάντων , τὸ τρίτον μέρος ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἐξεπέμψαμεν ἐς ἐπικουρίαν ·
And to you, Lacedaemonians, in particular, at the very time when, after the earthquake, the greatest alarm surrounded Sparta, because of the Helots who had established themselves in revolt at Ithome,


3.54.5
2105
ὧν οὐκ εἰκὸς ἀμνημονεῖν .
we sent the third part of our own people to your assistance: and you ought not to forget this.


3.55.1
2106
&quot; καὶ τὰ μὲν παλαιὰ καὶ μέγιστα τοιοῦτοι ἠξιώσαμεν εἶναι , πολέμιοι δὲ ἐγενόμεθα ὕστερον .
"With regard to events of early date, and of the greatest importance, such was the part we thought right to act; though afterwards we became your enemies.


3.55.1
2107
ὑμεῖς δὲ αἴτιοι ·
But it is you that are to blame for that;


3.55.1
2108
δεομένων γὰρ ξυμμαχίας ὅτε Θηβαῖοι ἡμᾶς ἐβιάσαντο , ὑμεῖς ἀπεώσασθε καὶ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ἐκελεύετε τραπέσθαι ὡς ἐγγὺς ὄντας , ὑμῶν δὲ μακρὰν ἀποικούντων .
for on our requesting an alliance with you, when the Thebans had used violence towards us, you rejected our suit, and told us to apply to the Athenians, since they were near to us, whereas you lived far away from us.


3.55.2
2109
ἐν μέντοι τῷ πολέμῳ οὐδὲν ἐκπρεπέστερον ὑπὸ ἡμῶν οὔτε ἐπάθετε οὔτε ἐμελλήσατε .
In the war, however, you neither suffered, nor would have suffered, any improper treatment from us.


3.55.3
2110
εἰ δ’ ἀποστῆναι Ἀθηναίων οὐκ ἠθελήσαμεν ὑμῶν κελευσάντων , οὐκ ἠδικοῦμεν ·
But if we would not revolt from the Athenians at your bidding, we did no wrong in that;


3.55.3
2111
καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι ἐβοήθουν ἡμῖν ἐναντία Θηβαίοις ὅτε ὑμεῖς ἀπωκνεῖτε , καὶ προδοῦναι αὐτοὺς οὐκέτι ἦν καλόν , ἄλλως τε καὶ οὓς εὖ παθών τις καὶ αὐτὸς δεόμενος προσηγάγετο ξυμμάχους καὶ πολιτείας μετέλαβεν , ἰέναι δὲ ἐς τὰ παραγγελλόμενα εἰκὸς ἦν προθύμως .
for it was they who assisted us against the Thebans, when you refused; and to give them up would not then have been honourable—especially as we had taken them for allies after receiving good from them, and at our own request, and had shared the rights of citizenship with them—but it was only reasonable that we should heartily obey their commands.


3.55.4
2112
ἃ δὲ ἑκάτεροι ἐξηγεῖσθε τοῖς ξυμμάχοις , οὐχ οἱ ἑπόμενοι αἴτιοι εἴ τι μὴ καλῶς ἐδρᾶτο , ἀλλ’ οἱ ἄγοντες ἐπὶ τὰ μὴ ὀρθῶς ἔχοντα .
And as to the measures in which either of you take the lead of your allies, it is not those who follow that are to blame, if you have ever done any thing wrong, but those who lead them on to what is not right.


3.56.1
2113
&quot; Θηβαῖοι δὲ πολλὰ μὲν καὶ ἄλλα ἡμᾶς ἠδίκησαν , τὸ δὲ τελευταῖον αὐτοὶ ξύνιστε , δι’ ὅπερ καὶ τάδε πάσχομεν .
"With respect to the Thebans, they had on many other occasions wronged us; and as for the last occasion, you know yourselves on what account we are in our present condition.


3.56.2
2114
πόλιν γὰρ αὐτοὺς τὴν ἡμετέραν καταλαμβάνοντας ἐν σπονδαῖς καὶ προσέτι ἱερομηνίᾳ ὀρθῶς τε ἐτιμωρησάμεθα κατὰ τὸν πᾶσι νόμον καθεστῶτα , τὸν ἐπιόντα πολέμιον ὅσιον εἶναι ἀμύνεσθαι , καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἂν εἰκότως δι’ αὐτοὺς βλαπτοίμεθα .
For as they were seizing our city in time of peace, and, moreover, at a holy time of the month, we did right in avenging ourselves on them, according to the principle recognised by all, that it is allowable to defend oneself against the attack of an enemy;


3.56.3
2115
εἰ γὰρ τῷ αὐτίκα χρησίμῳ ὑμῶν τε καὶ ἐκείνων πολεμίῳ τὸ δίκαιον λήψεσθε , τοῦ μὲν ὀρθοῦ φανεῖσθε οὐκ ἀληθεῖς κριταὶ ὄντες , τὸ δὲ ξυμφέρον μᾶλλον θεραπεύοντες .
and it would not now be fair that we should suffer on their account. For if you take your views of justice from your own immediate advantage and their animosity, you will show yourselves no true judges of what is right, but rather attentive to what is expedient.


3.56.4
2116
καίτοι εἰ νῦν ὑμῖν ὠφέλιμοι δοκοῦσιν εἶναι , πολὺ καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες μᾶλλον τότε ὅτε ἐν μείζονι κινδύνῳ ἦτε .
And yet if they appear to be serviceable to you now, much more did we and the rest of the Greeks then, when you were in greater danger.


3.56.4
2117
νῦν μὲν γὰρ ἑτέροις ὑμεῖς ἐπέρχεσθε δεινοί , ἐν ἐκείνῳ δὲ τῷ καιρῷ , ὅτε πᾶσι δουλείαν ἐπέφερεν ὁ βάρβαρος , οἵδε μετ’ αὐτοῦ ἦσαν .
For now you are yourselves attacking others, and the objects of their fear; but at that crisis, when the barbarian was bringing slavery on all, these Thebans were on his side.


3.56.5
2118
καὶ δίκαιον ἡμῶν τῆς νῦν ἁμαρτίας , εἰ ἄρα ἡμάρτηταί τι , ἀντιθεῖναι τὴν τότε προθυμίαν ·
And it is but just, that against our present misdeed—if we have really done amiss—you should set the zeal we showed then;


3.56.5
2119
καὶ μείζω τε πρὸς ἐλάσσω εὑρήσετε καὶ ἐν καιροῖς οἷς σπάνιον ἦν τῶν Ἑλλήνων τινὰ ἀρετὴν τῇ Ξέρξου δυνάμει ἀντιτάξασθαι , ἐπῃνοῦντό τε μᾶλλον οἱ μὴ τὰ ξύμφορα πρὸς τὴν ἔφοδον αὑτοῖς ἀσφαλείᾳ πράσσοντες , ἐθέλοντες δὲ τολμᾶν μετὰ κινδύνων τὰ βέλτιστα .
and you will find it greater than the fault to which it is opposed, and exhibited at those critical times when it was a rare thing for any of the Greeks to oppose his courage to the power of Xerxes; and therefore those were the more commended who did not in safety act for their own interest with regard to his invasion, but were willing to dare with dangers the better part.


3.56.6
2120
ὧν ἡμεῖς γενόμενοι καὶ τιμηθέντες ἐς τὰ πρῶτα νῦν ἐπὶ τοῖς αὐτοῖς δέδιμεν μὴ διαφθαρῶμεν , Ἀθηναίους ἑλόμενοι δικαίως μᾶλλον ἢ ὑμᾶς κερδαλέως .
But though  were of that number, and honoured by you in the highest degree, we are now afraid that we have been ruined by acting on the same principles, because we chose the side of the Athenians from regard to right, rather than yours from regard to interest.


3.56.7
2121
καίτοι χρὴ τ- αὐτὰ περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν ὁμοίως φαίνεσθαι γιγνώσκοντας , καὶ τὸ ξυμφέρον μὴ ἄλλο τι νομίσαι ἢ τῶν ξυμμάχων τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ὅταν αἰεὶ βέβαιον τὴν χάριν τῆς ἀρετῆς ἔχωσι καὶ τὸ παραυτίκα που ὑμῖν ὠφέλιμον καθιστῆται .
And yet men should consistently take the same view of the same case, and account expediency to be nothing else than this—when good allies receive everlasting gratitude for their services, while our own immediate interest in any case is secured.


3.57.1
2122
&quot; προσκέψασθέ τε ὅτι νῦν μὲν παράδειγμα τοῖς πολλοῖς τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἀνδραγαθίας νομίζεσθε ·
"Consider, too, that at present you are esteemed by the Greeks in general a pattern of honour and virtue:


3.57.1
2123
εἰ δὲ περὶ ἡμῶν γνώσεσθε μὴ τὰ εἰκότα ( οὐ γὰρ ἀφανῆ κρινεῖτε τὴν δίκην τήνδε , ἐπαινούμενοι δὲ περὶ οὐδ’ ἡμῶν μεμπτῶν ) , ὁρᾶτε ὅπως μὴ οὐκ ἀποδέξωνται ἀνδρῶν ἀγαθῶν πέρι αὐτοὺς ἀμείνους ὄντας ἀπρεπές τι ἐπιγνῶναι , οὐδὲ πρὸς ἱεροῖς τοῖς κοινοῖς σκῦλα ἀπὸ ἡμῶν τῶν εὐεργετῶν τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἀνατεθῆναι .
but if you pass an unjust sentence on us, (for this is no obscure cause that you will decide, but as men of high repute yourselves, you will pass sentence on us who are also not contemptible,) beware lest they may not approve of your coming to any improper decision respecting men of good character, though you are yourselves of still better; nor of spoils which were taken from us, the benefactors of Greece, being devoted in the national temples.


3.57.2
2124
δεινὸν δὲ δόξει εἶναι Πλάταιαν Λακεδαιμονίους πορθῆσαι , καὶ τοὺς μὲν πατέρας ἀναγράψαι ἐς τὸν τρίποδα τὸν ἐν Δελφοῖς δι’ ἀρετὴν τὴν πόλιν , ὑμᾶς δὲ καὶ ἐκ παντὸς τοῦ Ἑλληνικοῦ πανοικεσίᾳ διὰ Θηβαίους ἐξαλεῖψαι .
For it will seem a shocking thing that Lacedaemonians should have destroyed Plataea; and that your fathers should have inscribed the name of that city on the tripod at Delphi for its good services, whereas you utterly obliterated it from the whole Grecian name for the sake of Thebans. For to such a degree of misfortune have we been brought:


3.57.3
2125
ἐς τοῦτο γὰρ δὴ ξυμφορᾶς προκεχωρήκαμεν , οἵτινες Μήδων τε κρατησάντων ἀπωλλύμεθα καὶ νῦν ἐν ὑμῖν τοῖς πρὶν φιλτάτοις Θηβαίων ἡσσώμεθα καὶ δύο ἀγῶνας τοὺς μεγίστους ὑπέστημεν , τότε μέν , τὴν πόλιν εἰ μὴ παρέδομεν , λιμῷ διαφθαρῆναι , νῦν δὲ θανάτου δίκῃ κρίνεσθαι .
if the Medes had been victorious, we should have been ruined; and now we are supplanted by Thebans in your good opinion, who were before our best friends; and we have been subjected to two dangers, the greatest that can be imagined—then, to that of being starved to death, if we had not surrendered our city; and now, to that of being tried for our lives.


3.57.4
2126
καὶ περιεώσμεθα ἐκ πάντων Πλαταιῆς οἱ παρὰ δύναμιν πρόθυμοι ἐς τοὺς Ἕλληνας ἐρῆμοι καὶ ἀτιμώρητοι ·
And thus we Plataeans, who were zealous beyond our power in the cause of the Greeks, are rejected by all, deserted and unassisted;


3.57.4
2127
καὶ οὔτε τῶν τότε ξυμμάχων ὠφελεῖ οὐδείς , ὑμεῖς τε , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ἡ μόνη ἐλπίς , δέδιμεν μὴ οὐ βέβαιοι ἦτε .
for of those who were then our allies, no one helps us; and as for you, Lacedaemonians, our only hope, we fear that you are not to be depended upon.


3.58.1
2128
&quot; καίτοι ἀξιοῦμέν γε καὶ θεῶν ἕνεκα τῶν ξυμμαχικῶν ποτὲ γενομένων καὶ τῆς ἀρετῆς τῆς ἐς τοὺς Ἕλληνας καμφθῆναι ὑμᾶς καὶ μεταγνῶναι εἴ τι ὑπὸ Θηβαίων ἐπείσθητε , τήν τε δωρεὰν ἀνταπαιτῆσαι αὐτοὺς μὴ κτείνειν οὓς μὴ ὑμῖν πρέπει , σώφρονά τε ἀντὶ αἰσχρᾶς κομίσασθαι χάριν , καὶ μὴ ἡδονὴν δόντας ἄλλοις κακίαν αὐτοὺς ἀντιλαβεῖν ·
"And yet, for the sake of the gods who once presided over our confederacy, and of our valour in the cause of the Greeks, we call on you to relent and change your mind, if you have been persuaded to any thing by the Thebans; and to ask as a boon from them in return, that they would not kill those whose death is not honourable to you; and to receive an honest gratitude [from us], instead of a disgraceful one [from them];


3.58.2
2129
βραχὺ γὰρ τὸ τὰ ἡμέτερα σώματα διαφθεῖραι , ἐπίπονον δὲ τὴν δύσκλειαν αὐτοῦ ἀφανίσαι .
For it is an easy matter to take away our lives, but a difficult one to wipe out the disgrace of it;


3.58.2
2130
οὐκ ἐχθροὺς γὰρ ἡμᾶς εἰκότως τιμωρήσεσθε , ἀλλ’ εὔνους , κατ’ ἀνάγκην πολεμήσαντας .
and not, after giving pleasure to others, to incur infamy for it yourselves.


3.58.3
2131
ὥστε καὶ τῶν σωμάτων ἄδειαν ποιοῦντες ὅσια ἂν δικάζοιτε καὶ προνοοῦντες ὅτι ἑκόντας τε ἐλάβετε καὶ χεῖρας προϊσχομένους ( ὁ δὲ νόμος τοῖς Ἕλλησι μὴ κτείνειν τούτους ) , ἔτι δὲ καὶ εὐεργέτας γεγενημένους διὰ παντός .
since we are not enemies, that you should justly take vengeance on us, but men well disposed towards you, and who went to war with you only on compulsion. You would judge the case therefore rightly, if you both granted us personal security, and considered beforehand that you received us by our own consent, and while holding forth our hands to you—and the law of the Greeks is not to kill such—and, moreover, after our being all along your benefactors.


3.58.4
2132
ἀποβλέψατε γὰρ ἐς πατέρων τῶν ὑμετέρων θήκας , οὓς ἀποθανόντας ὑπὸ Μήδων καὶ ταφέντας ἐν τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ἐτιμῶμεν κατὰ ἔτος ἕκαστον δημοσίᾳ ἐσθήμασί τε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις νομίμοις , ὅσα τε ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν ἀνεδίδου ὡραῖα , πάντων ἀπαρχὰς ἐπιφέροντες , εὖνοι μὲν ἐκ φιλίας χώρας , ξύμμαχοι δὲ ὁμαίχμοις ποτὲ γενομένοις .
For look to the sepulchres of your fathers, whom, after being slain by the Medes, and buried in our country, we used to honour every year at the public expense with both garments and other things that are usual, and by offering first-fruits of all that our land produced in its season; as friends from a friendly country, and as allies to our former companions in arms.


3.58.4
2133
ὧν ὑμεῖς τ- ἐναντίον ἂν δράσαιτε μὴ ὀρθῶς γνόντες .
But you would do the contrary of this, should you decide unjustly.


3.58.5
2134
σκέψασθέ τε ·
Consider also this:


3.58.5
2135
Παυσανίας μὲν γὰρ ἔθαπτεν αὐτοὺς νομίζων ἐν γῇ τε φιλίᾳ τιθέναι καὶ παρ’ ἀνδράσι τοιούτοις ·
Pausanias buried them with a conviction that he was laying them in a friendly land, and amongst men of that character;


3.58.5
2136
ὑμεῖς δὲ εἰ κτενεῖτε ἡμᾶς καὶ χώραν τὴν Πλαταιίδα Θηβαΐδα ποιήσετε , τί ἄλλο ἢ ἐν πολεμίᾳ τε καὶ παρὰ τοῖς αὐθένταις πατέρας τοὺς ὑμετέρους καὶ ξυγγενεῖς ἀτίμους γερῶν ὧν νῦν ἴσχουσι καταλείψετε ;
but you, if you kill us, and make the Plataean territory a part of the Theban, what else will you do but leave your fathers and kinsmen in a hostile country, and amongst their murderers, unhonoured with the gifts which they now receive?


3.58.5
2137
πρὸς δὲ καὶ γῆν ἐν ᾗ ἠλευθερώθησαν οἱ Ἕλληνες δουλώσετε , ἱερά τε θεῶν οἷς εὐξάμενοι Μήδων ἐκράτησαν ἐρημοῦτε καὶ θυσίας τὰς πατρίους τῶν ἑσσαμένων καὶ κτισάντων ἀφαιρήσεσθε .
And further, you will condemn to slavery the land in which the Greeks won their freedom; will desolate the temples of the gods to whom they prayed, before conquering the Medes; and will take away our ancestral sacrifices from those who founded and instituted them.


3.59.1
2138
&quot; οὐ πρὸς τῆς ὑμετέρας δόξης , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , τάδε , οὔτε ἐς τὰ κοινὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων νόμιμα καὶ ἐς τοὺς προγόνους ἁμαρτάνειν οὔτε ἡμᾶς τοὺς εὐεργέτας ἀλλοτρίας ἕνεκα ἔχθρας μὴ αὐτοὺς ἀδικηθέντας διαφθεῖραι , φείσασθαι δὲ καὶ ἐπικλασθῆναι τῇ γνώμῃ οἴκτῳ σώφρονι λαβόντας , μὴ ὧν πεισόμεθα μόνον δεινότητα κατανοοῦντας , ἀλλ’ οἷοί τε ἂν ὄντες πάθοιμεν καὶ ὡς ἀστάθμητον τὸ τῆς ξυμφορᾶς ᾧτινί ποτ’ ἂν καὶ ἀναξίῳ ξυμπέσοι .
" This were not to your credit, Lacedaemonians, nor to offend against the general principles of the Greeks and your own forefathers, nor to destroy us, your benefactors, for other men's hatred of us, without having been wronged yourselves; but rather, to spare us, and relent in your hearts, having taken a rational pity on us; reflecting not only on the dreadful nature of the things we should suffer, but also on the character of the sufferers, and how misfortune admits not of calculating on whom it may one day fall, even without his deserving it."


3.59.2
2139
ἡμεῖς τε , ὡς πρέπον ἡμῖν καὶ ὡς ἡ χρεία προάγει , αἰτούμεθα ὑμᾶς , θεοὺς τοὺς ὁμοβωμίους καὶ κοινοὺς τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐπιβοώμενοι , πεῖσαι τάδε ·
We then, as is suitable for us, and as our need induces us to do, entreat you, with invocations to the gods who are worshipped at the same altar, and by all the Greeks in common, that we may prevail on you in these things;


3.59.2
2140
προφερόμενοι ὅρκους οὓς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ὤμοσαν μὴ ἀμνημονεῖν ἱκέται γιγνόμεθα ὑμῶν τῶν πατρῴων τάφων καὶ ἐπικαλούμεθα τοὺς κεκμηκότας μὴ γενέσθαι ὑπὸ Θηβαίοις μηδὲ τοῖς ἐχθίστοις φίλτατοι ὄντες παραδοθῆναι .
pleading the oaths which your fathers swore, we pray that you will not be unmindful of them: we beseech you by your fathers' tombs, and appeal for aid to the dead, that we may not come under the power of the Thebans, nor those who are dearest to them be given up to those who are most hateful.


3.59.2
2141
ἡμέρας τε ἀναμιμνῄσκομεν ἐκείνης ᾗ τὰ λαμπρότατα μετ’ αὐτῶν πράξαντες νῦν ἐν τῇδε τὰ δεινότατα κινδυνεύομεν παθεῖν .
We remind you, too, of that day on which we performed the most glorious things in their company, and yet now on this day are in danger of suffering the most dreadful.


3.59.3
2142
ὅπερ δὲ ἀναγκαῖόν τε καὶ χαλεπώτατον τοῖς ὧδε ἔχουσι , λόγου τελευτᾶν , διότι καὶ τοῦ βίου ὁ κίνδυνος ἐγγὺς μετ’ αὐτοῦ , παυόμενοι λέγομεν ἤδη ὅτι οὐ Θηβαίοις παρέδομεν τὴν πόλιν ( εἱλόμεθα γὰρ ἂν πρό γε τούτου τῷ αἰσχίστῳ ὀλέθρῳ λιμῷ τελευτῆσαι ) , ὑμῖν δὲ πιστεύσαντες προσήλθομεν ( καὶ δίκαιον , εἰ μὴ πείθομεν , ἐς τὰ αὐτὰ καταστήσαντας τὸν ξυντυχόντα κίνδυνον ἐᾶσαι ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς ἑλέσθαι ) , ἐπισκήπτομέν τε ἅμα μὴ Πλαταιῆς ὄντες οἱ προθυμότατοι περὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας γενόμενοι Θηβαίοις τοῖς ἡμῖν ἐχθίστοις ἐκ τῶν ὑμετέρων χειρῶν καὶ τῆς ὑμετέρας πίστεως ἱκέται ὄντες , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , παραδοθῆναι , γενέσθαι δὲ σωτῆρας ἡμῶν καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἄλλους Ἕλληνας ἐλευθεροῦντας ἡμᾶς διολέσαι &quot; .
" But, to bring our speech to a close—a thing which is necessary, and at the same time hard for men so circumstanced, because the peril of our life approaches with it—we now say, in conclusion, that we did not surrender our city to the Thebans, (for before that we would have preferred to die the most inglorious death—that of famine,) but confided in and capitulated to  And it were but fair, that, if we do not persuade you, you should restore us to the same position, and let us ourselves take the risk that befalls us."


3.60.1
2143
τοιαῦτα μὲν οἱ Πλαταιῆς εἶπον .
To this effect spoke the Plataeans.


3.60.1
2144
οἱ δὲ Θηβαῖοι δείσαντες πρὸς τὸν λόγον αὐτῶν μὴ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοί τι ἐνδῶσι , παρελθόντες ἔφασαν καὶ αὐτοὶ βούλεσθαι εἰπεῖν , ἐπειδὴ καὶ ἐκείνοις παρὰ γνώμην τὴν αὑτῶν μακρότερος λόγος ἐδόθη τῆς πρὸς τὸ ἐρώτημα ἀποκρίσεως .
The Thebans, fearing that the Lacedaemonians might somewhat relent in consequence of their words, came forward, and said that they also wished to address them, since, contrary to their expectation, the Plataeans had had a longer speech allowed them than a simple answer to the question.


3.60.1
2145
ὡς δ’ ἐκέλευσαν , ἔλεγον τοιάδε .
So when they had given them leave, they spoke as follows:


3.61.1
2146
&quot; τοὺς μὲν λόγους οὐκ ἂν ᾐτησάμεθα εἰπεῖν , εἰ καὶ αὐτοὶ βραχέως τὸ ἐρωτηθὲν ἀπεκρίναντο καὶ μὴ ἐπὶ ἡμᾶς τραπόμενοι κατηγορίαν ἐποιήσαντο καὶ περὶ αὑτῶν ἔξω τῶν προκειμένων καὶ ἅμα οὐδὲ ᾐτιαμένων πολλὴν τὴν ἀπολογίαν καὶ ἔπαινον ὧν οὐδεὶς ἐμέμψατο .
"We should not have asked permission to make this address, if the Plataeans, on their part, had briefly answered the question put to them, and had not turned upon us and delivered an invective; while at the same time they made a long defence of themselves, beyond the limits of the present question, and on points that had never been the grounds of any charge, together with a panegyric for things which no one found fault with.


3.61.1
2147
νῦν δὲ πρὸς μὲν τὰ ἀντειπεῖν δεῖ , τῶν δὲ ἔλεγχον ποιήσασθαι , ἵνα μήτε ἡ ἡμετέρα αὐτοὺς κακία ὠφελῇ μήτε ἡ τούτων δόξα , τὸ δ’ ἀληθὲς περὶ ἀμφοτέρων ἀκούσαντες κρίνητε .
But as it is, we must answer their accusations, and refute their self-praises; that neither our disgrace nor their reputation may assist them, but that you may hear the truth on both points, and so decide.


3.61.2
2148
&quot; ἡμεῖς δὲ αὐτοῖς διάφοροι ἐγενόμεθα πρῶτον ὅτι ἡμῶν κτισάντων Πλάταιαν ὕστερον τῆς ἄλλης Βοιωτίας καὶ ἄλλα χωρία μετ’ αὐτῆς , ἃ ξυμμείκτους ἀνθρώπους ἐξελάσαντες ἔσχομεν , οὐκ ἠξίουν οὗτοι , ὥσπερ ἐτάχθη τὸ πρῶτον , ἡγεμονεύεσθαι ὑφ’ ἡμῶν , ἔξω δὲ τῶν ἄλλων Βοιωτῶν παραβαίνοντες τὰ πάτρια , ἐπειδὴ προσηναγκάζοντο , προσεχώρησαν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους καὶ μετ’ αὐτῶν πολλὰ ἡμᾶς ἔβλαπτον , ἀνθ’ ὧν καὶ ἀντέπασχον .
We quarrelled then with them in the first instance, because, on our settling Plataea at a later period than the rest of Boeotia, and some other places with it, of which we took possession after driving out their mixed population, these men did not think fit, as had been first arranged, to submit to our supremacy, but, apart from the rest of the Boeotians, offended against the principles of their fathers, and when they were being compelled to observe them, went over to the Athenians, in conjunction with whom they did us many injuries, for which they also suffered in return.


3.62.1
2149
&quot; ἐπειδὴ δὲ καὶ ὁ βάρβαρος ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα , φασὶ μόνοι Βοιωτῶν οὐ μηδίσαι , καὶ τούτῳ μάλιστα αὐτοί τε ἀγάλλονται καὶ ἡμᾶς λοιδοροῦσιν .
"Again, when the barbarian came against Greece, they say that they were the only part of the Boeotians that did not Medize; and it is on this point that they most pride themselves, and abuse us.


3.62.2
2150
ἡμεῖς δὲ μηδίσαι μὲν αὐτοὺς οὔ φαμεν διότι οὐδ’ Ἀθηναίους , τῇ μέντοι αὐτῇ ἰδέᾳ ὕστερον ἰόντων Ἀθηναίων ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας μόνους αὖ Βοιωτῶν ἀττικίσαι .
But  say that they did not  because the Athenians did not either; but that in the same way, when the Athenians afterwards attacked the Greeks, they were the only people that


3.62.3
2151
καίτοι σκέψασθε ἐν οἵῳ εἴδει ἑκάτεροι ἡμῶν τοῦτο ἔπραξαν .
Yet look in what political condition we respectively did this.


3.62.3
2152
ἡμῖν μὲν γὰρ ἡ πόλις τότε ἐτύγχανεν οὔτε κατ’ ὀλιγαρχίαν ἰσόνομον πολιτεύουσα οὔτε κατὰ δημοκρατίαν ·
For our city happened at that time to be governed neither by an oligarchy with equal laws, nor by a democracy;


3.62.3
2153
ὅπερ δέ ἐστι νόμοις μὲν καὶ τῷ σωφρονεστάτῳ ἐναντιώτατον , ἐγγυτάτω δὲ τυράννου , δυναστεία ὀλίγων ἀνδρῶν εἶχε τὰ πράγματα .
but what is most opposed to laws and the best form of government, and comes nearest to [the rule of] a tyrant, a dominant party of a few individuals had the administration of affairs.


3.62.4
2154
καὶ οὗτοι ἰδίας δυνάμεις ἐλπίσαντες ἔτι μᾶλλον σχήσειν εἰ τὰ τοῦ Μήδου κρατήσειε , κατέχοντες ἰσχύι τὸ πλῆθος ἐπηγάγοντο αὐτόν ·
And so they, hoping to hold it still more surely if the cause of the Mede were triumphant, kept down the populace by force, and introduced him;


3.62.4
2155
καὶ ἡ ξύμπασα πόλις οὐκ αὐτοκράτωρ οὖσα ἑαυτῆς τοῦτ’ ἔπραξεν , οὐδ’ ἄξιον αὐτῇ ὀνειδίσαι ὧν μὴ μετὰ νόμων ἥμαρτεν .
and the whole city was not its own master when it so acted; nor is it right to reproach it for what it did amiss when not in the enjoyment of its laws.


3.62.5
2156
ἐπειδὴ γοῦν ὅ τε Μῆδος ἀπῆλθε καὶ τοὺς νόμους ἔλαβε , σκέψασθαι χρή , Ἀθηναίων ὕστερον ἐπιόντων τήν τε ἄλλην Ἑλλάδα καὶ τὴν ἡμετέραν χώραν πειρωμένων ὑφ’ αὑτοῖς ποιεῖσθαι καὶ κατὰ στάσιν ἤδη ἐχόντων αὐτῆς τὰ πολλά , εἰ μαχόμενοι ἐν Κορωνείᾳ καὶ νικήσαντες αὐτοὺς ἠλευθερώσαμεν τὴν Βοιωτίαν καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους νῦν προθύμως ξυνελευθεροῦμεν , ἵππους τε παρέχοντες καὶ παρασκευὴν ὅσην οὐκ ἄλλοι τῶν ξυμμάχων .
At any rate, after the Mede had retreated, and it had regained its laws, you ought to consider, that when the Athenians subsequently attacked the rest of Greece, and endeavoured to bring our country under their power, and by the aid of faction were already in possession of the greater part of it, we fought and conquered them at Coronea, and liberated Boeotia, and are now heartily joining in the liberation of the other states, by furnishing horses, and such a force as no other of the allies do. With regard, then, to our Medizing, such is the defence we make


3.63.1
2157
&quot; καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐς τὸν μηδισμὸν τοσαῦτα ἀπολογούμεθα ·
"But that it is [Plataeans,] who have both done more injury to Greece, and are more deserving of extreme punishment, we will now attempt to prove.


3.63.1
2158
ὡς δὲ ὑμεῖς μᾶλλόν τε ἠδικήκατε τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ ἀξιώτεροί ἐστε πάσης ζημίας , πειρασόμεθα ἀποφαίνειν .
It was for vengeance against us, you say, that you became allies and fellow-citizens of the Athenians.


3.63.2
2159
ἐγένεσθε ἐπὶ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ τιμωρίᾳ , ὡς φατέ , Ἀθηναίων ξύμμαχοι καὶ πολῖται .
Then you ought to have introduced them for aid against us alone, and not to have joined with them in attacking others;


3.63.2
2160
οὐκοῦν χρῆν τὰ πρὸς ἡμᾶς μόνον ὑμᾶς ἐπάγεσθαι αὐτοὺς καὶ μὴ ξυνεπιέναι μετ’ αὐτῶν ἄλλοις , ὑπάρχον γε ὑμῖν , εἴ τι καὶ ἄκοντες προσήγεσθε ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων , τῆς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τῶνδε ἤδη ἐπὶ τῷ Μήδῳ ξυμμαχίας γεγενημένης , ἣν αὐτοὶ μάλιστα προβάλλεσθε ·
such a course having certainly been open to you, in case of your being at all led on by the Athenians against your will, since the confederacy against the Mede had already been formed by these Lacedaemonians here, which you yourselves bring forward most prominently [in your own defence].


3.63.2
2161
ἱκανή γε ἦν ἡμᾶς τε ὑμῶν ἀποτρέπειν , καί , τὸ μέγιστον , ἀδεῶς παρέχειν βουλεύεσθαι .
Surely this was strong enough to divert us from attacking you, and, what is the greatest advantage, to enable you to take counsel in security.


3.63.2
2162
ἀλλ’ ἑκόντες καὶ οὐ βιαζόμενοι ἔτι εἵλεσθε μᾶλλον τὰ Ἀθηναίων .
But of your own accord, and not by compulsion, you still took the part of the Athenians by preference.


3.63.3
2163
καὶ λέγετε ὡς αἰσχρὸν ἦν προδοῦναι τοὺς εὐεργέτας ·
And you say that it had been base for you to betray your benefactors;


3.63.3
2164
πολὺ δέ γε αἴσχιον καὶ ἀδικώτερον τοὺς πάντας Ἕλληνας καταπροδοῦναι , οἷς ξυνωμόσατε , ἢ Ἀθηναίους μόνους , τοὺς μὲν καταδουλουμένους τὴν Ἑλλάδα , τοὺς δὲ ἐλευθεροῦντας .
but much more base and criminal was it so utterly to betray the whole body of the Greeks, with whom you confederated, than to give up the Athenians alone, who were enslaving Greece, while the others were its liberators.


3.63.4
2165
καὶ οὐκ ἴσην αὐτοῖς τὴν χάριν ἀνταπέδοτε οὐδὲ αἰσχύνης ἀπηλλαγμένην ·
And it was no equal return of favour that you made them, nor one free from disgrace.


3.63.4
2166
ὑμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ἀδικούμενοι αὐτούς , ὡς φατέ , ἐπηγάγεσθε , τοῖς δὲ ἀδικοῦσιν ἄλλους ξυνεργοὶ κατέστητε .
For you introduced them, as you say, when you were being injured; but you became co-operators with them in injuring others.


3.63.4
2167
καίτοι τὰς ὁμοίας χάριτας μὴ ἀντιδιδόναι αἰσχρὸν μᾶλλον ἢ τὰς μετὰ δικαιοσύνης μὲν ὀφειληθείσας , ἐς ἀδικίαν δὲ ἀποδιδομένας .
And yet not to return equal favours is more disgraceful than to fail in those which, though justly due, will be returned in furtherance of injustice.


3.64.1
2168
δῆλόν τε ἐποιήσατε οὐδὲ τότε τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἕνεκα μόνοι οὐ μηδίσαντες , ἀλλ’ ὅτι οὐδ’ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὑμεῖς δὲ τοῖς μὲν τ- αὐτὰ βουλόμενοι ποιεῖν , τοῖς δὲ τ- ἐναντία .
"You showed then plainly, that not even at that time was it for the sake of the Greeks that you alone did not Medize, but because the Athenians did not either, and because you wished to side with them, and against the rest.


3.64.2
2169
καὶ νῦν ἀξιοῦτε , ἀφ’ ὧν δι’ ἑτέρους ἐγένεσθε ἀγαθοί , ἀπὸ τούτων ὠφελεῖσθαι .
And now you claim to derive assistance from the circumstances in which you acted well through the influence of others.


3.64.2
2170
ἀλλ’ οὐκ εἰκός ·
That however is not reasonable;


3.64.2
2171
ὥσπερ δὲ Ἀθηναίους εἵλεσθε , τούτοις ξυναγωνίζεσθε , καὶ μὴ προφέρετε τὴν τότε γενομένην ξυνωμοσίαν ὡς χρὴ ἀπ’ αὐτῆς νῦν σῴζεσθαι .
but as you chose the Athenians, stand the brunt of the struggle with them, and do not bring forward the league that was then made, as though you ought to be spared from regard to that.


3.64.3
2172
ἀπελίπετε γὰρ αὐτὴν καὶ παραβάντες ξυγκατεδουλοῦσθε μᾶλλον Αἰγινήτας καὶ ἄλλους τινὰς τῶν ξυνομοσάντων ἢ διεκωλύετε , καὶ ταῦτα οὔτε ἄκοντες ἔχοντές τε τοὺς νόμους οὕσπερ μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο καὶ οὐδενὸς ὑμᾶς βιασαμένου ὥσπερ ἡμᾶς .
For you deserted it, and in violation of it joined in enslaving the Aeginetans, and some others who had entered into it, rather than prevented their being enslaved;


3.64.3
2173
τὴν τελευταίαν τε πρὶν περιτειχίζεσθαι πρόκλησιν ἐς ἡσυχίαν ἡμῶν , ὥστε μηδετέροις ἀμύνειν , οὐκ ἐδέχεσθε .
and that too not against your will, but while enjoying the same laws as you have to the present time, and without any one's compelling you, as they did us.


3.64.4
2174
τίνες ἂν οὖν ὑμῶν δικαιότερον πᾶσι τοῖς Ἕλλησι μισοῖντο , οἵτινες ἐπὶ τῷ ἐκείνων κακῷ ἀνδραγαθίαν προύθεσθε ;
Besides, the last proposal made to you before you were blockaded, that you should remain unmolested on condition of your aiding neither side, you did not accept.


3.64.4
2175
καὶ ἃ μέν ποτε χρηστοὶ ἐγένεσθε , ὡς φατέ , οὐ προσήκοντα νῦν ἐπεδείξατε , ἃ δὲ ἡ φύσις αἰεὶ ἐβούλετο , ἐξηλέγχθη ἐς τὸ ἀληθές ·
Who, then, could be more justly hated by the Greeks than you, who assumed an honourable bearing for their injury?


3.64.4
2176
μετὰ γὰρ Ἀθηναίων ἄδικον ὁδὸν ἰόντων ἐχωρήσατε .
And the goodness which you say you once exhibited, you have now shown to be not your proper character; but what your nature always wished, has been truly proved against you; for you accompanied the Athenians when they were walking in the path of injustice.


3.64.5
2177
&quot; τὰ μὲν οὖν ἐς τὸν ἡμέτερόν τε ἀκούσιον μηδισμὸν καὶ τὸν ὑμέτερον ἑκούσιον ἀττικισμὸν τοιαῦτα ἀποφαίνομεν ·
With regard then to our involuntary  and your voluntary  such are the proofs we have to offer.


3.65.1
2178
ἃ δὲ τελευταῖά φατε ἀδικηθῆναι , παρανόμως γὰρ ἐλθεῖν ἡμᾶς ἐν σπονδαῖς καὶ ἱερομηνίᾳ ἐπὶ τὴν ὑμετέραν πόλιν , οὐ νομίζομεν οὐδ’ ἐν τούτοις ὑμῶν μᾶλλον ἁμαρτεῖν .
"As for the last injuries which you say that you received, namely, that we came against your city in time of peace and at a holy time of the month, we are of opinion that neither in this point did we act more wrongly than you.


3.65.2
2179
εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἡμεῖς αὐτοὶ πρός τε τὴν πόλιν ἐλθόντες ἐμαχόμεθα καὶ τὴν γῆν ἐδῃοῦμεν ὡς πολέμιοι , ἀδικοῦμεν ·
If, indeed, we came against your city by our own design, and fought, and ravaged the land as enemies, we are guilty.


3.65.2
2180
εἰ δὲ ἄνδρες ὑμῶν οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ χρήμασι καὶ γένει , βουλόμενοι τῆς μὲν ἔξω ξυμμαχίας ὑμᾶς παῦσαι , ἐς δὲ τὰ κοινὰ τῶν πάντων Βοιωτῶν πάτρια καταστῆσαι , ἐπεκαλέσαντο ἑκόντες , τί ἀδικοῦμεν ;
But if men who were the first among you, both in property and family, wishing to stop you from your foreign connexion, and restore you to your hereditary principles common to all the Boeotians, voluntarily called us to their aid, how are we guilty?


3.65.2
2181
οἱ γὰρ ἄγοντες παρανομοῦσι μᾶλλον τῶν ἑπομένων .
For it is those who lead that are the transgressors, rather than those who follow.


3.65.3
2182
ἀλλ’ οὔτ’ ἐκεῖνοι , ὡς ἡμεῖς κρίνομεν , οὔτε ἡμεῖς ·
But neither did they do wrong, in our judgment, nor did we;


3.65.3
2183
πολῖται δὲ ὄντες ὥσπερ ὑμεῖς καὶ πλείω παραβαλλόμενοι , τὸ ἑαυτῶν τεῖχος ἀνοίξαντες καὶ ἐς τὴν αὑτῶν πόλιν φιλίως , οὐ πολεμίως κομίσαντες ἐβούλοντο τούς τε ὑμῶν χείρους μηκέτι μᾶλλον γενέσθαι τούς τε ἀμείνους τὰ ἄξια ἔχειν , σωφρονισταὶ ὄντες τῆς γνώμης καὶ τῶν σωμάτων τὴν πόλιν οὐκ ἀλλοτριοῦντες ἀλλ’ ἐς τὴν ξυγγένειαν οἰκειοῦντες , ἐχθροὺς οὐδενὶ καθιστάντες , ἅπασι δ’ ὁμοίως ἐνσπόνδους .
but being citizens, like yourselves, and having more at stake, by opening their walls to us and introducing us into their city in a friendly, not in a hostile, manner, they wished the bad among you no longer to become worse, and the good to have their deserts; being reformers of your principles, and not depriving the state of your persons, but restoring you to your kinsmen; making you foes to no one, but friends alike to all.


3.66.1
2184
τεκμήριον δὲ ὡς οὐ πολεμίως ἐπράσσομεν ·
"And we gave you a proof of our not having acted in a hostile manner;


3.66.1
2185
οὔτε γὰρ ἠδικήσαμεν οὐδένα , προείπομέν τε τὸν βουλόμενον κατὰ τὰ τῶν πάντων Βοιωτῶν πάτρια πολιτεύειν ἰέναι πρὸς ἡμᾶς .
for we injured no one, but made proclamation, that whoever wished to be governed according to the hereditary principles of all the Boeotians, should come over to us.


3.66.2
2186
καὶ ὑμεῖς ἄσμενοι χωρήσαντες καὶ ξύμβασιν ποιησάμενοι τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἡσυχάζετε , ὕστερον δὲ κατανοήσαντες ἡμᾶς ὀλίγους ὄντας , εἰ ἄρα καὶ ἐδοκοῦμέν τι ἀνεπιεικέστερον πρᾶξαι οὐ μετὰ τοῦ πλήθους ὑμῶν ἐσελθόντες , τὰ μὲν ὁμοῖα οὐκ ἀνταπέδοτε ἡμῖν , μήτε νεωτερίσαι ἔργῳ λόγοις τε πείθειν ὥστε ἐξελθεῖν , ἐπιθέμενοι δὲ παρὰ τὴν ξύμβασιν , οὓς μὲν ἐν χερσὶν ἀπεκτείνατε , οὐχ ὁμοίως ἀλγοῦμεν ( κατὰ νόμον γὰρ δή τινα ἔπασχον ) , οὓς δὲ χεῖρας προϊσχομένους καὶ ζωγρήσαντες ὑποσχόμενοί τε ἡμῖν ὕστερον μὴ κτενεῖν παρανόμως διεφθείρατε , πῶς οὐ δεινὰ εἴργασθε ;
And you gladly came, and made an agreement with us, and remained quiet at first; but afterwards, when you perceived that we were few in number, even supposing that we might be thought to have acted somewhat unfairly in entering your city without the consent of your populace, you did not requite us in the same manner—by not proceeding to extreme measures in action, but persuading us by words to retire—but you attacked us in violation of your agreement. And as for those whom you slew in battle, we do not grieve for them so much (for they suffered according to law—of a certain kind); but in the case of those whom you lawlessly butchered while holding forth their hands, and when you had given them quarter, and had subsequently promised us not to kill them, how can you deny that you acted atrociously?


3.66.3
2187
καὶ ταῦτα τρεῖς ἀδικίας ἐν ὀλίγῳ πράξαντες , τήν τε λυθεῖσαν ὁμολογίαν καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τὸν ὕστερον θάνατον καὶ τὴν περὶ αὐτῶν ἡμῖν μὴ κτενεῖν ψευσθεῖσαν ὑπόσχεσιν , ἢν τὰ ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς ὑμῖν μὴ ἀδικῶμεν , ὅμως φατὲ ἡμᾶς παρανομῆσαι καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀξιοῦτε μὴ ἀντιδοῦναι δίκην .
And now, after having perpetrated in a short time these three crimes—the breach of your agreement, the subsequent murder of the men, and the falsification of your promise not to kill them, in case we did no injury to your property in the country—you still assert that it is we who are the transgressors; and yourselves claim to escape paying the penalty for your crimes.


3.66.3
2188
οὔκ , ἤν γε οὗτοι τὰ ὀρθὰ γιγνώσκωσιν ·
No, not if these your judges come to a right decision;


3.66.3
2189
πάντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἕνεκα κολασθήσεσθε .
but for all of them shall you be punished.


3.67.1
2190
&quot; καὶ ταῦτα , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , τούτου ἕνεκα ἐπεξήλθομεν καὶ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν καὶ ἡμῶν , ἵνα ὑμεῖς μὲν εἰδῆτε δικαίως αὐτῶν καταγνωσόμενοι , ἡμεῖς δὲ ἔτι ὁσιώτερον τετιμωρημένοι .
" And now, Lacedaemonians, it is with this view that we have gone so far into these subjects—both with reference to you and to ourselves—that  may know that you will justly pass sentence on them, and  that we have still more righteously been avenged on them;"


3.67.2
2191
καὶ μὴ παλαιὰς ἀρετάς , εἴ τις ἄρα καὶ ἐγένετο , ἀκούοντες ἐπικλασθῆτε , ἃς χρὴ τοῖς μὲν ἀδικουμένοις ἐπικούρους εἶναι , τοῖς δὲ αἰσχρόν τι δρῶσι διπλασίας ζημίας , ὅτι οὐκ ἐκ προσηκόντων ἁμαρτάνουσιν .
" and that you may not relent on hearing of their virtues in times long gone by (if, indeed, they ever had any); for though these ought to be of service to the injured, to such as are doing any thing base they should be a reason for double punishment, because they do amiss in opposition to their proper character.


3.67.2
2192
μηδὲ ὀλοφυρμῷ καὶ οἴκτῳ ὠφελείσθων , πατέρων τε τάφους τῶν ὑμετέρων ἐπιβοώμενοι καὶ τὴν σφετέραν ἐρημίαν .
Nor let them derive benefit from their lamentations and pitiful wailing, while they appeal to the tombs of your fathers and their own destitution.


3.67.3
2193
καὶ γὰρ ἡμεῖς ἀνταποφαίνομεν πολλῷ δεινότερα παθοῦσαν τὴν ὑπὸ τούτων ἡλικίαν ἡμῶν διεφθαρμένην , ὧν πατέρες οἱ μὲν πρὸς ὑμᾶς τὴν Βοιωτίαν ἄγοντες ἀπέθανον ἐν Κορωνείᾳ , οἱ δὲ πρεσβῦται λελειμμένοι καὶ οἰκίαι ἐρῆμοι πολλῷ δικαιοτέραν ὑμῶν ἱκετείαν ποιοῦνται τούσδε τιμωρήσασθαι .
" For  show you, on the other hand, that our youth who were butchered by them received far more dreadful treatment; some of whose fathers fell at Coronea, in bringing Boeotia into connexion with you; while others, left lonely in their old age, and their houses desolate, prefer to you a far more just request for vengeance on these men."


3.67.4
2194
οἴκτου τε ἀξιώτεροι τυγχάνειν οἱ ἀπρεπές τι πάσχοντες τῶν ἀνθρώπων , οἱ δὲ δικαίως , ὥσπερ οἵδε , τὰ ἐναντία ἐπίχαρτοι εἶναι .
" And with regard to pity, it is those men who suffer undeservedly that better deserve to receive it; but those who suffer justly, as these do, deserve, on the contrary, to be rejoiced over."


3.67.5
2195
καὶ τὴν νῦν ἐρημίαν δι’ ἑαυτοὺς ἔχουσιν ·
Their present destitution, then, they have incurred by their own conduct;


3.67.5
2196
τοὺς γὰρ ἀμείνους ξυμμάχους ἑκόντες ἀπεώσαντο .
for they wilfully rejected the better alliance.


3.67.5
2197
παρενόμησάν τε οὐ προπαθόντες ὑφ’ ἡμῶν , μίσει δὲ πλέον ἢ δίκῃ κρίναντες καὶ οὐκ ἀνταποδόντες νῦν τὴν ἴσην τιμωρίαν ·
Nor did they thus outrage all law in consequence of having first suffered at our hands, but from deciding under the influence of hatred, rather than of justice.


3.67.5
2198
ἔννομα γὰρ πείσονται καὶ οὐχὶ ἐκ μάχης χεῖρας προϊσχόμενοι , ὥσπερ φασίν , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ ξυμβάσεως ἐς δίκην σφᾶς αὐτοὺς παραδόντες .
And they have not now given us proportionate satisfaction for their crimes; for they will suffer by a legal sentence, and not while holding forth their hands after battle, as they say, but after surrendering to you on definite terms to take their trial.


3.67.6
2199
ἀμύνατε οὖν , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , καὶ τῷ τῶν Ἑλλήνων νόμῳ ὑπὸ τῶνδε παραβαθέντι , καὶ ἡμῖν ἄνομα παθοῦσιν ἀνταπόδοτε χάριν δικαίαν ὧν πρόθυμοι γεγενήμεθα , καὶ μὴ τοῖς τῶνδε λόγοις περιωσθῶμεν ἐν ὑμῖν , ποιήσατε δὲ τοῖς Ἕλλησι παράδειγμα οὐ λόγων τοὺς ἀγῶνας προθήσοντες ἀλλ’ ἔργων , ὧν ἀγαθῶν μὲν ὄντων βραχεῖα ἡ ἀπαγγελία ἀρκεῖ , ἁμαρτανομένων δὲ λόγοι ἔπεσι κοσμηθέντες προκαλύμματα γίγνονται .
" Avenge therefore, Lacedaemonians, the law of the Greeks which has been violated by these men. And to us who have been treated in contempt of all law return a due gratitude for the zeal we have shown; and let us not lose our place in your favour through their words, but give the Greeks a proof that you will not institute contests of words, but of deeds; for which a short statement is sufficient when they are good; but when they are done amiss, harangues dressed out with imposing language serve as veils for them."


3.67.7
2200
ἀλλ’ ἢν οἱ ἡγεμόνες , ὥσπερ νῦν ὑμεῖς , κεφαλαιώσαντες πρὸς τοὺς ξύμπαντας διαγνώμας ποιήσησθε , ἧσσόν τις ἐπ’ ἀδίκοις ἔργοις λόγους καλοὺς ζητήσει &quot; .
" But if ruling states should, like you in the present instance, summarily pronounce their decisions on all offenders, men would be less disposed to seek for fine words as a screen for unjust actions."


3.68.1
2201
τοιαῦτα δὲ οἱ Θηβαῖοι εἶπον .
To this effect then spoke the Thebans.


3.68.1
2202
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι δικασταὶ νομίζοντες τὸ ἐπερώτημα σφίσιν ὀρθῶς ἕξειν , εἴ τι ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἀγαθὸν πεπόνθασι , διότι τόν τε ἄλλον χρόνον ἠξίουν δῆθεν αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὰς παλαιὰς Παυσανίου μετὰ τὸν Μῆδον σπονδὰς ἡσυχάζειν καὶ ὅτε ὕστερον ἃ πρὸ τοῦ περιτειχίζεσθαι προείχοντο αὐτοῖς , κοινοὺς εἶναι κατ’ ἐκεῖνα , ὡς οὐκ ἐδέξαντο , ἡγούμενοι τῇ ἑαυτῶν δικαίᾳ βουλήσει ἔκσπονδοι ἤδη ὑπ’ αὐτῶν κακῶς πεπονθέναι , αὖθις τὸ αὐτὸ ἕνα ἕκαστον παραγαγόντες καὶ ἐρωτῶντες , εἴ τι Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀγαθὸν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ δεδρακότες εἰσίν , ὁπότε μὴ φαῖεν , ἀπάγοντες ἀπέκτεινον καὶ ἐξαίρετον ἐποιήσαντο οὐδένα .
The Lacedaemonian judges, thinking that the question, " Whether they had received any service from them during the war,"  would be a fair one for them to put, because they had all along requested them, as they said, to remain quiet according to the original covenant of Pausanias, after the [retreat of the] Mede; and when afterwards they made to them the proposal which they did before they were besieged—to be neutral, according to the terms of that compact—in consequence of their not receiving it, they considered that on the strength of their own just wish they were now released from covenant with them, and had received evil at their hands. Accordingly, bringing each of them forward, and asking the same question, " Whether they had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war," when they said they had not, they led them away and killed them, not excepting one.


3.68.2
2203
διέφθειραν δὲ Πλαταιῶν μὲν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐλάσσους διακοσίων , Ἀθηναίων δὲ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν , οἳ ξυνεπολιορκοῦντο ·
Of the Plataeans themselves they slew not less than two hundred, and of the Athenians twenty-five, who were besieged with them;


3.68.2
2204
γυναῖκας δὲ ἠνδραπόδισαν .
the women they sold as slaves.


3.68.3
2205
τὴν δὲ πόλιν ἐνιαυτὸν μέν τινα Θηβαῖοι Μεγαρέων ἀνδράσι κατὰ στάσιν ἐκπεπτωκόσι καὶ ὅσοι τὰ σφέτερα φρονοῦντες Πλαταιῶν περιῆσαν ἔδοσαν ἐνοικεῖν ·
As for the city, the Thebans gave it for about a year to some of the Megareans to inhabit, who had been banished by party influence, and to such of the Plataeans on their own side as still survived.


3.68.3
2206
ὕστερον δὲ καθελόντες αὐτὴν ἐς ἔδαφος πᾶσαν ἐκ τῶν θεμελίων ᾠκοδόμησαν πρὸς τῷ Ἡραίῳ καταγώγιον διακοσίων ποδῶν πανταχῇ , κύκλῳ οἰκήματα ἔχον κάτωθεν καὶ ἄνωθεν , καὶ ὀροφαῖς καὶ θυρώμασι τοῖς τῶν Πλαταιῶν ἐχρήσαντο , καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἃ ἦν ἐν τῷ τείχει ἔπιπλα , χαλκὸς καὶ σίδηρος , κλίνας κατασκευάσαντες ἀνέθεσαν τῇ Ἥρᾳ , καὶ νεὼν ἑκατόμπεδον λίθινον ᾠκοδόμησαν αὐτῇ .
Afterwards they razed the whole of it to the ground, from the very foundations, and built to the sacred precinct of Juno an inn two hundred feet square, with rooms all round, above and below, making use of the roofs and doors of the Plataeans; and with the rest of the furniture, in brass and iron, that was within the wall, they made couches and dedicated them to Juno, building also in her honour a stone chapel of one hundred feet square.


3.68.3
2207
τὴν δὲ γῆν δημοσιώσαντες ἀπεμίσθωσαν ἐπὶ δέκα ἔτη , καὶ ἐνέμοντο Θηβαῖοι .
The land they confiscated, and let out for ten years, its occupiers being Thebans.


3.68.4
2208
σχεδὸν δέ τι καὶ τὸ ξύμπαν περὶ Πλαταιῶν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὕτως ἀποτετραμμένοι ἐγένοντο Θηβαίων ἕνεκα , νομίζοντες ἐς τὸν πόλεμον αὐτοὺς ἄρτι τότε καθιστάμενον ὠφελίμους εἶναι .
And nearly throughout the whole business it was on account of the Thebans that the Lacedaemonians were so averse to the Plataeans; for they considered them to be of service for the war which had then but recently broken out.


3.68.5
2209
καὶ τὰ μὲν κατὰ Πλάταιαν ἔτει τρίτῳ καὶ ἐνενηκοστῷ ἐπειδὴ Ἀθηναίων ξύμμαχοι ἐγένοντο οὕτως ἐτελεύτησεν .
Such then was the end of Plataea, in the ninety-third year after they became allies of the Athenians.


3.69.1
2210
αἱ δὲ τεσσαράκοντα νῆες τῶν Πελοποννησίων αἱ Λεσβίοις βοηθοὶ ἐλθοῦσαι , ὡς τότε φεύγουσαι διὰ τοῦ πελάγους ἔκ τε τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπιδιωχθεῖσαι καὶ πρὸς τῇ Κρήτῃ χειμασθεῖσαι καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῆς σποράδες πρὸς τὴν Πελοπόννησον κατηνέχθησαν , καταλαμβάνουσιν ἐν τῇ Κυλλήνῃ τρεῖς καὶ δέκα τριήρεις Λευκαδίων καὶ Ἀμπρακιωτῶν καὶ Βρασίδαν τὸν Τέλλιδος ξύμβουλον Ἀλκίδᾳ ἐπεληλυθότα .
Now the forty ships of the Peloponnesians which had gone to the relief of the Lesbians, (and which were flying, at the time we referred to them, across the open sea, and were pursued by the Athenians, and caught in a storm off Crete, and from that point had been dispersed,) on reaching the Peloponnese, found at Cyllene thirteen ships of the Leucadians and Ambraciots, with Brasidas son of Tellis, who had lately arrived as counsellor to Alcidas.


3.69.2
2211
ἐβούλοντο γὰρ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ὡς τῆς Λέσβου ἡμαρτήκεσαν , πλέον τὸ ναυτικὸν ποιήσαντες ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν πλεῦσαι στασιάζουσαν , δώδεκα μὲν ναυσὶ μόναις παρόντων Ἀθηναίων περὶ Ναύπακτον , πρὶν δὲ πλέον τι ἐπιβοηθῆσαι ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ναυτικόν , ὅπως προφθάσωσι , καὶ παρεσκευάζοντο ὅ τε Βρασίδας καὶ ὁ Ἀλκίδας πρὸς ταῦτα .
For the Lacedaemonians wished, as they had failed in saving Lesbos, to make their fleet more numerous, and to sail to Corcyra, which was in a state of sedition; as the Athenians were stationed at Naupactus with only twelve ships; and in order that they might have the start of them, before any larger fleet reinforced them from Athens. So Brasidas and Alcidas proceeded to make preparations for these measures.


3.70.1
2212
οἱ γὰρ Κερκυραῖοι ἐστασίαζον , ἐπειδὴ οἱ αἰχμάλωτοι ἦλθον αὐτοῖς οἱ ἐκ τῶν περὶ Ἐπίδαμνον ναυμαχιῶν ὑπὸ Κορινθίων ἀφεθέντες , τῷ μὲν λόγῳ ὀκτακοσίων ταλάντων τοῖς προξένοις διηγγυημένοι , ἔργῳ δὲ πεπεισμένοι Κορινθίοις Κέρκυραν προσποιῆσαι .
For the Corcyraeans began their sedition on the return home of the prisoners taken in the sea-fights off Epidamnus, who had been sent back by the Corinthians, nominally on the security of eight hundred talents given for them by their [proxeni] but in reality, because they had consented to bring over Corcyra to the Corinthians.


3.70.1
2213
καὶ ἔπρασσον οὗτοι , ἕκαστον τῶν πολιτῶν μετιόντες , ὅπως ἀποστήσωσιν Ἀθηναίων τὴν πόλιν .
These men then were intriguing, by visits to each of the citizens, to cause the revolt of the city from the Athenians.


3.70.2
2214
καὶ ἀφικομένης Ἀττικῆς τε νεὼς καὶ Κορινθίας πρέσβεις ἀγουσῶν καὶ ἐς λόγους καταστάντων ἐψηφίσαντο Κερκυραῖοι Ἀθηναίοις μὲν ξύμμαχοι εἶναι κατὰ τὰ ξυγκείμενα , Πελοποννησίοις δὲ φίλοι ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον .
On the arrival of a ship from Athens and another from Corinth, with envoys on board, and on their meeting for a conference, the Corcyraeans voted to continue allies of the Athenians according to their agreement, but to be on friendly terms with the Peloponnesians, as they had formerly been.


3.70.3
2215
καὶ ( ἦν γὰρ Πειθίας ἐθελοπρόξενός τε τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τοῦ δήμου προειστήκει ) ὑπάγουσιν αὐτὸν οὗτοι οἱ ἄνδρες ἐς δίκην , λέγοντες Ἀθηναίοις τὴν Κέρκυραν καταδουλοῦν .
Now there was one Pithias, a volunteer  of the Athenians, and the leader of the popular party;


3.70.4
2216
ὁ δὲ ἀποφυγὼν ἀνθυπάγει αὐτῶν τοὺς πλουσιωτάτους πέντε ἄνδρας , φάσκων τέμνειν χάρακας ἐκ τοῦ τε Διὸς τοῦ τεμένους καὶ τοῦ Ἀλκίνου ·
him these men brought to trial, on a charge of enslaving Corcyra to the Athenians.


3.70.4
2217
ζημία δὲ καθ’ ἑκάστην χάρακα ἐπέκειτο στατήρ .
Having been acquitted, he brought to trial in return the five richest individuals of their party, charging them with cutting stakes in the ground sacred to Jupiter and to [the hero] Alcinous;


3.70.5
2218
ὀφλόντων δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ πρὸς τὰ ἱερὰ ἱκετῶν καθεζομένων διὰ πλῆθος τῆς ζημίας , ὅπως ταξάμενοι ἀποδῶσιν , ὁ Πειθίας ( ἐτύγχανε γὰρ καὶ βουλῆς ὤν ) πείθει ὥστε τῷ νόμῳ χρήσασθαι .
the penalty affixed being a stater for every stake. When they had been convicted, and, owing to the amount of the penalty, were sitting as suppliants in the temples, that they might be allowed to pay it by instalments, Pithias, who was a member of the council also, persuades that body to enforce the law.


3.70.6
2219
οἱ δ’ ἐπειδὴ τῷ τε νόμῳ ἐξείργοντο καὶ ἅμα ἐπυνθάνοντο τὸν Πειθίαν , ἕως ἔτι βουλῆς ἐστί , μέλλειν τὸ πλῆθος ἀναπείσειν τοὺς αὐτοὺς Ἀθηναίοις φίλους τε καὶ ἐχθροὺς νομίζειν , ξυνίσταντό τε καὶ λαβόντες ἐγχειρίδια ἐξαπιναίως ἐς τὴν βουλὴν ἐσελθόντες τόν τε Πειθίαν κτείνουσι καὶ ἄλλους τῶν τε βουλευτῶν καὶ ἰδιωτῶν ἐς ἑξήκοντα ·
So when they were excluded from all hope by the severity of the law, and at the same time heard that Pithias was likely, while he was still in the council, to persuade the populace to hold as friends and foes the same as the Athenians did, they conspired together, and took daggers, and, having suddenly entered the council, assassinated Pithias and others, both counsellors and private persons, to the number of sixty.


3.70.6
2220
οἱ δέ τινες τῆς αὐτῆς γνώμης τῷ Πειθίᾳ ὀλίγοι ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν τριήρη κατέφυγον ἔτι παροῦσαν .
Some few, however, of the same party as Pithias, took refuge on board the Athenian trireme, which was still there.


3.71.1
2221
δράσαντες δὲ τοῦτο καὶ ξυγκαλέσαντες Κερκυραίους εἶπον ὅτι ταῦτα καὶ βέλτιστα εἴη καὶ ἥκιστ’ ἂν δουλωθεῖεν ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων , τό τε λοιπὸν μηδετέρους δέχεσθαι ἀλλ’ ἢ μιᾷ νηὶ ἡσυχάζοντας , τὸ δὲ πλέον πολέμιον ἡγεῖσθαι .
Having perpetrated this deed, and summoned the Corcyraeans to an assembly, they told them that this was the best thing for them, and that so they would be least in danger of being enslaved by the Athenians; and they moved, that in future they should receive neither party, except coming in a quiet manner with a single ship, but should consider a larger force as hostile.


3.71.1
2222
ὡς δὲ εἶπον , καὶ ἐπικυρῶσαι ἠνάγκασαν τὴν γνώμην .
As they moved, so also they compelled them to adopt their motion.


3.71.2
2223
πέμπουσι δὲ καὶ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας εὐθὺς πρέσβεις περί τε τῶν πεπραγμένων διδάξοντας ὡς ξυνέφερε καὶ τοὺς ἐκεῖ καταπεφευγότας πείσοντας μηδὲν ἀνεπιτήδειον πράσσειν , ὅπως μή τις ἐπιστροφὴ γένηται .
They likewise sent immediately ambassadors to Athens, to show, respecting what had been done, that it was for their best interests, and to prevail on the refugees there to adopt no measure prejudicial to them that there might not be any reaction.


3.72.1
2224
ἐλθόντων δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τούς τε πρέσβεις ὡς νεωτερίζοντας ξυλλαβόντες , καὶ ὅσους ἔπεισαν , κατέθεντο ἐς Αἴγιναν .
On their arrival, the Athenians arrested as revolutionists both the ambassadors and all who were persuaded by them, and lodged them in custody in Aegina.


3.72.2
2225
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ τῶν Κερκυραίων οἱ ἔχοντες τὰ πράγματα ἐλθούσης τριήρους Κορινθίας καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων πρέσβεων ἐπιτίθενται τῷ δήμῳ , καὶ μαχόμενοι ἐνίκησαν .
In the mean time, on the arrival of a Corinthian ship and some Lacedaemonian envoys, the dominant party of the Corcyraeans attacked the commonalty, and defeated them in battle.


3.72.3
2226
ἀφικομένης δὲ νυκτὸς ὁ μὲν δῆμος ἐς τὴν ἀκρόπολιν καὶ τὰ μετέωρα τῆς πόλεως καταφεύγει καὶ αὐτοῦ ξυλλεγεὶς ἱδρύθη , καὶ τὸν Ὑλλαϊκὸν λιμένα εἶχον ·
When night came on, the commons took refuge in the citadel, and on the eminences in the city, and there established themselves in a body, having possession also of the Hyllaic harbour;


3.72.3
2227
οἱ δὲ τήν τε ἀγορὰν κατέλαβον , οὗπερ οἱ πολλοὶ ᾤκουν αὐτῶν , καὶ τὸν λιμένα τὸν πρὸς αὐτῇ καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἤπειρον .
while the other party occupied the market-place, where most of them dwelt, with the harbour adjoining it, looking towards the mainland.


3.73.1
2228
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἠκροβολίσαντό τε ὀλίγα καὶ ἐς τοὺς ἀγροὺς περιέπεμπον ἀμφότεροι , τοὺς δούλους παρακαλοῦντές τε καὶ ἐλευθερίαν ὑπισχνούμενοι ·
The next day they had a few skirmishes, and both parties sent about into the country, inviting the slaves, and offering them freedom.


3.73.1
2229
καὶ τῷ μὲν δήμῳ τῶν οἰκετῶν τὸ πλῆθος παρεγένετο ξύμμαχον , τοῖς δ’ ἑτέροις ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου ἐπίκουροι ὀκτακόσιοι .
The greater part of them joined the commons as allies; while the other party was reinforced by eight hundred auxiliaries from the continent.


3.74.1
2230
διαλιπούσης δ’ ἡμέρας μάχη αὖθις γίγνεται καὶ νικᾷ ὁ δῆμος χωρίων τε ἰσχύι καὶ πλήθει προύχων ·
After the interval of a day, a battle was again fought, and the commons gained the victory, having the advantage both in strength of position and in numbers:


3.74.1
2231
αἵ τε γυναῖκες αὐτοῖς τολμηρῶς ξυνεπελάβοντο βάλλουσαι ἀπὸ τῶν οἰκιῶν τῷ κεράμῳ καὶ παρὰ φύσιν ὑπομένουσαι τὸν θόρυβον .
the women also boldly assisted them, throwing at the enemy with the filing from the houses, and standing the brunt of the mêlée beyond what could have been expected from their nature.


3.74.2
2232
γενομένης δὲ τῆς τροπῆς περὶ δείλην ὀψίαν , δείσαντες οἱ ὀλίγοι μὴ αὐτοβοεὶ ὁ δῆμος τοῦ τε νεωρίου κρατήσειεν ἐπελθὼν καὶ σφᾶς διαφθείρειεν , ἐμπιπρᾶσι τὰς οἰκίας τὰς ἐν κύκλῳ τῆς ἀγορᾶς καὶ τὰς ξυνοικίας , ὅπως μὴ ᾖ ἔφοδος , φειδόμενοι οὔτε οἰκείας οὔτε ἀλλοτρίας , ὥστε καὶ χρήματα πολλὰ ἐμπόρων κατεκαύθη καὶ ἡ πόλις ἐκινδύνευσε πᾶσα διαφθαρῆναι , εἰ ἄνεμος ἐπεγένετο τῇ φλογὶ ἐπίφορος ἐς αὐτήν .
About twllight the rout of the oligarchical party as effected; and fearing that the commons might carry the arsenal at the first assault, and put them to the sword, they fired the houses round about the market-place, and the lodging-houses, to stop their advance, sparing neither their own nor other people's; so that much property belonging to the merchants was consumed, and the whole city was in danger of being destroyed, if, in addition to the fire, there had been a wind blowing on it.


3.74.3
2233
καὶ οἱ μὲν παυσάμενοι τῆς μάχης ὡς ἑκάτεροι ἡσυχάσαντες τὴν νύκτα ἐν φυλακῇ ἦσαν ·
After ceasing from the engagement, both sides remained quiet, and kept guard during the night.


3.74.3
2234
καὶ ἡ Κορινθία ναῦς τοῦ δήμου κεκρατηκότος ὑπεξανήγετο , καὶ τῶν ἐπικούρων οἱ πολλοὶ ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον λαθόντες διεκομίσθησαν .
On victory declaring for the commons, the Corinthian ship stole out to sea; while the greater part of the auxiliaries passed over unobserved to the continent.


3.75.1
2235
τῇ δὲ ἐπιγιγνομένῃ ἡμέρᾳ Νικόστρατος ὁ Διειτρέφους Ἀθηναίων στρατηγὸς παραγίγνεται βοηθῶν ἐκ Ναυπάκτου δώδεκα ναυσὶ καὶ Μεσσηνίων πεντακοσίοις ὁπλίταις ·
The day following, Nicostratus son of Diitrephes, a general of the Athenians, came to their assistance from Naupactus with twelve ships and five hundred heavy-armed,


3.75.1
2236
ξύμβασίν τε ἔπρασσε καὶ πείθει ὥστε ξυγχωρῆσαι ἀλλήλοις δέκα μὲν ἄνδρας τοὺς αἰτιωτάτους κρῖναι , οἳ οὐκέτι ἔμειναν , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους οἰκεῖν σπονδὰς πρὸς ἀλλήλους ποιησαμένους καὶ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους , ὥστε τοὺς αὐτοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ φίλους νομίζειν .
and wished to negotiate a settlement, persuading them to agree with each other to bring to trial the ten chief authors of the sedition, (who immediately fled,) and for the rest to dwell in peace, having made an arrangement with each other, and with the Athenians, to have the same foes and friends.


3.75.2
2237
καὶ ὁ μὲν ταῦτα πράξας ἔμελλεν ἀποπλεύσεσθαι ·
After effecting this he was going to sail away;


3.75.2
2238
οἱ δὲ τοῦ δήμου προστάται πείθουσιν αὐτὸν πέντε μὲν ναῦς τῶν αὐτοῦ σφίσι καταλιπεῖν , ὅπως ἧσσόν τι ἐν κινήσει ὦσιν οἱ ἐναντίοι , ἴσας δὲ αὐτοὶ πληρώσαντες ἐκ σφῶν αὐτῶν ξυμπέμψειν .
but the leaders of the commons urged him to leave them five of his ships, that their adversaries might be less on the move; and they would themselves man and send with him an equal number of theirs.


3.75.3
2239
καὶ ὁ μὲν ξυνεχώρησεν , οἱ δὲ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς κατέλεγον ἐς τὰς ναῦς .
He consented to do so, and they proceeded to enlist their adversaries for the ships.


3.75.3
2240
δείσαντες δὲ ἐκεῖνοι μὴ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἀποπεμφθῶσι καθίζουσιν ἐς τὸ τῶν Διοσκόρων ἱερόν .
They, fearing that they should be sent off to Athens, seated themselves [as suppliants] in the temple of the Dioscuri;


3.75.4
2241
Νικόστρατος δὲ αὐτοὺς ἀνίστη τε καὶ παρεμυθεῖτο .
while Nicostratus was trying to persuade them to rise, and to encourage them.


3.75.4
2242
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἔπειθεν , ὁ δῆμος ὁπλισθεὶς ἐπὶ τῇ προφάσει ταύτῃ , ὡς οὐδὲν αὐτῶν ὑγιὲς διανοουμένων τῇ τοῦ μὴ ξυμπλεῖν ἀπιστίᾳ , τά τε ὅπλα αὐτῶν ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ἔλαβε καὶ αὐτῶν τινὰς οἷς ἐπέτυχον , εἰ μὴ Νικόστρατος ἐκώλυσε , διέφθειραν ἄν .
When he did not prevail on them, the commons, having armed themselves on this pretext, alleged that they had no good intentions, [as was evident] from their mistrust in not sailing with them; and removed their arms from their houses, and would have despatched some of them whom they met with, if Nicostratus had not prevented it.


3.75.5
2243
ὁρῶντες δὲ οἱ ἄλλοι τὰ γιγνόμενα καθίζουσιν ἐς τὸ Ἥραιον ἱκέται καὶ γίγνονται οὐκ ἐλάσσους τετρακοσίων .
The rest, seeing what was going on, seated themselves as suppliants in the temple of Juno, their number amounting to not less than four hundred.


3.75.5
2244
ὁ δὲ δῆμος δείσας μή τι νεωτερίσωσιν ἀνίστησί τε αὐτοὺς πείσας καὶ διακομίζει ἐς τὴν πρὸ τοῦ Ἡραίου νῆσον , καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἐκεῖσε αὐτοῖς διεπέμπετο .
But the commons, being afraid of their making some new attempt, persuaded them to rise, and transferred them to the island in front of the temple, and provisions were sent over there for them.


3.76.1
2245
τῆς δὲ στάσεως ἐν τούτῳ οὔσης τετάρτῃ ἢ πέμπτῃ ἡμέρᾳ μετὰ τὴν τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐς τὴν νῆσον διακομιδὴν αἱ ἐκ τῆς Κυλλήνης Πελοποννησίων νῆες , μετὰ τὸν ἐκ τῆς Ἰωνίας πλοῦν ἔφορμοι οὖσαι , παραγίγνονται τρεῖς καὶ πεντήκοντα ·
When the sedition was at this point, on the fourth or fifth day after the transfer of the men to the island, the ships of the Peloponnesians, three-and-fifty in number, came up from Cyllene, having been stationed there since their return from Ionia.


3.76.1
2246
ἦρχε δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀλκίδας , ὅσπερ καὶ πρότερον , καὶ Βρασίδας αὐτῷ ξύμβουλος ἐπέπλει .
The commander of them, as before, was Alcidas, Brasidas sailing with him as counsellor.


3.76.1
2247
ὁρμισάμενοι δὲ ἐς Σύβοτα λιμένα τῆς ἠπείρου ἅμα ἕῳ ἐπέπλεον τῇ Κερκύρᾳ .
After coming to anchor at Sybota, a port on the mainland, as soon as it was morning they sailed towards Corcyra.


3.77.1
2248
οἱ δὲ πολλῷ θορύβῳ καὶ πεφοβημένοι τά τ’ ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ τὸν ἐπίπλουν παρεσκευάζοντό τε ἅμα ἑξήκοντα ναῦς καὶ τὰς αἰεὶ πληρουμένας ἐξέπεμπον πρὸς τοὺς ἐναντίους , παραινούντων Ἀθηναίων σφᾶς τε ἐᾶσαι πρῶτον ἐκπλεῦσαι καὶ ὕστερον πάσαις ἅμα ἐκείνους ἐπιγενέσθαι .
The Corcyraeans, being in great confusion, and alarmed both at the state of things in the city and at the advance of the enemy, at once proceeded to equip sixty vessels, and to send them out, as they were successively manned, against the enemy; though the Athenians advised them to let  sail out first, and afterwards to follow themselves with all their ships together.


3.77.2
2249
ὡς δὲ αὐτοῖς πρὸς τοῖς πολεμίοις ἦσαν σποράδες αἱ νῆες , δύο μὲν εὐθὺς ηὐτομόλησαν , ἐν ἑτέραις δὲ ἀλλήλοις οἱ ἐμπλέοντες ἐμάχοντο , ἦν δὲ οὐδεὶς κόσμος τῶν ποιουμένων .
On their vessels coming up to the enemy in this scattered manner, two immediately went over to them, while in others the crews were fighting amongst themselves, and there was no order in their measures.


3.77.3
2250
ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι τὴν ταραχὴν εἴκοσι μὲν ναυσὶ πρὸς τοὺς Κερκυραίους ἐτάξαντο , ταῖς δὲ λοιπαῖς πρὸς τὰς δώδεκα ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὧν ἦσαν αἱ δύο Σαλαμινία καὶ Πάραλος .
The Peloponnesians, seeing their confusion, drew up twenty of their ships against the Corcyraeans, and the remainder against the twelve of the Athenians, amongst which were the two celebrated vessels, Salaminia and Paralus.


3.78.1
2251
καὶ οἱ μὲν Κερκυραῖοι κακῶς τε καὶ κατ’ ὀλίγας προσπίπτοντες ἐταλαιπώρουν τὸ καθ’ αὑτούς ·
The Corcyraeans, coming to the attack in bad order, and by few ships at a time, were distressed through their own arrangements;


3.78.1
2252
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι φοβούμενοι τὸ πλῆθος καὶ τὴν περικύκλωσιν ἁθρόαις μὲν οὐ προσέπιπτον οὐδὲ κατὰ μέσον ταῖς ἐφ’ ἑαυτοὺς τεταγμέναις , προσβαλόντες δὲ κατὰ κέρας καταδύουσι μίαν ναῦν .
while the Athenians, fearing the enemy's numbers and the chance of their surrounding them, did not attack their whole fleet, or even the centre of the division opposed to themselves, but took it in flank, and sunk one ship.


3.78.1
2253
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα κύκλον ταξαμένων αὐτῶν περιέπλεον καὶ ἐπειρῶντο θορυβεῖν .
After this, when the Peloponnesians had formed in a circle, they began to sail round them, and endeavoured to throw them into confusion.


3.78.2
2254
γνόντες δὲ οἱ πρὸς τοῖς Κερκυραίοις καὶ δείσαντες μὴ ὅπερ ἐν Ναυπάκτῳ γένοιτο , ἐπιβοηθοῦσι , καὶ γενόμεναι ἁθρόαι αἱ νῆες ἅμα τὸν ἐπίπλουν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐποιοῦντο .
The division which was opposed to the Corcyraeans perceiving this, and fearing that the same thing might happen as had at Naupactus, advanced to their support.


3.78.3
2255
οἱ δ’ ὑπεχώρουν ἤδη πρύμναν κρουόμενοι καὶ ἅμα τὰς τῶν Κερκυραίων ἐβούλοντο προκαταφυγεῖν ὅτι μάλιστα , ἑαυτῶν σχολῇ τε ὑποχωρούντων καὶ πρὸς σφᾶς τεταγμένων τῶν ἐναντίων .
Thus the whole united fleet simultaneously attacked the Athenians, who now began to retire, rowing astern; at the same time wishing the vessels of the Corcyraeans to retreat first, while they themselves drew off as leisurely as possible, and while the enemy were still ranged against them.


3.78.4
2256
ἡ μὲν οὖν ναυμαχία τοιαύτη γενομένη ἐτελεύτα ἐς ἡλίου δύσιν ,
The sea-fight then, having been of this character, ended at sun-set.


3.79.1
2257
καὶ οἱ Κερκυραῖοι δείσαντες μὴ σφίσιν ἐπιπλεύσαντες ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ὡς κρατοῦντες οἱ πολέμιοι ἢ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς νήσου ἀναλάβωσιν ἢ καὶ ἄλλο τι νεωτερίσωσι , τούς τε ἐκ τῆς νήσου πάλιν ἐς τὸ Ἥραιον διεκόμισαν καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐφύλασσον .
The Corcyraeans, fearing that the enemy, on the strength of his victory, might sail against the city, and either rescue the men in the island, or proceed to some other violent measures, carried the men over again to the sanctuary of Juno, and kept the city under guard.


3.79.2
2258
οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ μὲν τὴν πόλιν οὐκ ἐτόλμησαν πλεῦσαι κρατοῦντες τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ , τρεῖς δὲ καὶ δέκα ναῦς ἔχοντες τῶν Κερκυραίων ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον , ὅθενπερ ἀνηγάγοντο .
The Peloponnesians, however, though victorious in the engagement, did not dare to sail against the city, but withdrew with thirteen of the Corcyraean vessels to the continent, whence they had put out.


3.79.3
2259
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἐπὶ μὲν τὴν πόλιν οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἐπέπλεον , καίπερ ἐν πολλῇ ταραχῇ καὶ φόβῳ ὄντας καὶ Βρασίδου παραινοῦντος , ὡς λέγεται , Ἀλκίδᾳ , ἰσοψήφου δὲ οὐκ ὄντος ·
The next day they advanced none the more against the city, though the inhabitants were in great confusion, and though Brasidas, it is said, advised Alcidas to do so, but was not equal to him in authority;


3.79.3
2260
ἐπὶ δὲ τὴν Λευκίμμην τὸ ἀκρωτήριον ἀποβάντες ἐπόρθουν τοὺς ἀγρούς .
but they landed on the promontory of Leucimne, and ravaged the country.


3.80.1
2261
ὁ δὲ δῆμος τῶν Κερκυραίων ἐν τούτῳ περιδεὴς γενόμενος μὴ ἐπιπλεύσωσιν αἱ νῆες , τοῖς τε ἱκέταις ᾖσαν ἐς λόγους καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις , ὅπως σωθήσεται ἡ πόλις , καί τινας αὐτῶν ἔπεισαν ἐς τὰς ναῦς ἐσβῆναι ·
Meanwhile, the commons of the Corcyraeans, being very much alarmed lest the fleet should sail against them, entered into negotiation with the suppliants and the rest for the preservation of the city.


3.80.1
2262
ἐπλήρωσαν γὰρ ὅμως τριάκοντα προσδεχόμενοι τὸν ἐπίπλουν .
And some of them they persuaded to go on board the ships; for [notwithstanding the general dismay] they still manned thirty, in expectation of the enemy's advance against them.


3.80.2
2263
οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι μέχρι μέσου ἡμέρας δῃώσαντες τὴν γῆν ἀπέπλευσαν , καὶ ὑπὸ νύκτα αὐτοῖς ἐφρυκτωρήθησαν ἑξήκοντα νῆες Ἀθηναίων προσπλέουσαι ἀπὸ Λευκάδος ·
But the Peloponnesians, after ravaging the land till mid-day, sailed away:


3.80.2
2264
ἃς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι πυνθανόμενοι τὴν στάσιν καὶ τὰς μετ’ Ἀλκίδου ναῦς ἐπὶ Κέρκυραν μελλούσας πλεῖν ἀπέστειλαν καὶ Εὐρυμέδοντα τὸν Θουκλέους στρατηγόν .
and at night-fall the approach of sixty Athenian ships from Leucas was signaled to them, which the Athenians had sent with Eurymedon son of Thucles, as commander, on hearing of the sedition, and of the fleet about to go to Corcyra with Alcidas.


3.81.1
2265
οἱ μὲν οὖν Πελοποννήσιοι τῆς νυκτὸς εὐθὺς κατὰ τάχος ἐκομίζοντο ἐπ’ οἴκου παρὰ τὴν γῆν ·
The Peloponnesians then immediately proceeded homeward by night with all haste, passing along shore;


3.81.1
2266
καὶ ὑπερενεγκόντες τὸν Λευκαδίων ἰσθμὸν τὰς ναῦς , ὅπως μὴ περιπλέοντες ὀφθῶσιν , ἀποκομίζονται .
and having hauled their ships over the isthmus of Leucas, that they might not be seen doubling it, they sailed back.


3.81.2
2267
Κερκυραῖοι δὲ αἰσθόμενοι τάς τε Ἀττικὰς ναῦς προσπλεούσας τάς τε τῶν πολεμίων οἰχομένας , λαβόντες τούς τε Μεσσηνίους ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἤγαγον πρότερον ἔξω ὄντας , καὶ τὰς ναῦς περιπλεῦσαι κελεύσαντες ἃς ἐπλήρωσαν ἐς τὸν Ὑλλαϊκὸν λιμένα , ἐν ὅσῳ περιεκομίζοντο , τῶν ἐχθρῶν εἴ τινα λάβοιεν , ἀπέκτεινον ·
The Corcyraeans, on learning the approach of the Athenian fleet and the retreat of the enemy, took and brought into the city the Messenians, who before had been without the walls:


3.81.2
2268
καὶ ἐκ τῶν νεῶν ὅσους ἔπεισαν ἐσβῆναι ἐκβιβάζοντες ἀπεχρῶντο , ἐς τὸ Ἥραιόν τε ἐλθόντες τῶν ἱκετῶν ὡς πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας δίκην ὑποσχεῖν ἔπεισαν καὶ κατέγνωσαν πάντων θάνατον .
and having ordered the ships they had manned to sail round into the Hyllaic harbour, while they were going round, they put to death any of their opponents they might have happened to seize; and afterwards despatched, as they landed them from the ships, all that they had persuaded to go on board. They also went to the sanctuary of Juno, and persuaded about fifty men to take their trial, and condemned them all to death.


3.81.3
2269
οἱ δὲ πολλοὶ τῶν ἱκετῶν , ὅσοι οὐκ ἐπείσθησαν , ὡς ἑώρων τὰ γιγνόμενα , διέφθειρον αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ ἀλλήλους , καὶ ἐκ τῶν δένδρων τινὲς ἀπήγχοντο , οἱ δ’ ὡς ἕκαστοι ἐδύναντο ἀνηλοῦντο .
The majority of the suppliants, who had not been prevailed on by them, when they saw what was being done, slew one another there on the sacred ground; while some hanged themselves on the trees, and others destroyed themselves as they severally could.


3.81.4
2270
ἡμέρας τε ἑπτά , ἃς ἀφικόμενος ὁ Εὐρυμέδων ταῖς ἑξήκοντα ναυσὶ παρέμεινε , Κερκυραῖοι σφῶν αὐτῶν τοὺς ἐχθροὺς δοκοῦντας εἶναι ἐφόνευον , τὴν μὲν αἰτίαν ἐπιφέροντες τοῖς τὸν δῆμον καταλύουσιν , ἀπέθανον δέ τινες καὶ ἰδίας ἔχθρας ἕνεκα , καὶ ἄλλοι χρημάτων σφίσιν ὀφειλομένων ὑπὸ τῶν λαβόντων ·
During seven days that Eurymedon stayed after his arrival with his sixty ships, the Corcyraeans were butchering those of their countrymen whom they thought hostile to them; bringing their accusations, indeed, against those only who were for putting down the democracy; but some were slain for private enmity also, and others for money owed 'them by those who had borrowed it. Every mode of death was thus had recourse to;


3.81.5
2271
πᾶσά τε ἰδέα κατέστη θανάτου , καὶ οἷον φιλεῖ ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ γίγνεσθαι , οὐδὲν ὅτι οὐ ξυνέβη καὶ ἔτι περαιτέρω .
and whatever ordinarily happens in such a state of things, all happened then, and still more.


3.81.5
2272
καὶ γὰρ πατὴρ παῖδα ἀπέκτεινε καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερῶν ἀπεσπῶντο καὶ πρὸς αὐτοῖς ἐκτείνοντο , οἱ δέ τινες καὶ περιοικοδομηθέντες ἐν τοῦ Διονύσου τῷ ἱερῷ ἀπέθανον .
For father murdered son, and they were dragged out of the sanctuaries, or slain in them; while in that of Bacchus some were walled up and perished. So savagely did the sedition proceed; while it appeared to do so all the more from its being amongst the earliest.


3.82.1
2273
οὕτως ὠμὴ ἡ στάσις προυχώρησε , καὶ ἔδοξε μᾶλλον , διότι ἐν τοῖς πρώτη ἐγένετο , ἐπεὶ ὕστερόν γε καὶ πᾶν ὡς εἰπεῖν τὸ Ἑλληνικὸν ἐκινήθη , διαφορῶν οὐσῶν ἑκασταχοῦ τοῖς τε τῶν δήμων προστάταις τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐπάγεσθαι καὶ τοῖς ὀλίγοις τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους .
For afterwards, even the whole of Greece, so to say, was convulsed; struggles being everywhere made by the popular leaders to call in the Athenians, by the oligarchical party, the Lacedaemonians.


3.82.1
2274
καὶ ἐν μὲν εἰρήνῃ οὐκ ἂν ἐχόντων πρόφασιν οὐδ’ ἑτοίμων παρακαλεῖν αὐτούς , πολεμουμένων δὲ καὶ ξυμμαχίας ἅμα ἑκατέροις τῇ τῶν ἐναντίων κακώσει καὶ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ προσποιήσει ῥᾳδίως αἱ ἐπαγωγαὶ τοῖς νεωτερίζειν τι βουλομένοις ἐπορίζοντο .
Now they would have had no pretext for calling them in, nor have been prepared to do so, in time of peace. But when pressed by war, and when an alliance also was maintained by both parties for the injury of their opponents and for their own gain therefrom, occasions of inviting them were easily supplied to such as wished to effect any revolution.


3.82.2
2275
καὶ ἐπέπεσε πολλὰ καὶ χαλεπὰ κατὰ στάσιν ταῖς πόλεσι , γιγνόμενα μὲν καὶ αἰεὶ ἐσόμενα , ἕως ἂν ἡ αὐτὴ φύσις ἀνθρώπων ᾖ , μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ ἡσυχαίτερα καὶ τοῖς εἴδεσι διηλλαγμένα , ὡς ἂν ἕκασται αἱ μεταβολαὶ τῶν ξυντυχιῶν ἐφιστῶνται .
And many dreadful things befell the cities through this sedition, which occur, and will always do so, as long as human nature is the same, but in a more violent or milder form, and varying in their phenomena, as the several variations of circumstances may in each case present themselves.


3.82.2
2276
ἐν μὲν γὰρ εἰρήνῃ καὶ ἀγαθοῖς πράγμασιν αἵ τε πόλεις καὶ οἱ ἰδιῶται ἀμείνους τὰς γνώμας ἔχουσι διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐς ἀκουσίους ἀνάγκας πίπτειν ·
For in peace and prosperity both communities and individuals have better feelings, through not falling into urgent needs;


3.82.2
2277
ὁ δὲ πόλεμος ὑφελὼν τὴν εὐπορίαν τοῦ καθ’ ἡμέραν βίαιος διδάσκαλος καὶ πρὸς τὰ παρόντα τὰς ὀργὰς τῶν πολλῶν ὁμοιοῖ .
whereas war, by taking away the free supply of daily wants is a violent master, and assimilates most men's tempers to their present condition, The states then were thus torn by sedition, and the later instances of it in any part, from having heard what had been done before, exhibited largely an excessive refinement of ideas, both in the eminent cunning of their plans, and the monstrous cruelty of their vengeance.


3.82.3
2278
ἐστασίαζέ τε οὖν τὰ τῶν πόλεων , καὶ τὰ ἐφυστερίζοντά που πύστει τῶν προγενομένων πολὺ ἐπέφερε τὴν ὑπερβολὴν τοῦ καινοῦσθαι τὰς διανοίας τῶν τ’ ἐπιχειρήσεων περιτεχνήσει καὶ τῶν τιμωριῶν ἀτοπίᾳ .
The ordinary meaning of words was chanced by them as they thought proper. For reckless daring was regarded as courage tat was true to its friends; prudent delay, as specious cowardice; moderation, as a cloak for unmanliness; being intelligent in every thing, as being useful for nothing.


3.82.4
2279
καὶ τὴν εἰωθυῖαν ἀξίωσιν τῶν ὀνομάτων ἐς τὰ ἔργα ἀντήλλαξαν τῇ δικαιώσει .
Frantic violence was assigned to the manly character; cautious plotting was considered a specious excuse for declining the contest.


3.82.4
2280
τόλμα μὲν γὰρ ἀλόγιστος ἀνδρεία φιλέταιρος ἐνομίσθη , μέλλησις δὲ προμηθὴς δειλία εὐπρεπής , τὸ δὲ σῶφρον τοῦ ἀνάνδρου πρόσχημα , καὶ τὸ πρὸς ἅπαν ξυνετὸν ἐπὶ πᾶν ἀργόν ·
The advocate for cruel measures was always trusted; while his opponent was suspected.


3.82.4
2281
τὸ δ’ ἐμπλήκτως ὀξὺ ἀνδρὸς μοίρᾳ προσετέθη , ἀσφαλείᾳ δὲ τὸ ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι ἀποτροπῆς πρόφασις εὔλογος .
He that plotted against another, if successful, was reckoned clever; he that suspected a plot, still cleverer; but he that forecasted for escaping the necessity of all such things, was regarded as one who broke up his party, and was afraid of his adversaries.


3.82.5
2282
καὶ ὁ μὲν χαλεπαίνων πιστὸς αἰεί , ὁ δ’ ἀντιλέγων αὐτῷ ὕποπτος .
And the man who was violent was always trusted, and the one who opposed him was suspected.


3.82.5
2283
ἐπιβουλεύσας δέ τις τυχὼν ξυνετὸς καὶ ὑπονοήσας ἔτι δεινότερος ·
He who plotted and succeeded was considered wise, and he who anticipated plots was considered even wiser;


3.82.5
2284
προβουλεύσας δὲ ὅπως μηδὲν αὐτῶν δεήσει , τῆς τε ἑταιρίας διαλυτὴς καὶ τοὺς ἐναντίους ἐκπεπληγμένος .
but he who sought to avoid such things altogether was seen as a breaker of the party and a coward.


3.82.5
2285
ἁπλῶς δὲ ὁ φθάσας τὸν μέλλοντα κακόν τι δρᾶν ἐπῃνεῖτο , καὶ ὁ ἐπικελεύσας τὸν μὴ διανοούμενον .
In short, he who got in first to commit some evil deed was praised, and he who urged on others to do it was also praised.


3.82.6
2286
καὶ μὴν καὶ τὸ ξυγγενὲς τοῦ ἑταιρικοῦ ἀλλοτριώτερον ἐγένετο διὰ τὸ ἑτοιμότερον εἶναι ἀπροφασίστως τολμᾶν ·
And indeed, kinship became less close than party loyalty because the latter was more ready for unscrupulous daring.


3.82.6
2287
οὐ γὰρ μετὰ τῶν κειμένων νόμων ὠφελίας αἱ τοιαῦται ξύνοδοι , ἀλλὰ παρὰ τοὺς καθεστῶτας πλεονεξίᾳ .
For these associations were not formed with any benefit from the established laws, but out of a spirit of rapacity.


3.82.6
2288
καὶ τὰς ἐς σφᾶς αὐτοὺς πίστεις οὐ τῷ θείῳ νόμῳ μᾶλλον ἐκρατύνοντο ἢ τῷ κοινῇ τι παρανομῆσαι .
And their mutual trust was confirmed not by divine law, but by fellowship in lawlessness.


3.82.7
2289
τά τε ἀπὸ τῶν ἐναντίων καλῶς λεγόμενα ἐνεδέχοντο ἔργων φυλακῇ , εἰ προύχοιεν , καὶ οὐ γενναιότητι .
They accepted the fair speeches of their opponents with caution and looked at their actions.


3.82.7
2290
ἀντιτιμωρήσασθαί τέ τινα περὶ πλείονος ἦν ἢ αὐτὸν μὴ προπαθεῖν .
Taking vengeance on another was of greater consequence than avoiding injury oneself.


3.82.7
2291
καὶ ὅρκοι εἴ που ἄρα γένοιντο ξυναλλαγῆς , ἐν τῷ αὐτίκα πρὸς τὸ ἄπορον ἑκατέρῳ διδόμενοι ἴσχυον οὐκ ἐχόντων ἄλλοθεν δύναμιν ·
And if there were oaths exchanged to reconcile, they held only as long as they had no other resources.


3.82.7
2292
ἐν δὲ τῷ παρατυχόντι ὁ φθάσας θαρσῆσαι , εἰ ἴδοι ἄφαρκτον , ἥδιον διὰ τὴν πίστιν ἐτιμωρεῖτο ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ προφανοῦς , καὶ τό τε ἀσφαλὲς ἐλογίζετο καὶ ὅτι ἀπάτῃ περιγενόμενος ξυνέσεως ἀγώνισμα προσελάμβανεν .
But the first one to gain courage, if he saw his enemy off guard, took pleasure in revenge.


3.82.7
2293
ῥᾷον δ’ οἱ πολλοὶ κακοῦργοι ὄντες δεξιοὶ κέκληνται ἢ ἀμαθεῖς ἀγαθοί , καὶ τῷ μὲν αἰσχύνονται , ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ ἀγάλλονται .
And the majority of men, when dishonest, more easily get the name of talented, and when simple, that of good, and of the one they are ashamed, while of the other they are proud.


3.82.8
2294
πάντων δ’ αὐτῶν αἴτιον ἀρχὴ ἡ διὰ πλεονεξίαν καὶ φιλοτιμίαν ·
For the leaders in the cities, having a specious profession on each side, putting forward, respectively, the political equality of the people, or a moderate aristocracy,


3.82.8
2295
ἐκ δ’ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐς τὸ φιλονικεῖν καθισταμένων τὸ πρόθυμον .
while in word they served the common interests, in truth they made them their prizes.


3.82.8
2296
οἱ γὰρ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι προστάντες μετὰ ὀνόματος ἑκάτεροι εὐπρεποῦς , πλήθους τε ἰσονομίας πολιτικῆς καὶ ἀριστοκρατίας σώφρονος προτιμήσει , τὰ μὲν κοινὰ λόγῳ θεραπεύοντες ἆθλα ἐποιοῦντο , παντὶ δὲ τρόπῳ ἀγωνιζόμενοι ἀλλήλων περιγίγνεσθαι ἐτόλμησάν τε τὰ δεινότατα ἐπεξῇσάν τε τὰς τιμωρίας ἔτι μείζους , οὐ μέχρι τοῦ δικαίου καὶ τῇ πόλει ξυμφόρου προτιθέντες , ἐς δὲ τὸ ἑκατέροις που αἰεὶ ἡδονὴν ἔχον ὁρίζοντες , καὶ ἢ μετὰ ψήφου ἀδίκου καταγνώσεως ἢ χειρὶ κτώμενοι τὸ κρατεῖν ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν τὴν αὐτίκα φιλονικίαν ἐκπιμπλάναι .
And while struggling by every means to obtain an advantage over each other, they dared and carried out the most dreadful deeds; heaping on still greater vengeance, not only so far as was just and expedient for the state,


3.82.8
2297
ὥστε εὐσεβείᾳ μὲν οὐδέτεροι ἐνόμιζον , εὐπρεπείᾳ δὲ λόγου οἷς ξυμβαίη ἐπιφθόνως τι διαπράξασθαι , ἄμεινον ἤκουον .
but to the measure of what was pleasing to either party in each successive case: and whether by an unjust sentence of condemnation, or on gaining the ascendency by the strong hand, they were ready to glut the animosity they felt at the moment.


3.82.8
2298
τὰ δὲ μέσα τῶν πολιτῶν ὑπ’ ἀμφοτέρων ἢ ὅτι οὐ ξυνηγωνίζοντο ἢ φθόνῳ τοῦ περιεῖναι διεφθείροντο .
Thus piety was in fashion with neither party; but those who had the luck to effect some odious purpose under fair pretences were the more highly spoken of. The neutrals amongst the citizens were destroyed by both parties: either because they did not join them in their quarrel, or for envy that they should so escape.


3.83.1
2299
οὕτω πᾶσα ἰδέα κατέστη κακοτροπίας διὰ τὰς στάσεις τῷ Ἑλληνικῷ , καὶ τὸ εὔηθες , οὗ τὸ γενναῖον πλεῖστον μετέχει , καταγελασθὲν ἠφανίσθη , τὸ δὲ ἀντιτετάχθαι ἀλλήλοις τῇ γνώμῃ ἀπίστως ἐπὶ πολὺ διήνεγκεν ·
Thus every kind of villany arose in Greece from these seditions. Simplicity which is a very large ingredient in a noble nature, was laughed down and disappeared; and mutual opposition of feeling, with a want of confidence, prevailed to a great extent.


3.83.2
2300
οὐ γὰρ ἦν ὁ διαλύσων οὔτε λόγος ἐχυρὸς οὔτε ὅρκος φοβερός , κρείσσους δὲ ὄντες ἅπαντες λογισμῷ ἐς τὸ ἀνέλπιστον τοῦ βεβαίου μὴ παθεῖν μᾶλλον προυσκόπουν ἢ πιστεῦσαι ἐδύναντο .
For there was neither promise that could be depended on, nor oath that struck them with fear, t put an end to their strife; but all being in their calculations more strongly inclined to despair of any thing proving trustworthy, they looked forward to their own escape from suffering more easily than they could place confidence [in arrangements with others].


3.83.3
2301
καὶ οἱ φαυλότεροι γνώμην ὡς τὰ πλείω περιεγίγνοντο ·
And the men of more homely wit, generally speaking, had the advantage;


3.83.3
2302
τῷ γὰρ δεδιέναι τό τε αὑτῶν ἐνδεὲς καὶ τὸ τῶν ἐναντίων ξυνετόν , μὴ λόγοις τε ἥσσους ὦσι καὶ ἐκ τοῦ πολυτρόπου αὐτῶν τῆς γνώμης φθάσωσι προεπιβουλευόμενοι , τολμηρῶς πρὸς τὰ ἔργα ἐχώρουν .
for through fearing their own deficiency and the cleverness of their opponents, lest they might be worsted in words, and be first plotted against by means of the versatility of their enemy's genius, they proceeded boldly to deeds.


3.83.4
2303
οἱ δὲ καταφρονοῦντες κἂν προαισθέσθαι καὶ ἔργῳ οὐδὲν σφᾶς δεῖν λαμβάνειν ἃ γνώμῃ ἔξεστιν , ἄφαρκτοι μᾶλλον διεφθείροντο .
Whereas their opponents, arrogantly thinking that they should be aware beforehand, and that there was no need for their securing by action what they could by stratagem, were unguarded and more often ruined.


3.84.1
2304
ἐν δ’ οὖν τῇ Κερκύρᾳ τὰ πολλὰ αὐτῶν προυτολμήθη , καὶ ὁπόσα ὕβρει μὲν ἀρχόμενοι τὸ πλέον ἢ σωφροσύνῃ ὑπὸ τῶν τὴν τιμωρίαν παρασχόντων οἱ ἀνταμυνόμενοι δράσειαν , πενίας δὲ τῆς εἰωθυίας ἀπαλλαξείοντές τινες , μάλιστα δ’ ἂν διὰ πάθους , ἐπιθυμοῦντες τὰ τῶν πέλας ἔχειν , παρὰ δίκην γιγνώσκοιεν , οἵ τε μὴ ἐπὶ πλεονεξίᾳ , ἀπὸ ἴσου δὲ μάλιστα ἐπιόντες ἀπαιδευσίᾳ ὀργῆς πλεῖστον ἐκφερόμενοι ὠμῶς καὶ ἀπαραιτήτως ἐπέλθοιεν .
It was in Corcyra then that most of these things were first ventured on; both the deeds which men who were governed with a spirit of insolence, rather than of moderation, by those who afterwards afforded them an opportunity of vengeance, would do as the retaliating party; or which those who wished to rid themselves of their accustomed poverty, and passionately desired the possession of their neighbours' goods, might unjustly resolve on; or which those who had begin the struggle, not from covetousness, but on a more equal fooling, might savagely and ruthlessly proceed to, chiefly through being carried away by the rudeness of their anger.


3.84.2
2305
ξυνταραχθέντος τε τοῦ βίου ἐς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον τῇ πόλει καὶ τῶν νόμων κρατήσασα ἡ ἀνθρωπεία φύσις , εἰωθυῖα καὶ παρὰ τοὺς νόμους ἀδικεῖν , ἀσμένη ἐδήλωσεν ἀκρατὴς μὲν ὀργῆς οὖσα , κρείσσων δὲ τοῦ δικαίου , πολεμία δὲ τοῦ προύχοντος ·
Thus the course of life being at that time thrown into confusion in the city,


3.84.2
2306
οὐ γὰρ ἂν τοῦ τε ὁσίου τὸ τιμωρεῖσθαι προυτίθεσαν τοῦ τε μὴ ἀδικεῖν τὸ κερδαίνειν , ἐν ᾧ μὴ βλάπτουσαν ἰσχὺν εἶχε τὸ φθονεῖν .
human nature, which is wont to do wrong even in spite of the laws, having then got the mastery of the law, gladly showed itself to be unrestrained in passion, above reward for justice, and an enemy to all superiority.


3.84.3
2307
ἀξιοῦσί τε τοὺς κοινοὺς περὶ τῶν τοιούτων οἱ ἄνθρωποι νόμους , ἀφ’ ὧν ἅπασιν ἐλπὶς ὑπόκειται σφαλεῖσι κἂν αὐτοὺς διασῴζεσθαι , ἐν ἄλλων τιμωρίαις προκαταλύειν καὶ μὴ ὑπολείπεσθαι , εἴ ποτε ἄρα τις κινδυνεύσας τινὸς δεήσεται αὐτῶν .
And so men presume in their acts of vengeance to be the first to violate those common laws on such questions, from which all have a hope secured to them of being themselves rescued from misfortune; and they will not allow them to remain, in case of any one's ever being in danger and in need of some of them.


3.85.1
2308
οἱ μὲν οὖν κατὰ τὴν πόλιν Κερκυραῖοι τοιαύταις ὀργαῖς ταῖς πρώταις ἐς ἀλλήλους ἐχρήσαντο , καὶ ὁ Εὐρυμέδων καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀπέπλευσαν ταῖς ναυσίν ·
Such then were the passions which the Corcyraeans in the city indulged towards one another, being the first that did so. And Eurymedon and the Athenians sailed away with their ships;


3.85.2
2309
ὕστερον δὲ οἱ φεύγοντες τῶν Κερκυραίων ( διεσώθησαν γὰρ αὐτῶν ἐς πεντακοσίους ) τείχη τε λαβόντες , ἃ ἦν ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ , ἐκράτουν τῆς πέραν οἰκείας γῆς καὶ ἐξ αὐτῆς ὁρμώμενοι ἐλῄζοντο τοὺς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ καὶ πολλὰ ἔβλαπτον , καὶ λιμὸς ἰσχυρὸς ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ πόλει .
after which the Corcyraean exiles, (for five hundred of them had escaped,) having taken some forts that were on the mainland, were masters of their own territory on the opposite coast, and sallying forth from it, plundered those in the island, and did them much damage, a violent famine being produced in the city. They also sent embassies to Lacedaemon and Corinth about their restoration.


3.85.3
2310
ἐπρεσβεύοντο δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα καὶ Κόρινθον περὶ καθόδου ·
They would not else have preferred vengeance to region, and gain to innocence;


3.85.3
2311
καὶ ὡς οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς ἐπράσσετο , ὕστερον χρόνῳ πλοῖα καὶ ἐπικούρους παρασκευασάμενοι διέβησαν ἐς τὴν νῆσον ἑξακόσιοι μάλιστα οἱ πάντες , καὶ τὰ πλοῖα ἐμπρήσαντες , ὅπως ἀπόγνοια ᾖ τοῦ ἄλλο τι ἢ κρατεῖν τῆς γῆς , ἀναβάντες ἐς τὸ ὄρος τὴν Ἰστώνην , τεῖχος ἐνοικοδομησάμενοι ἔφθειρον τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ τῆς γῆς ἐκράτουν .
in which state envy would have had no power to hurt them.


3.86.1
2312
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους τελευτῶντος Ἀθηναῖοι εἴκοσι ναῦς ἔστειλαν ἐς Σικελίαν καὶ Λάχητα τὸν Μελανώπου στρατηγὸν αὐτῶν καὶ Χαροιάδην τὸν Εὐφιλήτου .
At the close of the same summer the Athenians despatched twenty ships to Sicily, with Laches son of Melanopus, and Charceades son of Euphiletus, in command of them.


3.86.2
2313
οἱ γὰρ Συρακόσιοι καὶ Λεοντῖνοι ἐς πόλεμον ἀλλήλοις καθέστασαν .
For the Syracusans and Leontines had gone to war with each other;


3.86.2
2314
ξύμμαχοι δὲ τοῖς μὲν Συρακοσίοις ἦσαν πλὴν Καμαριναίων αἱ ἄλλαι Δωρίδες πόλεις , αἵπερ καὶ πρὸς τὴν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τὸ πρῶτον ἀρχομένου τοῦ πολέμου ξυμμαχίαν ἐτάχθησαν , οὐ μέντοι ξυνεπολέμησάν γε , τοῖς δὲ Λεοντίνοις αἱ Χαλκιδικαὶ πόλεις καὶ Καμάρινα ·
the Syracusans having, with the exception of Camarina, all the Dorian cities in alliance with them—for indeed these had joined the Lacedaemonian confederacy at the commencement of the war, though they had not taken any part in it with them—while the Leontines had the Chalcidian cities, and Camarina.


3.86.2
2315
τῆς δὲ Ἰταλίας Λοκροὶ μὲν Συρακοσίων ἦσαν , Ῥηγῖνοι δὲ κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς Λεοντίνων .
In Italy the Locrians were on the side of the Syracusans; the Rhegians, on that of the Leontines, in consequence of their affinity to them.


3.86.3
2316
ἐς οὖν τὰς Ἀθήνας πέμψαντες οἱ τῶν Λεοντίνων ξύμμαχοι κατά τε παλαιὰν ξυμμαχίαν καὶ ὅτι Ἴωνες ἦσαν πείθουσι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους πέμψαι σφίσι ναῦς ·
So the allies of the Leontines sent to Athens, both on the ground of their former confederacy with them and because they were Ionians,


3.86.3
2317
ὑπὸ γὰρ τῶν Συρακοσίων τῆς τε γῆς εἴργοντο καὶ τῆς θαλάσσης .
and urged the Athenians to send them a fleet, for they were excluded by the Syracusans from the use both of land and sea.


3.86.4
2318
καὶ ἔπεμψαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τῆς μὲν οἰκειότητος προφάσει , βουλόμενοι δὲ μήτε σῖτον ἐς τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἄγεσθαι αὐτόθεν πρόπειράν τε ποιούμενοι εἰ σφίσι δυνατὰ εἴη τὰ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ πράγματα ὑποχείρια γενέσθαι .
Accordingly the Athenians sent it, on the pretence of their relationship, but really from a wish that no corn might be brought thence to the Peloponnese; and to make an experiment whether it were possible for them to bring Sicily into subjection to themselves.


3.86.5
2319
καταστάντες οὖν ἐς Ῥήγιον τῆς Ἰταλίας τὸν πόλεμον ἐποιοῦντο μετὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων .
Having established themselves therefore at Rhegium in Italy, they began the operations of the war in concert with their allies.


3.86.5
2320
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And so the summer ended.


3.87.1
2321
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος ἡ νόσος τὸ δεύτερον ἐπέπεσε τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , ἐκλιποῦσα μὲν οὐδένα χρόνον τὸ παντάπασιν , ἐγένετο δέ τις ὅμως διοκωχή .
The following winter the plague a second time attacked the Athenians, having indeed never entirely left them, though there had been some abatement of it.


3.87.2
2322
παρέμεινε δὲ τὸ μὲν ὕστερον οὐκ ἔλασσον ἐνιαυτοῦ , τὸ δὲ πρότερον καὶ δύο ἔτη , ὥστε Ἀθηναίους γε μὴ εἶναι ὅτι μᾶλλον τούτου ἐπίεσε καὶ ἐκάκωσε τὴν δύναμιν ·
It lasted the second time not less than a year—the former attack having lasted two—so that nothing reduced the power of the Athenians more than this.


3.87.3
2323
τετρακοσίων γὰρ ὁπλιτῶν καὶ τετρακισχιλίων οὐκ ἐλάσσους ἀπέθανον ἐκ τῶν τάξεων καὶ τριακοσίων ἱππέων , τοῦ δὲ ἄλλου ὄχλου ἀνεξεύρετος ἀριθμός .
For not less than four thousand four hundred heavy-armed in the ranks died of it, and three hundred of the equestrian order, with a number of the multitude that was never ascertained.


3.87.4
2324
ἐγένοντο δὲ καὶ οἱ πολλοὶ σεισμοὶ τότε τῆς γῆς , ἔν τε Ἀθήναις καὶ ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ καὶ ἐν Βοιωτοῖς καὶ μάλιστα ἐν Ὀρχομενῷ τῷ Βοιωτίῳ .
It was at that time also that the Numerous earthquakes happened at Athens, Euboea, and Boeotia, particularly at Orchomenos in the last-named country.


3.88.1
2325
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐν Σικελίᾳ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Ῥηγῖνοι τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος τριάκοντα ναυσὶ στρατεύουσιν ἐπὶ τὰς Αἰόλου νήσους καλουμένας ·
During the same winter the Athenians in Sicily and the Rhegians made an expedition with thirty ships against the islands of Aeolus;


3.88.1
2326
θέρους γὰρ δι’ ἀνυδρίαν ἀδύνατα ἦν ἐπιστρατεύειν .
for in summer it was impossible to invade them, owing to their want of water.


3.88.2
2327
νέμονται δὲ Λιπαραῖοι αὐτάς , Κνιδίων ἄποικοι ὄντες .
They are occupied by the Liparaean colony from Cnidos,


3.88.2
2328
οἰκοῦσι δ’ ἐν μιᾷ τῶν νήσων οὐ μεγάλῃ , καλεῖται δὲ Λιπάρα ·
who live in one of the which is of no great extent, called Lipara,


3.88.2
2329
τὰς δὲ ἄλλας ἐκ ταύτης ὁρμώμενοι γεωργοῦσι , Διδύμην καὶ Στρογγύλην καὶ Ἱεράν .
and proceed that to cultivate the rest, namely, Didyme, Strongyle, and Hiera.


3.88.3
2330
νομίζουσι δὲ οἱ ἐκείνῃ ἄνθρωποι ἐν τῇ Ἱερᾷ ὡς ὁ Ἥφαιστος χαλκεύει , ὅτι τὴν νύκτα φαίνεται πῦρ ἀναδιδοῦσα πολὺ καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν καπνόν .
Now the people in those parts think that in Hiera Vulcan works as a smith;


3.88.3
2331
κεῖνται δὲ αἱ νῆσοι αὗται κατὰ τὴν Σικελῶν καὶ Μεσσηνίων γῆν , ξύμμαχοι δ’ ἦσαν Συρακοσίων .
because it is seen to emit abundance of fire by night, and of smoke by day. These islands lie opposite the coasts of the Sicels and Messanians, and were in alliance with the Syracusans.


3.88.4
2332
τεμόντες δ’ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὴν γῆν , ὡς οὐ προσεχώρουν , ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς τὸ Ῥήγιον .
The Athenians ravaged their territory, and when they did not surrender, sailed back to Rhegium.


3.88.4
2333
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ πέμπτον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
And so the winter ended, and the fifth year of of which Thucydides wrote the history.


3.89.1
2334
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι μέχρι μὲν τοῦ Ἰσθμοῦ ἦλθον ὡς ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐσβαλοῦντες , Ἄγιδος τοῦ Ἀρχιδάμου ἡγουμένου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλέως , σεισμῶν δὲ γενομένων πολλῶν ἀπετράποντο πάλιν καὶ οὐκ ἐγένετο ἐσβολή .
The following summer the Peloponnesians and their allies proceeded as far as the Isthmus for the invasion of Attica, under the command of Agis son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians; but on the occurrence of numerous earthquakes, they turned back again, and no invasion was made.


3.89.2
2335
καὶ περὶ τούτους τοὺς χρόνους , τῶν σεισμῶν κατεχόντων , τῆς Εὐβοίας ἐν Ὀροβίαις ἡ θάλασσα ἐπανελθοῦσα ἀπὸ τῆς τότε οὔσης γῆς καὶ κυματωθεῖσα ἐπῆλθε τῆς πόλεως μέρος τι , καὶ τὸ μὲν κατέκλυσε ,τὸ δ’ ὑπενόστησε , καὶ θάλασσα νῦν ἐστὶ πρότερον οὖσα γῆ ·
About this period, when the earthquakes were so at, the sea at Orobiae in Euboea, having retired from as then the line of coast,


3.89.2
2336
καὶ ἀνθρώπους διέφθειρεν ὅσοι μὴ ἐδύναντο φθῆναι πρὸς τὰ μετέωρα ἀναδραμόντες .
and afterwards returned with swell, invaded a portion of the city, and partly init, though it also partly subsided; and so that is now sea was before land.


3.89.3
2337
καὶ περὶ Ἀταλάντην τὴν ἐπὶ Λοκροῖς τοῖς Ὀπουντίοις νῆσον παραπλησία γίγνεται ἐπίκλυσις , καὶ τοῦ τε φρουρίου τῶν Ἀθηναίων παρεῖλε καὶ δύο νεῶν ἀνειλκυσμένων τὴν ἑτέραν κατέαξεν .
It also destroyed the inhabitants, excepting such as could run up first to the higher parts of the There was a similar inundation too at Atalanta, the island off the Opuntian Locri, which carried away a part of built by the Athenians, and wrecked one of two ships re drawn up on the beach.


3.89.4
2338
ἐγένετο δὲ καὶ ἐν Πεπαρήθῳ κύματος ἐπαναχώρησίς τις , οὐ μέντοι ἐπέκλυσέ γε ·
At Peparethus too there treat of the sea, though no inundation followed;


3.89.4
2339
καὶ σεισμὸς τοῦ τείχους τι κατέβαλε καὶ τὸ πρυτανεῖον καὶ ἄλλας οἰκίας ὀλίγας .
and an earthquake threw down a part of the wall, with the townhall few houses besides.


3.89.5
2340
αἴτιον δ’ ἔγωγε νομίζω τοῦ τοιούτου , ᾗ ἰσχυρότατος ὁ σεισμὸς ἐγένετο , κατὰ τοῦτο ἀποστέλλειν τε τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἐξαπίνης πάλιν ἐπισπωμένην βιαιότερον τὴν ἐπίκλυσιν ποιεῖν ·
The cause of this, in my own opinion, is, that where the shock of the earthquake has been most violent, there it drives the sea back,


3.89.5
2341
ἄνευ δὲ σεισμοῦ οὐκ ἄν μοι δοκεῖ τὸ τοιοῦτο ξυμβῆναι γενέσθαι .
and this suddenly coming on again with a violent rush causes the inundation. But without an earthquake I do not think that such an occurrence would ever happen.


3.90.1
2342
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους ἐπολέμουν μὲν καὶ ἄλλοι , ὡς ἑκάστοις ξυνέβαινεν , ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ καὶ αὐτοὶ οἱ Σικελιῶται ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους στρατεύοντες καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ξὺν τοῖς σφετέροις ξυμμάχοις ·
During the same summer different parties, as they might severally happen, made war in Sicily; both the Siceliots themselves against each other, and the Athenians in concert with their allies;


3.90.1
2343
ἃ δὲ λόγου μάλιστα ἄξια ἢ μετὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἔπραξαν ἢ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οἱ ἀντιπόλεμοι , τούτων μνησθήσομαι .
but I shall [only] mention the most memorable actions achieved by the Athenians and their allies, or against the Athenians by the enemy.


3.90.2
2344
Χαροιάδου γὰρ ἤδη τοῦ Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοῦ τεθνηκότος ὑπὸ Συρακοσίων πολέμῳ Λάχης ἅπασαν ἔχων τῶν νεῶν τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐστράτευσε μετὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐπὶ Μυλὰς τὰς Μεσσηνίων .
Charaeades then, the Athenian commander, having already been killed in war by the Syracusans,


3.90.2
2345
ἔτυχον δὲ δύο φυλαὶ ἐν ταῖς Μυλαῖς τῶν Μεσσηνίων φρουροῦσαι καί τινα καὶ ἐνέδραν πεποιημέναι τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν .
Laches, who was now in sole command of the fleet, turned his arms, in concert with his allies, against Myle, a town belonging to the Messanians. Now there were two divisions of the Messanians in garrison at Mylae, and they had laid an ambush for the party coming from their ships.


3.90.3
2346
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι τούς τε ἐκ τῆς ἐνέδρας τρέπουσι καὶ διαφθείρουσι πολλούς , καὶ τῷ ἐρύματι προσβαλόντες ἠνάγκασαν ὁμολογίᾳ τήν τε ἀκρόπολιν παραδοῦναι καὶ ἐπὶ Μεσσήνην ξυστρατεῦσαι .
But the Athenians and their allies routed the troops in ambush, and slew many of them, and having assaulted the fortifications, compelled them to surrender the citadel, and to march with them against Messana.


3.90.4
2347
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἐπελθόντων οἱ Μεσσήνιοι τῶν τε Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων προσεχώρησαν καὶ αὐτοί , ὁμήρους τε δόντες καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πιστὰ παρασχόμενοι .
Afterwards, on the attack of the Athenians and their allies, the Messanians too capitulated, giving hostages and all other securities.


3.91.1
2348
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τριάκοντα μὲν ναῦς ἔστειλαν περὶ Πελοπόννησον , ὧν ἐστρατήγει Δημοσθένης τε ὁ Ἀλκισθένους καὶ Προκλῆς ὁ Θεοδώρου , ἐξήκοντα δὲ ἐς Μῆλον καὶ δισχιλίους ὁπλίτας ·
The same summer the Athenians despatched thirty ships to cruise about the Peloponnese, under the command of Demosthenes son of Alcisthenes, and Procles son of Theodorus,


3.91.1
2349
ἐστρατήγει δὲ αὐτῶν Νικίας ὁ Νικηράτου .
and sixty ships and two thousand heavy-armed against Melos, under the command of Nicias son of Niceratus.


3.91.2
2350
τοὺς γὰρ Μηλίους ὄντας νησιώτας καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλοντας ὑπακούειν οὐδὲ ἐς τὸ αὑτῶν ξυμμαχικὸν ἰέναι ἐβούλοντο προσαγαγέσθαι .
For as the Melians were islanders, and yet would not submit to them nor join their confederacy, they wished to reduce them.


3.91.3
2351
ὡς δὲ αὐτοῖς δῃουμένης τῆς γῆς οὐ προσεχώρουν , ἄραντες ἐκ τῆς Μήλου αὐτοὶ μὲν ἔπλευσαν ἐς Ὠρωπὸν τῆς Γραϊκῆς , ὑπὸ νύκτα δὲ σχόντες εὐθὺς ἐπορεύοντο οἱ ὁπλῖται ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν πεζῇ ἐς Τάναγραν τῆς Βοιωτίας .
When, however, they did not surrender to them on the wasting of their territory, they sailed to Oropus, on the coast opposite Attica; and having landed at night, the heavy-armed immediately marched from their ships to Tanagra in Boeotia;


3.91.4
2352
οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως πανδημεὶ Ἀθηναῖοι , Ἱππονίκου τε τοῦ Καλλίου στρατηγοῦντος καὶ Εὐρυμέδοντος τοῦ Θουκλέους , ἀπὸ σημείου ἐς τὸ αὐτὸ κατὰ γῆν ἀπήντων .
while the Athenians in the city, on a given signal, met them at the same place by land in full force, under the command of Hipponicus son of Callias, and Eurymedon son of Thucles.


3.91.5
2353
καὶ στρατοπεδευσάμενοι ταύτην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐν τῇ Τανάγρᾳ ἐδῄουν καὶ ἐνηυλίσαντο .
Having pitched their camp for that day in the territory of Tanagra, they laid it waste, and passed the night there.


3.91.5
2354
καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ μάχῃ κρατήσαντες τοὺς ἐπεξελθόντας τῶν Ταναγραίων καὶ Θηβαίων τινὰς προσβεβοηθηκότας καὶ ὅπλα λαβόντες καὶ τροπαῖον στήσαντες ἀνεχώρησαν , οἱ μὲν ἐς τὴν πόλιν , οἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς .
The next day, after defeating in battle those of the Tanagraeans and the Thebans who had come out against them, and after taking some arms, and erecting a trophy, they returned, one party to the city, the other to their fleet.


3.91.6
2355
καὶ παραπλεύσας ὁ Νικίας ταῖς ἑξήκοντα ναυσὶ τῆς Λοκρίδος τὰ ἐπιθαλάσσια ἔτεμε καὶ ἀνεχώρησεν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
And Nicias, with his sixty ships, coasted along and ravaged the maritime parts of Locris, and then returned home.


3.92.1
2356
ὑπὸ δὲ τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον Λακεδαιμόνιοι Ἡράκλειαν τὴν ἐν Τραχινίᾳ ἀποικίαν καθίσταντο ἀπὸ τοιᾶσδε γνώμης .
About this time the Lacedaemonians prepared to found their colony of Heraclea, in Trachiniae, with the following purpose.


3.92.2
2357
Μηλιῆς οἱ ξύμπαντες εἰσὶ μὲν τρία μέρη , Παράλιοι Ἰριῆς Τραχίνιοι ·
The Melians form, in all, three tribes, the Paralians, Hiereans, and Trachinians.


3.92.2
2358
τούτων δὲ οἱ Τραχίνιοι πολέμῳ ἐφθαρμένοι ὑπὸ Οἰταίων ὁμόρων ὄντων , τὸ πρῶτον μελλήσαντες Ἀθηναίοις προσθεῖναι σφᾶς αὐτούς , δείσαντες δὲ μὴ οὐ σφίσι πιστοὶ ὦσι , πέμπουσιν ἐς Λακεδαίμονα , ἑλόμενοι πρεσβευτὴν Τεισαμενόν .
Of these, the Trachinians, having been reduced to great weakness by the Aetaeans, who border on them, intended at first to give themselves up to the Athenians; but afterwards, fearing that they could not be trusted by them, they sent to Lacedaemon, having chosen Tisamenus as their envoy.


3.92.3
2359
ξυνεπρεσβεύοντο δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ Δωριῆς , ἡ μητρόπολις τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων , τῶν αὐτῶν δεόμενοι ·
They were joined in the embassy by the Dorians also, the mother-state of the Lacedaemonians, with the same petition;


3.92.3
2360
ὑπὸ γὰρ τῶν Οἰταίων καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐφθείροντο .
for they, too, were much injured by the Aetaeans.


3.92.4
2361
ἀκούσαντες δὲ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι γνώμην εἶχον τὴν ἀποικίαν ἐκπέμπειν , τοῖς τε Τραχινίοις βουλόμενοι καὶ τοῖς Δωριεῦσι τιμωρεῖν , καὶ ἅμα τοῦ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους πολέμου καλῶς αὐτοῖς ἐδόκει ἡ πόλις καθίστασθαι ·
On hearing their request, the Lacedaemonians determined to send out this colony, from a wish to assist both the Trachinians and the Dorians. Besides, they thought the town would be placed advantageously for them with respect to the war with the Athenians;


3.92.4
2362
ἐπί τε γὰρ τῇ Εὐβοίᾳ ναυτικὸν παρασκευασθῆναι ἄν , ὥστ’ ἐκ βραχέος τὴν διάβασιν γίγνεσθαι , τῆς τε ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης παρόδου χρησίμως ἕξειν .
for a fleet might be equipped so as to have a short passage to Euboea, and it would be useful for marching to Thrace.


3.92.4
2363
τό τε ξύμπαν ὥρμηντο τὸ χωρίον κτίζειν .
Indeed on all accounts they were anxious to found the place.


3.92.5
2364
πρῶτον μὲν οὖν ἐν Δελφοῖς τὸν θεὸν ἐπήροντο , κελεύοντος δὲ ἐξέπεμψαν τοὺς οἰκήτορας αὑτῶν τε καὶ τῶν περιοίκων , καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Ἑλλήνων τὸν βουλόμενον ἐκέλευον ἕπεσθαι πλὴν Ἰώνων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν καὶ ἔστιν ὧν ἄλλων ἐθνῶν .
They first consulted therefore the god at Delphi;


3.92.5
2365
οἰκισταὶ δὲ τρεῖς Λακεδαιμονίων ἡγήσαντο , Λέων καὶ Ἀλκίδας καὶ Δαμάγων .
and on his advising them to do it, they despatched the settlers, taken both from their own citizens and from the perioikoi, and gave permission to any of the rest of the Greeks that wished to accompany them, except Ionians, Achaeans, and some other races. Three of the Lacedaemonians led them as founders of the colony, Leon, Alcidas, and Damagon.


3.92.6
2366
καταστάντες δὲ ἐτείχισαν τὴν πόλιν ἐκ καινῆς , ἣ νῦν Ἡράκλεια καλεῖται , ἀπέχουσα Θερμοπυλῶν σταδίους μάλιστα τεσσαράκοντα , τῆς δὲ θαλάσσης εἴκοσι .
When they had established themselves in the country, they fortified anew the city which is now called Heraclea, distant about forty stades from Thermopylae, and twenty from the sea.


3.92.6
2367
νεώριά τε παρεσκευάζοντο , καὶ εἶρξαν τὸ κατὰ Θερμοπύλας κατ’ αὐτὸ τὸ στενόν , ὅπως εὐφύλακτα αὐτοῖς εἴη .
They also provided themselves with docks, beginning to build them at Thermopylae, just by the pass, that they might the more easily be defended by them.


3.93.1
2368
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι τῆς πόλεως ταύτης ξυνοικιζομένης τὸ πρῶτον ἔδεισάν τε καὶ ἐνόμισαν ἐπὶ τῇ Εὐβοίᾳ μάλιστα καθίστασθαι , ὅτι βραχύς ἐστιν ὁ διάπλους πρὸς τὸ Κήναιον τῆς Εὐβοίας .
When this town was being thus jointly founded, the Athenians were at first alarmed, thinking that it was being set up chiefly for the annoyance of Euboea, because the passage to Cinaeum in that island is a short one.


3.93.1
2369
ἔπειτα μέντοι παρὰ δόξαν αὐτοῖς ἀπέβη ·
The event, however, proved contrary to their expectations for no danger arose from it.


3.93.1
2370
οὐ γὰρ ἐγένετο ἀπ’ αὐτῆς δεινὸν οὐδέν .
And the reason was this.


3.93.2
2371
αἴτιον δὲ ἦν οἵ τε Θεσσαλοὶ ἐν δυνάμει ὄντες τῶν ταύτῃ χωρίων , καὶ ὧν ἐπὶ τῇ γῇ ἐκτίζετο , φοβούμενοι μὴ σφίσι μεγάλῃ ἰσχύι παροικῶσιν , ἔφθειρον καὶ διὰ παντὸς ἐπολέμουν ἀνθρώποις νεοκαταστάτοις , ἕως ἐξετρύχωσαν γενομένους τὸ πρῶτον καὶ πάνυ πολλούς ( πᾶς γάρ τις Λακεδαιμονίων οἰκιζόντων θαρσαλέως ᾔει , βέβαιον νομίζων τὴν πόλιν ) ·
The Thessalians, who had dominion in these parts, and to the injury of whose territory the place was being founded, fearing they might prove very powerful neighbours,


3.93.2
2372
οὐ μέντοι ἥκιστα οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων οἱ ἀφικνούμενοι τὰ πράγματά τε ἔφθειρον καὶ ἐς ὀλιγανθρωπίαν κατέστησαν , ἐκφοβήσαντες τοὺς πολλοὺς χαλεπῶς τε καὶ ἔστιν ἃ οὐ καλῶς ἐξηγούμενοι , ὥστε ῥᾷον ἤδη αὐτῶν οἱ πρόσοικοι ἐπεκράτουν .
continually harassed and made war upon the new settlers, till they wore down their strength, though at first they had been very numerous; for as the Lacedaemonians were the founders of the town, every one went to it with confidence, thinking it a place of security. It was, however, the Lacedaemonian officers themselves, who went to it, that chiefly contributed to ruining its interests, and reducing it to a scanty population, by frightening away the greater part, and governing harshly, and in some cases not fairly, so that their neighbours then prevailed over them more easily.


3.94.1
2373
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους , καὶ περὶ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον ὃν ἐν τῇ Μήλῳ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι κατείχοντο , καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν τριάκοντα νεῶν Ἀθηναῖοι περὶ Πελοπόννησον ὄντες πρῶτον ἐν Ἐλλομενῷ τῆς Λευκαδίας φρουρούς τινας λοχήσαντες διέφθειραν , ἔπειτα ὕστερον ἐπὶ Λευκάδα μείζονι στόλῳ ἦλθον , Ἀκαρνᾶσί τε πᾶσιν , οἳ πανδημεὶ πλὴν Οἰνιαδῶν ξυνέσποντο , καὶ Ζακυνθίοις καὶ Κεφαλλῆσι καὶ Κερκυραίων πέντε καὶ δέκα ναυσίν .
The same summer, and about the same time that the Athenians were detained at Melos, the forces on board the thirty ships that were cruising about the Peloponnese first of all laid an ambush at Ellomenus in Leucadia, and cut off some garrison troops; and afterwards came against Leucas with a larger force, and with all the Acarnanians, who accompanied them in a body, except the Aeniadae, and with the Zacynthians and Cephallenians, and fifteen ships of the Corcyraeans.


3.94.2
2374
καὶ οἱ μὲν Λευκάδιοι τῆς τε ἔξω γῆς δῃουμένης καὶ τῆς ἐντὸς τοῦ ἰσθμοῦ , ἐν ᾗ καὶ ἡ Λευκάς ἐστι καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος , πλήθει βιαζόμενοι ἡσύχαζον ·
The Leucadians, on the wasting of their territory, both without and within the isthmus, on which stands Leucas and the temple of Apollo, being overpowered by such numbers, remained quiet;


3.94.2
2375
οἱ δὲ Ἀκαρνᾶνες ἠξίουν Δημοσθένη τὸν στρατηγὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀποτειχίζειν αὐτούς , νομίζοντες ῥᾳδίως γ’ ἂν ἐκπολιορκῆσαι καὶ πόλεως αἰεὶ σφίσι πολεμίας ἀπαλλαγῆναι .
while the Acarnanians requested Demosthenes, the general of the Athenians, to cut them off by a wall, thinking that they might then easily take them by storm, and so be rid of a city which was always hostile to them.


3.94.3
2376
Δημοσθένης δ’ ἀναπείθεται κατὰ τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον ὑπὸ Μεσσηνίων ὡς καλὸν αὐτῷ στρατιᾶς τοσαύτης ξυνειλεγμένης Αἰτωλοῖς ἐπιθέσθαι , Ναυπάκτῳ τε πολεμίοις οὖσι καί , ἢν κρατήσῃ αὐτῶν , ῥᾳδίως καὶ τὸ ἄλλο Ἠπειρωτικὸν τὸ ταύτῃ Ἀθηναίοις προσποιήσειν .
But Demosthenes was persuaded at the same time by the Messenians that it was a fine opportunity for him, with so large an army collected together, to attack the Aetolians, who were hostile to Naupactus, and by reducing whom he would easily win for Athens the rest of the continent in these parts.


3.94.4
2377
τὸ γὰρ ἔθνος μέγα μὲν εἶναι τὸ τῶν Αἰτωλῶν καὶ μάχιμον , οἰκοῦν δὲ κατὰ κώμας ἀτειχίστους , καὶ ταύτας διὰ πολλοῦ , καὶ σκευῇ ψιλῇ χρώμενον οὐ χαλεπὸν ἀπέφαινον , πρὶν ξυμβοηθῆσαι , καταστραφῆναι .
For they represented to him that the nation of the Aetolians, though numerous and warlike, were yet not difficult to subdue before succours reached them, as they lived in unfortified villages, and those far apart, and used but light armour.


3.94.5
2378
ἐπιχειρεῖν δ’ ἐκέλευον πρῶτον μὲν Ἀποδωτοῖς , ἔπειτα δὲ Ὀφιονεῦσι καὶ μετὰ τούτους Εὐρυτᾶσιν , ὅπερ μέγιστον μέρος ἐστὶ τῶν Αἰτωλῶν , ἀγνωστότατοι δὲ γλῶσσαν καὶ ὠμοφάγοι εἰσίν , ὡς λέγονται ·
And they advised him to attack in the first place the Apodotians, next the Ophioneans, and after them the Eurytanians, which are the largest division of the nation, speaking, it is said, the most unintelligible language, and being cannibals;


3.94.5
2379
τούτων γὰρ ληφθέντων ῥᾳδίως καὶ τ- ἄλλα προσχωρήσειν .
for if these were subdued, the rest would readily surrender.


3.95.1
2380
ὁ δὲ τῶν Μεσσηνίων χάριτι πεισθεὶς καὶ μάλιστα νομίσας ἄνευ τῆς τῶν Ἀθηναίων δυνάμεως τοῖς ἠπειρώταις ξυμμάχοις μετὰ τῶν Αἰτωλῶν δύνασθαι ἂν κατὰ γῆν ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ Βοιωτοὺς διὰ Λοκρῶν τῶν Ὀζολῶν ἐς Κυτίνιον τὸ Δωρικόν , ἐν δεξιᾷ ἔχων τὸν Παρνασσόν , ἕως καταβαίη ἐς Φωκέας , οἳ προθύμως ἐδόκουν κατὰ τὴν Ἀθηναίων αἰεί ποτε φιλίαν ξυστρατεύσειν ἢ κἂν βίᾳ προσαχθῆναι ( καὶ Φωκεῦσιν ἤδη ὅμορος ἡ Βοιωτία ἐστίν ) , ἄρας οὖν ξύμπαντι τῷ στρατεύματι ἀπὸ τῆς Λευκάδος ἀκόντων τῶν Ἀκαρνάνων παρέπλευσεν ἐς Σόλλιον .
He consented to do so, out of regard for the Messenians, and still more because he thought, that without employing the forces of Athens, with only continental tribes as his allies, and with the Aetolians, he would be able to go by land against the Boeotians, through the Locri Ozolae to Cytinium in Doris, keeping Parnassus on his right hand till he reached the Phocians, who, he thought, would eagerly join him, for the friendship they had always borne the Athenians, or might be brought over by force; and to Phocis Boeotia is at once the bordering state. Starting therefore with all his armament from Leucas, in opposition to the wishes of the Acarnanians, lie coasted along to Sollium.


3.95.2
2381
κοινώσας δὲ τὴν ἐπίνοιαν τοῖς Ἀκαρνᾶσιν , ὡς οὐ προσεδέξαντο διὰ τῆς Λευκάδος τὴν οὐ περιτείχισιν , αὐτὸς τῇ λοιπῇ στρατιᾷ , Κεφαλλῆσι καὶ Μεσσηνίοις καὶ Ζακυνθίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίων τριακοσίοις τοῖς ἐπιβάταις τῶν σφετέρων νεῶν ( αἱ γὰρ πέντε καὶ δέκα τῶν Κερκυραίων ἀπῆλθον νῆες ) , ἐστράτευσεν ἐπ’ Αἰτωλούς .
There he communicated his plan to the Acarnanians; and when they did not assent to it in consequence of his refusal to invest Leucas, he himself with the remainder of the force, the Cephallenians, Messenians, Zacynthians, and the three hundred from his own ships, (for the fifteen Corcyraean vessels had gone away,) made an expedition against the Aetolians.


3.95.3
2382
ὡρμᾶτο δὲ ἐξ Οἰνεῶνος τῆς Λοκρίδος .
He had his head-quarters at Aeneon in Locris.


3.95.3
2383
οἱ δὲ Ὀζόλαι οὗτοι Λοκροὶ ξύμμαχοι ἦσαν , καὶ ἔδει αὐτοὺς πανστρατιᾷ ἀπαντῆσαι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐς τὴν μεσόγειαν ·
Now the Locri Ozolae were allies of the Athenians, and were to meet them in full force in the heart of the country;


3.95.3
2384
ὄντες γὰρ ὅμοροι τοῖς Αἰτωλοῖς καὶ ὁμόσκευοι μεγάλη ὠφελία ἐδόκουν εἶναι ξυστρατεύοντες μάχης τε ἐμπειρίᾳ τῆς ἐκείνων καὶ χωρίων .
for as they bordered on the Aetolians, and were similarly equipped, they were thought likely to prove of great service in acting with them, from their acquaintance both with the Aetolian mode of fighting and with the localities.


3.96.1
2385
αὐλισάμενος δὲ τῷ στρατῷ ἐν τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ Νεμείου τῷ ἱερῷ , ἐν ᾧ Ἡσίοδος ὁ ποιητὴς λέγεται ὑπὸ τῶν ταύτῃ ἀποθανεῖν , χρησθὲν αὐτῷ ἐν Νεμέᾳ τοῦτο παθεῖν , ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ ἄρας ἐπορεύετο ἐς τὴν Αἰτωλίαν .
After bivouacking with the army in the sacred precinct of the Nemean Jupiter, in which Hesiod the poet is said to have been killed by the people of this country, an oracle having before declared that he should meet with this fate at Nemea; in the morning he set out and marched into Aetolia.


3.96.2
2386
καὶ αἱρεῖ τῇ πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ Ποτιδανίαν καὶ τῇ δευτέρᾳ Κροκύλειον καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ Τείχιον , ἔμενέ τε αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν λείαν ἐς Εὐπάλιον τῆς Λοκρίδος ἀπέπεμψεν ·
On the first day he took Potidanea; on the second, Crocyleum; and on the third, Tichium, where he halted, and sent off his booty to Eupalium in Locris:


3.96.2
2387
τὴν γὰρ γνώμην εἶχε τὰ ἄλλα καταστρεψάμενος οὕτως ἐπὶ Ὀφιονέας , εἰ μὴ βούλοιντο ξυγχωρεῖν , ἐς Ναύπακτον ἐπαναχωρήσας στρατεῦσαι ὕστερον .
for he intended, when he had subdued the other parts, to make a subsequent expedition against the Ophionians, if they would not surrender, after returning to Naupactus.


3.96.3
2388
τοὺς δὲ Αἰτωλοὺς οὐκ ἐλάνθανεν αὕτη ἡ παρασκευὴ οὔτε ὅτε τὸ πρῶτον ἐπεβουλεύετο , ἐπειδή τε ὁ στρατὸς ἐσεβεβλήκει , πολλῇ χειρὶ ἐπεβοήθουν πάντες , ὥστε καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι Ὀφιονέων οἱ πρὸς τὸν Μηλιακὸν κόλπον καθήκοντες Βωμιῆς καὶ Καλλιῆς ἐβοήθησαν .
But the Aetolians were both aware or these preparations when he first formed his designs against them, and when the army had invaded their country they came to the rescue with a great force, all of them, so that even the most distant of the Ophionians, who stretch towards the Melian Gulf, the Borniensians and Calliensians, joined in bringing aid.


3.97.1
2389
τῷ δὲ Δημοσθένει τοιόνδε τι οἱ Μεσσήνιοι παρῄνουν ·
Now the Messenians gave Demosthenes the following advice, as they also did at first.


3.97.1
2390
ὅπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἀναδιδάσκοντες αὐτὸν τῶν Αἰτωλῶν ὡς εἴη ῥᾳδία ἡ αἵρεσις , ἰέναι ἐκέλευον ὅτι τάχιστα ἐπὶ τὰς κώμας καὶ μὴ μένειν ἕως ἂν ξύμπαντες ἁθροισθέντες ἀντιτάξωνται , τὴν δ’ ἐν ποσὶν αἰεὶ πειρᾶσθαι αἱρεῖν .
Assuring him that the reduction of the Aetolians was easy, they urged him to go as quickly as possible against their villages, and not wait till the whole people should unite and oppose him, but to endeavour successively to make himself master of each village before him.


3.97.2
2391
ὁ δὲ τούτοις τε πεισθεὶς καὶ τῇ τύχῃ ἐλπίσας , ὅτι οὐδὲν αὐτῷ ἠναντιοῦτο , τοὺς Λοκροὺς οὐκ ἀναμείνας οὓς αὐτῷ ἔδει προσβοηθῆσαι ( ψιλῶν γὰρ ἀκοντιστῶν ἐνδεὴς ἦν μάλιστα ) ἐχώρει ἐπὶ Αἰγιτίου , καὶ κατὰ κράτος αἱρεῖ ἐπιών .
Being thus persuaded by them, and relying on his fortune, because nothing ever went against him, without waiting for those who should have reinforced him (for he was most in want of light-armed dartmen) he advanced for Aegitium, and took it by assault,


3.97.2
2392
ὑπέφευγον γὰρ οἱ ἄνθρωποι καὶ ἐκάθηντο ἐπὶ τῶν λόφων τῶν ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ·
the inhabitants flying before him, and posting themselves on the hills round the town;


3.97.2
2393
ἦν γὰρ ἐφ’ ὑψηλῶν χωρίων ἀπέχουσα τῆς θαλάσσης ὀγδοήκοντα σταδίους μάλιστα .
for it stood on high ground, at the distance of about eighty stades from the sea.


3.97.3
2394
οἱ δὲ Αἰτωλοί ( βεβοηθηκότες γὰρ ἤδη ἦσαν ἐπὶ τὸ Αἰγίτιον ) προσέβαλλον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις καταθέοντες ἀπὸ τῶν λόφων ἄλλοι ἄλλοθεν καὶ ἐσηκόντιζον , καὶ ὅτε μὲν ἐπίοι τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατόπεδον , ὑπεχώρουν , ἀναχωροῦσι δὲ ἐπέκειντο ·
The Aetolians (for they had now come to the rescue of Aegitium) charged the Athenians and their allies, running down from the hills in different directions, and plied them with darts;


3.97.3
2395
καὶ ἦν ἐπὶ πολὺ τοιαύτη ἡ μάχη , διώξεις τε καὶ ὑπαγωγαί , ἐν οἷς ἀμφοτέροις ἥσσους ἦσαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι .
retreating when the Athenian force advanced against them, and pressing it close when it retired. And for a long time this was the character of the engagement—repeated pursuing and retreating—in both of which the Athenians had the worse.


3.98.1
2396
μέχρι μὲν οὖν οἱ τοξόται εἶχόν τε τὰ βέλη αὐτοῖς καὶ οἷοί τε ἦσαν χρῆσθαι , οἱ δὲ ἀντεῖχον ( τοξευόμενοι γὰρ οἱ Αἰτωλοὶ ἄνθρωποι ψιλοὶ ἀνεστέλλοντο ) ·
Now so long as they saw that their archers had their arrows and were able to use them, they continued to resist; for, when harassed by the bowmen, the Aetolians, being a light-armed force, retired.


3.98.1
2397
ἐπειδὴ δὲ τοῦ τε τοξάρχου ἀποθανόντος οὗτοι διεσκεδάσθησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐκεκμήκεσαν καὶ ἐπὶ πολὺ τῷ αὐτῷ πόνῳ ξυνεχόμενοι , οἵ τε Αἰτωλοὶ ἐνέκειντο καὶ ἐσηκόντιζον , οὕτω δὴ τραπόμενοι ἔφευγον , καὶ ἐσπίπτοντες ἔς τε χαράδρας ἀνεκβάτους καὶ χωρία ὧν οὐκ ἦσαν ἔμπειροι διεφθείροντο ·
But when, after the fall of their leader, the archers were dispersed, and they themselves distressed by enduring for a long time the same labour, and the Aetolians were pressing hard on them, and pouring their darts on them; then indeed they turned and fled, and falling into pathless ravines and places with which they were unacquainted, were cut off:


3.98.1
2398
καὶ γὰρ ὁ ἡγεμὼν αὐτοῖς τῶν ὁδῶν Χρόμων ὁ Μεσσήνιος ἐτύγχανε τεθνηκώς .
for the guide who showed them the way, Chromon the Messenian, had been killed.


3.98.2
2399
οἱ δὲ Αἰτωλοὶ ἐσακοντίζοντες πολλοὺς μὲν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ τροπῇ κατὰ πόδας αἱροῦντες ἄνθρωποι ποδώκεις καὶ ψιλοὶ διέφθειρον , τοὺς δὲ πλείους τῶν ὁδῶν ἁμαρτάνοντας καὶ ἐς τὴν ὕλην ἐσφερομένους , ὅθεν διέξοδοι οὐκ ἦσαν , πῦρ κομισάμενοι περιεπίμπρασαν ·
And the Aetolians, still plying them with missiles, by their rapid movements (for they are swift of foot and light-armed) took many of them there in the rout, and put them to the sword; but the greater part missing their way and rushing into the forest, from which there were no roads out, they brought fire and burnt it round them.


3.98.3
2400
πᾶσά τε ἰδέα κατέστη τῆς φυγῆς καὶ τοῦ ὀλέθρου τῷ στρατοπέδῳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , μόλις τε ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ τὸν Οἰνεῶνα τῆς Λοκρίδος , ὅθεν περ καὶ ὡρμήθησαν , οἱ περιγενόμενοι κατέφυγον .
Indeed the Athenian forces were subjected to every form of flight and death, and it was with difficulty that the survivors escaped to the sea and to Oeneon in Locris, the same place from which they had set out.


3.98.4
2401
ἀπέθανον δὲ τῶν τε ξυμμάχων πολλοὶ καὶ αὐτῶν Ἀθηναίων ὁπλῖται περὶ εἴκοσι μάλιστα καὶ ἑκατόν .
Great numbers of the allies were slain, and of the Athenians themselves about a hundred and twenty heavy-armed—so many in number, and all in the prime of their youth.


3.98.4
2402
τοσοῦτοι μὲν τὸ πλῆθος καὶ ἡλικία ἡ αὐτὴ οὗτοι βέλτιστοι δὴ ἄνδρες ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τῷδε ἐκ τῆς Ἀθηναίων πόλεως διεφθάρησαν ·
These were the best men of the city of Athens that fell during this war.


3.98.4
2403
ἀπέθανε δὲ καὶ ὁ ἕτερος στρατηγὸς Προκλῆς .
One of the generals also, namely, Procles, was slain.


3.98.5
2404
τοὺς δὲ νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀνελόμενοι παρὰ τῶν Αἰτωλῶν καὶ ἀναχωρήσαντες ἐς Ναύπακτον ὕστερον ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐκομίσθησαν .
Having taken up their dead under truce, and retired to Naupactus, they afterwards went with their ships to Athens.


3.98.5
2405
Δημοσθένης δὲ περὶ Ναύπακτον καὶ τὰ χωρία ταῦτα ὑπελείφθη , τοῖς πεπραγμένοις φοβούμενος τοὺς Ἀθηναίους .
But Demosthenes staved behind in the neighbourhood of Naupactus and those parts, being afraid of the Athenians in consequence of what had been done.


3.99.1
2406
κατὰ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους καὶ οἱ περὶ Σικελίαν Ἀθηναῖοι πλεύσαντες ἐς τὴν Λοκρίδα ἐν ἀποβάσει τέ τινι τοὺς προσβοηθήσαντας Λοκρῶν ἐκράτησαν καὶ περιπόλιον αἱροῦσιν ὃ ἦν ἐπὶ τῷ Ἄληκι ποταμῷ .
About the same period the Athenians on the coast of Sicily sailed to Locris, and in a descent which they made on the country, defeated those of the Locrians who came against them, and took a guard-fort which stood on the river Halex.


3.100.1
2407
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους Αἰτωλοὶ προπέμψαντες πρότερον ἔς τε Κόρινθον καὶ ἐς Λακεδαίμονα πρέσβεις , Τόλοφόν τε τὸν Ὀφιονέα καὶ Βοριάδην τὸν Εὐρυτᾶνα καὶ Τείσανδρον τὸν Ἀποδωτόν , πείθουσιν ὥστε σφίσι πέμψαι στρατιὰν ἐπὶ Ναύπακτον διὰ τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπαγωγήν .
The same summer the Aetolians, having before [the invasion of their country] sent as envoys to Corinth and Lacedaemon, Tolophus the Ophionean, Boriades the Eurytanian, and Tisander the Apodotian, persuaded them to send them an army to attack Naupactus, because it had brought the Athenians against them.


3.100.2
2408
καὶ ἐξέπεμψαν Λακεδαιμόνιοι περὶ τὸ φθινόπωρον τρισχιλίους ὁπλίτας τῶν ξυμμάχων .
And the Lacedaemonians despatched about autumn three thousand heavy-armed of the allies;


3.100.2
2409
τούτων ἦσαν πεντακόσιοι ἐξ Ἡρακλείας τῆς ἐν Τραχῖνι πόλεως τότε νεοκτίστου οὔσης ·
five hundred of whom were from Heraclea, their newly founded city in Trachis.


3.100.2
2410
Σπαρτιάτης δ’ ἦρχεν Εὐρύλοχος τῆς στρατιᾶς , καὶ ξυνηκολούθουν αὐτῷ Μακάριος καὶ Μενεδάϊος οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται .
Eurylochus, a Spartan, had the command of the force, accompanied by Macarius and Menedaeus, who were also Spartans.


3.101.1
2411
ξυλλεγέντος δὲ τοῦ στρατεύματος ἐς Δελφοὺς ἐπεκηρυκεύετο Εὐρύλοχος Λοκροῖς τοῖς Ὀζόλαις ·
When the army had assembled at Delphi, Eurylochus sent a herald to the Locri Ozole;


3.101.1
2412
διὰ τούτων γὰρ ἡ ὁδὸς ἦν ἐς Ναύπακτον , καὶ ἅμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐβούλετο ἀποστῆσαι αὐτούς .
for the route to Naupactus was through their territory, and moreover he wished to make them revolt from the Athenians.


3.101.2
2413
ξυνέπρασσον δὲ μάλιστα αὐτῷ τῶν Λοκρῶν Ἀμφισσῆς διὰ τὸ τῶν Φωκέων ἔχθος δεδιότες ·
Those amongst the Locrians who most forwarded his views were the Amphissians, who were alarmed in consequence of the enmity of the Phocians.


3.101.2
2414
καὶ αὐτοὶ πρῶτοι δόντες ὁμήρους καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἔπεισαν δοῦναι φοβουμένους τὸν ἐπιόντα στρατόν , πρῶτον μὲν οὖν τοὺς ὁμόρους αὐτοῖς Μυονέας ( ταύτῃ γὰρ δυσεσβολώτατος ἡ Λοκρίς ) , ἔπειτα Ἰπνέας καὶ Μεσσαπίους καὶ Τριταιέας καὶ Χαλαίους καὶ Τολοφωνίους καὶ Ἡσσίους καὶ Οἰανθέας .
These first gave hostages themselves, and persuaded the rest to do so, in their fear of the invading army; first the Myoneans, who were their neighbours, (for on this side Locris is most difficult to enter,) then the Ipneans, Messapians, Tritaens, Chalaeans, Tolophonians, Hessians, and Oeantheans.


3.101.2
2415
οὗτοι καὶ ξυνεστράτευον πάντες .
All these joined the expedition also.


3.101.2
2416
Ὀλπαῖοι δὲ ὁμήρους μὲν ἔδοσαν , ἠκολούθουν δὲ οὔ ·
The Olpnaean gave hostages, but did not accompany them;


3.101.2
2417
καὶ Ὑαῖοι οὐκ ἔδοσαν ὁμήρους πρὶν αὐτῶν εἷλον κώμην Πόλιν ὄνομα ἔχουσαν .
while the Hyaeans refused to give hostages, till they took a village belonging to them, called Polis.


3.102.1
2418
ἐπειδὴ δὲ παρεσκεύαστο πάντα καὶ τοὺς ὁμήρους κατέθετο ἐς Κυτίνιον τὸ Δωρικόν , ἐχώρει τῷ στρατῷ ἐπὶ τὴν Ναύπακτον διὰ τῶν Λοκρῶν , καὶ πορευόμενος Οἰνεῶνα αἱρεῖ αὐτῶν καὶ Εὐπάλιον ·
When every thing was prepared, and he had placed the hostages at Cytinium in Doris, he advanced with his army against Naupactus, through the territory of the Locrians;


3.102.1
2419
οὐ γὰρ προσεχώρησαν .
and on his march took Oeneon, one of their towns, and Eupalium; for they refused to surrender.


3.102.2
2420
γενόμενοι δ’ ἐν τῇ Ναυπακτίᾳ καὶ οἱ Αἰτωλοὶ ἅμα ἤδη προσβεβοηθηκότες ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν καὶ τὸ προάστειον ἀτείχιστον ὂν εἷλον ·
When they had reached the Naupactian territory, and the Aetolians also had now come to their aid, they ravaged the country, and took the suburb of the capital, which was unfortified.


3.102.2
2421
ἐπί τε Μολύκρειον ἐλθόντες τὴν Κορινθίων μὲν ἀποικίαν , Ἀθηναίων δὲ ὑπήκοον , αἱροῦσιν .
They also went against and took Molyenium, which, though a colony from Corinth, was subject to the Athenians.


3.102.3
2422
Δημοσθένης δὲ ὁ Ἀθηναῖος ( ἔτι γὰρ ἐτύγχανεν ὢν μετὰ τὰ ἐκ τῆς Αἰτωλίας περὶ Ναύπακτον ) προαισθόμενος τοῦ στρατοῦ καὶ δείσας περὶ αὐτῆς , ἐλθὼν πείθει Ἀκαρνᾶνας , χαλεπῶς διὰ τὴν ἐκ τῆς Λευκάδος ἀναχώρησιν , βοηθῆσαι Ναυπάκτῳ .
Now Demosthenes, the Athenian, (for after what had happened in Aetolia, he was still in the neighbourhood of Naupactus) having previous notice of the armament, and being alarmed for the town, went and persuaded the Acarnanians (though with difficulty, on account of his retreat from Leucas) to go to the relief of Naupactus.


3.102.4
2423
καὶ πέμπουσι μετ’ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῶν νεῶν χιλίους ὁπλίτας , οἳ ἐσελθόντες περιεποίησαν τὸ χωρίον ·
Accordingly they sent with him on board his ships a thousand heavy-armed, who threw themselves into the place and saved it.


3.102.4
2424
δεινὸν γὰρ ἦν μὴ μεγάλου ὄντος τοῦ τείχους , ὀλίγων δὲ τῶν ἀμυνομένων , οὐκ ἀντίσχωσιν .
For the walls being extensive, and the garrison small, there was reason to fear that they might not hold out.


3.102.5
2425
Εὐρύλοχος δὲ καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ ὡς ᾔσθοντο τὴν στρατιὰν ἐσεληλυθυῖαν καὶ ἀδύνατον ὂν τὴν πόλιν βίᾳ ἑλεῖν , ἀνεχώρησαν οὐκ ἐπὶ Πελοποννήσου , ἀλλ’ ἐς τὴν Αἰολίδα τὴν νῦν καλουμένην Καλυδῶνα καὶ Πλευρῶνα καὶ ἐς τὰ ταύτῃ χωρία καὶ ἐς Πρόσχιον τῆς Αἰτωλίας .
When Eurylochus and his colleagues found that this force had entered the town, and that it was impossible to take it by storm, they withdrew, not towards the Peloponnese, but to Aeolis, which is now called Calydon and Pleuron, with the places in that quarter, and to Proschium in Aetolia.


3.102.6
2426
οἱ γὰρ Ἀμπρακιῶται ἐλθόντες πρὸς αὐτοὺς πείθουσιν ὥστε μετὰ σφῶν Ἄργει τε τῷ Ἀμφιλοχικῷ καὶ Ἀμφιλοχίᾳ τῇ ἄλλῃ ἐπιχειρῆσαι καὶ Ἀκαρνανίᾳ ἅμα , λέγοντες ὅτι , ἢν τούτων κρατήσωσι , πᾶν τὸ ἠπειρωτικὸν Λακεδαιμονίοις ξύμμαχον καθεστήξει .
For the Ambraciots had come to them, and urged them to make, in concert with themselves, an attack upon the Amphilochian Argos and the rest of that country, and upon Acarnania at the same time; telling them that if they made themselves masters of these countries, the whole of the continent would be united in alliance with the Lacedaemonians.


3.102.7
2427
καὶ ὁ μὲν Εὐρύλοχος πεισθεὶς καὶ τοὺς Αἰτωλοὺς ἀφεὶς ἡσύχαζε τῷ στρατῷ περὶ τοὺς χώρους τούτους , ἕως τοῖς Ἀμπρακιώταις ἐκστρατευσαμένοις περὶ τὸ Ἄργος δέοι βοηθεῖν .
So Eurylochus consented, and having dismissed the Aetolians, remained quiet with his army in that neighbourhood, till he should have to assist the Ambraciots, on their taking the field before Argos.


3.102.7
2428
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And so the summer ended.


3.103.1
2429
οἱ δ’ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῦ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος ἐπελθόντες μετὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ξυμμάχων καὶ ὅσοι Σικελῶν κατὰ κράτος ἀρχόμενοι ὑπὸ Συρακοσίων καὶ ξύμμαχοι ὄντες ἀποστάντες αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ Συρακοσίων ξυνεπολέμουν , ἐπ’ Ἴνησσαν τὸ Σικελικὸν πόλισμα , οὗ τὴν ἀκρόπολιν Συρακόσιοι εἶχον , προσέβαλον , καὶ ὡς οὐκ ἐδύναντο ἑλεῖν , ἀπῇσαν .
The following winter, the Athenians in Sicily having marched with their Grecian allies, and as many of the Sieels as joined them in the war—being either subject by force to the Syracusans or allies who had revolted from them—against Inessa, the Sieel town, the citadel of which was held by the Syracusans, attacked it, and, not being able to take it, retired.


3.103.2
2430
ἐν δὲ τῇ ἀναχωρήσει ὑστέροις Ἀθηναίων τοῖς ξυμμάχοις ἀναχωροῦσιν ἐπιτίθενται οἱ ἐκ τοῦ τειχίσματος Συρακόσιοι , καὶ προσπεσόντες τρέπουσί τε μέρος τι τοῦ στρατοῦ καὶ ἀπέκτειναν οὐκ ὀλίγους .
On their return, the Syracusans from the citadel fell on the allies as they were retiring somewhat after the Athenians, and routed a division of their army, and killed no small number.


3.103.3
2431
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν ὁ Λάχης καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὴν Λοκρίδα ἀποβάσεις τινὰς ποιησάμενοι κατὰ τὸν Καϊκῖνον ποταμὸν τοὺς προσβοηθοῦντας Λοκρῶν μετὰ Προξένου τοῦ Καπάτωνος ὡς τριακοσίους μάχῃ ἐκράτησαν καὶ ὅπλα λαβόντες ἀπεχώρησαν .
After this, Laches and the Athenians, with the fleet, made some descents upon the Locrian territory, by the river Coecinus, and defeated in battle those of the Locrians who came out against them with Proxenus the son of Capaton, about three hundred in number, and having taken some arms, departed.


3.104.1
2432
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος καὶ Δῆλον ἐκάθηραν Ἀθηναῖοι κατὰ χρησμὸν δή τινα .
The same winter also the Athenians purified Delos, in obedience, as they professed, to a certain oracle.


3.104.1
2433
ἐκάθηρε μὲν γὰρ καὶ Πεισίστρατος ὁ τύραννος πρότερον αὐτήν , οὐχ ἅπασαν , ἀλλ’ ὅσον ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἐφεωρᾶτο τῆς νήσου ·
For Pisistratus the tyrant had also purified it before; not the whole of the island, but as much of it as was within sight of the temple.


3.104.1
2434
τότε δὲ πᾶσα ἐκαθάρθη τοιῷδε τρόπῳ .
At this time, however, the whole of it was purified in the following manner.


3.104.2
2435
θῆκαι ὅσαι ἦσαν τῶν τεθνεώτων ἐν Δήλῳ , πάσας ἀνεῖλον , καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν προεῖπον μήτε ἐναποθνῄσκειν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ μήτε ἐντίκτειν , ἀλλ’ ἐς τὴν Ῥήνειαν διακομίζεσθαι .
All the sepulchres of those who had died in Delos they removed, and commanded that in future no one should either die in the island or bear a child, but that [in such cases all should] be carried across to Rhenea.


3.104.2
2436
ἀπέχει δὲ ἡ Ῥήνεια τῆς Δήλου οὕτως ὀλίγον ὥστε Πολυκράτης ὁ Σαμίων τύραννος ἰσχύσας τινὰ χρόνον ναυτικῷ καὶ τῶν τε ἄλλων νήσων ἄρξας καὶ τὴν Ῥήνειαν ἑλὼν ἀνέθηκε τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι τῷ Δηλίῳ ἁλύσει δήσας πρὸς τὴν Δῆλον .
(This Rhenea is so short a distance from Delos, that Polycrates the tyrant of Samos, after being powerful at sea for a considerable time, and ruling over the rest of the islands, and taking Rhenea, dedicated it to the Delian Apollo, by connecting it with Delos by a chain.)


3.104.2
2437
καὶ τὴν πεντετηρίδα τότε πρῶτον μετὰ τὴν κάθαρσιν ἐποίησαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ Δήλια .
It was at this time too, after the purification, that the Athenians first celebrated the quinquennial festival of the Delian games.


3.104.3
2438
ἦν δέ ποτε καὶ τὸ πάλαι μεγάλη ξύνοδος ἐς τὴν Δῆλον τῶν Ἰώνων τε καὶ περικτιόνων νησιωτῶν ·
There had been, however, even in very early times, a great assembly of the Ionians and the neighbouring islanders held at Delos;


3.104.3
2439
ξύν τε γὰρ γυναιξὶ καὶ παισὶν ἐθεώρουν , ὥσπερ νῦν ἐς τὰ Ἐφέσια Ἴωνες , καὶ ἀγὼν ἐποιεῖτο αὐτόθι καὶ γυμνικὸς καὶ μουσικός , χορούς τε ἀνῆγον αἱ πόλεις .
for they used to come to the feast with their wives and children, as the Ionians now do to the Ephesian festivals, and gymnastic and musical contests were held, and the different cities took up bands of dancers.


3.104.4
2440
δηλοῖ δὲ μάλιστα Ὅμηρος ὅτι τοιαῦτα ἦν ἐν τοῖς ἔπεσι τοῖσδε , ἅ ἐστιν ἐκ προοιμίου Ἀπόλλωνος ·
Homer shows most clearly that such was the case, in the following verses, taken from a hymn to Apollo.


3.104.4
2441
ἀλλ’ ὅτε Δήλῳ , Φοῖβε , μάλιστά γε θυμὸν ἐτέρφθης , ἔνθα τοι ἑλκεχίτωνες Ἰάονες ἠγερέθονται σὺν σφοῖσιν τεκέεσσι γυναιξί τε σὴν ἐς ἀγυιάν ·
"Anon to Delos, Phoebus, wouldst thou come,


3.104.4
2442
ἔνθα σε πυγμαχίῃ τε καὶ ὀρχηστυῖ καὶ ἀοιδῇ μνησάμενοι τέρπουσιν , ὅταν καθέσωσιν ἀγῶνα .
Still most delighting in thine island-home;Where the long-robed Ionians thronging meet,With wives and children, at thy hallow'd seat;With buffets, dance, and song extol thy name,And win thy smile upon their solemn game."


3.104.5
2443
ὅτι δὲ καὶ μουσικῆς ἀγὼν ἦν καὶ ἀγωνιούμενοι ἐφοίτων ἐν τοῖσδε αὖ δηλοῖ , ἅ ἐστιν ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ προοιμίου ·
That there was a musical contest also, and that they went to take part in it, he shows again in the following verses, taken from the same hymn.


3.104.5
2444
τὸν γὰρ Δηλιακὸν χορὸν τῶν γυναικῶν ὑμνήσας ἐτελεύτα τοῦ ἐπαίνου ἐς τάδε τὰ ἔπη , ἐν οἷς καὶ ἑαυτοῦ ἐπεμνήσθη ·
For after mentioning the Delian dance of the women, he ends his praise of the god with these verses, in which he also makes mention of himself.


3.104.5
2445
ἀλλ’ ἄγεθ’ , ἱλήκοι μὲν Ἀπόλλων Ἀρτέμιδι ξύν , χαίρετε δ’ ὑμεῖς πᾶσαι .
"Now be Apollo kind, and Dian too;


3.104.5
2446
ἐμεῖο δὲ καὶ μετόπισθε μνήσασθ’ , ὁππότε κέν τις ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων ἐνθάδ’ ἀνείρηται ταλαπείριος ἄλλος ἐπελθών ·
And ye, fair Delian damsels, all adieu!


3.104.5
2447
&quot; ὦ κοῦραι , τίς δ’ ὔμμιν ἀνὴρ ἥδιστος ἀοιδῶν ἐνθάδε πωλεῖται , καὶ τέῳ τέρπεσθε μάλιστα ;’ ὑμεῖς δ’ εὖ μάλα πᾶσαι ὑποκρίνασθαι ἀφήμως ·
But in your memory grant me still a home;And oft as to your sacred isle may comeA pilgrim care-worn denizen of earth,And ask, while joining in your social mirth,


3.104.5
2448
&quot; τυφλὸς ἀνήρ , οἰκεῖ δὲ Χίῳ ἔνι παιπαλοέσσῃ &quot; .
"Maidens, of all the bards that seek your coast,"Who sings the sweetest, and who charms you most?"Then answer one and all, with gracious smile, A blind old man who lives in Chios' rocky isle."


3.104.6
2449
τοσαῦτα μὲν Ὅμηρος ἐτεκμηρίωσεν ὅτι ἦν καὶ τὸ πάλαι μεγάλη ξύνοδος καὶ ἑορτὴ ἐν τῇ Δήλῳ ·
Such evidence does Homer afford of there having been, even in early times, a great assembly and festival at Delos.


3.104.6
2450
ὕστερον δὲ τοὺς μὲν χοροὺς οἱ νησιῶται καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι μεθ’ ἱερῶν ἔπεμπον , τὰ δὲ περὶ τοὺς ἀγῶνας καὶ τὰ πλεῖστα κατελύθη ὑπὸ ξυμφορῶν , ὡς εἰκός , πρὶν δὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τότε τὸν ἀγῶνα ἐποίησαν καὶ ἱπποδρομίας , ὃ πρότερον οὐκ ἦν .
But afterwards, though the islanders and the Athenians sent the bands of dancers with sacrifices, the games and the greater part of the observances were abolished—as is most probable, through adversity—until the Athenians held the games at that time, with horse-races, which before had not been usual.


3.105.1
2451
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος Ἀμπρακιῶται , ὥσπερ ὑποσχόμενοι Εὐρυλόχῳ τὴν στρατιὰν κατέσχον , ἐκστρατεύονται ἐπὶ Ἄργος τὸ Ἀμφιλοχικὸν τρισχιλίοις ὁπλίταις , καὶ ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τὴν Ἀργείαν καταλαμβάνουσιν Ὄλπας , τεῖχος ἐπὶ λόφου ἰσχυρὸν πρὸς τῇ θαλάσσῃ , ὅ ποτε Ἀκαρνᾶνες τειχισάμενοι κοινῷ δικαστηρίῳ ἐχρῶντο ·
The same winter the Ambraciots, as they had promised Eurylochus when they retained his army, marched forth against the Amphilochian Argos with three thousand heavy-armed;


3.105.1
2452
ἀπέχει δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀργείων πόλεως ἐπιθαλασσίας οὔσης πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι σταδίους μάλιστα .
and entering the Argive territory, occupied Olpae, a strong-hold on a hill near the sea, which the Acarnanians had once fortified, and used as their common place of meeting for judicial purposes; its distance from the city of Argos on the coast being about twenty-five stades.


3.105.2
2453
οἱ δὲ Ἀκαρνᾶνες οἱ μὲν ἐς Ἄργος ξυνεβοήθουν , οἱ δὲ τῆς Ἀμφιλοχίας ἐν τούτῳ τῷ χωρίῳ ὃ Κρῆναι καλεῖται , φυλάσσοντες τοὺς μετὰ Εὐρυλόχου Πελοποννησίους μὴ λάθωσι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀμπρακιώτας διελθόντες , ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο .
Now some of the Acarnanians went to the relief of Argos, while others encamped in Amphilochia, in the place called Crenae, being on the watch to prevent the Peloponnesians with Eurylochus passing through unobserved to the Ambraciots.


3.105.3
2454
πέμπουσι δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ Δημοσθένη τὸν ἐς τὴν Αἰτωλίαν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγήσαντα , ὅπως σφίσιν ἡγεμὼν γίγνηται , καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς εἴκοσι ναῦς Ἀθηναίων αἳ ἔτυχον περὶ Πελοπόννησον οὖσαι , ὧν ἦρχεν Ἀριστοτέλης τε ὁ Τιμοκράτους καὶ Ἱεροφῶν ὁ Ἀντιμνήστου .
They also sent for Demosthenes, who had commanded the Athenian expedition against Aetolia, to be their leader; and for the twenty Athenian ships that happened to be cruising about the Peloponnese, under the command of Aristoteles son of Timocrates, and Hierophon son of Antimnestus.


3.105.4
2455
ἀπέστειλαν δὲ καὶ ἄγγελον οἱ περὶ τὰς Ὄλπας Ἀμπρακιῶται ἐς τὴν πόλιν κελεύοντες σφίσι βοηθεῖν πανδημεί , δεδιότες μὴ οἱ μετ’ Εὐρυλόχου οὐ δύνωνται διελθεῖν τοὺς Ἀκαρνᾶνας καὶ σφίσιν ἢ μονωθεῖσιν ἡ μάχη γένηται ἢ ἀναχωρεῖν βουλομένοις οὐκ ᾖ ἀσφαλές .
The Ambraciots at Olpae also sent a messenger to their city, desiring them to come in full force to their assistance, fearing that the troops under Eurylochus might not be able to effect a passage through the Acarnanians, and that they themselves might either have to fight unsupported, or, if they wished to retreat, find it unsafe to do so.


3.106.1
2456
οἱ μὲν οὖν μετ’ Εὐρυλόχου Πελοποννήσιοι ὡς ᾔσθοντο τοὺς ἐν Ὄλπαις Ἀμπρακιώτας ἥκοντας , ἄραντες ἐκ τοῦ Προσχίου ἐβοήθουν κατὰ τάχος , καὶ διαβάντες τὸν Ἀχελῷον ἐχώρουν δι’ Ἀκαρνανίας οὔσης ἐρήμου διὰ τὴν ἐς Ἄργος βοήθειαν , ἐν δεξιᾷ μὲν ἔχοντες τὴν Στρατίων πόλιν καὶ τὴν φρουρὰν αὐτῶν , ἐν ἀριστερᾷ δὲ τὴν ἄλλην Ἀκαρνανίαν .
The Peloponnesians with Eurylochus, therefore, finding that the Ambraciots at Olpae were come, set out from Proschium and went as quickly as possible to their aid; and having crossed the Acheloüs, proceeded through Acarnania, which was left deserted in consequence of the reinforcement sent to Argos; keeping on their right hand the city of the Stratians with their garrison, and on the left the rest of Acarnania.


3.106.2
2457
καὶ διελθόντες τὴν Στρατίων γῆν ἐχώρουν διὰ τῆς Φυτίας καὶ αὖθις Μεδεῶνος παρ’ ἔσχατα , ἔπειτα διὰ Λιμναίας ·
After passing the territory of the Stratians, they proceeded through Phytia, and again through Medeon, along the borders;


3.106.2
2458
καὶ ἐπέβησαν τῆς Ἀγραίων , οὐκέτι Ἀκαρνανίας , φιλίας δὲ σφίσιν .
then through Limnaea; and so they entered the territory of the Aegraeans, which formed no part of Acarnania, but was friendly to themselves.


3.106.3
2459
λαβόμενοι δὲ τοῦ Θυάμου ὄρους , ὅ ἐστιν Ἀγραϊκόν , ἐχώρουν δι’ αὐτοῦ καὶ κατέβησαν ἐς τὴν Ἀργείαν νυκτὸς ἤδη , καὶ διεξελθόντες μεταξὺ τῆς τε Ἀργείων πόλεως καὶ τῆς ἐπὶ Κρήναις Ἀκαρνάνων φυλακῆς ἔλαθον καὶ προσέμειξαν τοῖς ἐν Ὄλπαις Ἀμπρακιώταις .
Then, having reached Mount Thyamus, which is uncultivated, they proceeded across it, and so came down into the Argive country by night, and passing unobserved between the city of Argos and the Acarnanian posts at Crenae, joined the Ambraciots at Olpae.


3.107.1
2460
γενόμενοι δὲ ἁθρόοι ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ καθίζουσιν ἐπὶ τὴν Μητρόπολιν καλουμένην καὶ στρατόπεδον ἐποιήσαντο .
Having thus effected a union at day-break, they sat down at the place called Metropolis, and formed their encampment.


3.107.1
2461
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ταῖς εἴκοσι ναυσὶν οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον παραγίγνονται ἐς τὸν Ἀμπρακικὸν κόλπον βοηθοῦντες τοῖς Ἀργείοις , καὶ Δημοσθένης Μεσσηνίων μὲν ἔχων διακοσίους ὁπλίτας , ἑξήκοντα δὲ τοξότας Ἀθηναίων .
Not long after, the Athenians came with their twenty ships into the Ambracian Gulf to assist the Argives; and Demosthenes arrived with two hundred heavy-armed of the Messenians, and sixty Athenian archers.


3.107.2
2462
καὶ αἱ μὲν νῆες περὶ τὰς Ὄλπας τὸν λόφον ἐκ θαλάσσης ἐφώρμουν ·
The fleet therefore at Olpae blockaded the hill from the sea;


3.107.2
2463
οἱ δὲ Ἀκαρνᾶνες καὶ Ἀμφιλόχων ὀλίγοι ( οἱ γὰρ πλείους ὑπὸ Ἀμπρακιωτῶν βίᾳ κατείχοντο ) ἐς τὸ Ἄργος ἤδη ξυνεληλυθότες παρεσκευάζοντο ὡς μαχούμενοι τοῖς ἐναντίοις , καὶ ἡγεμόνα τοῦ παντὸς ξυμμαχικοῦ αἱροῦνται Δημοσθένη μετὰ τῶν σφετέρων στρατηγῶν .
while the Acarnanians and a few of the Amphilochians (for the majority were forcibly detained by the Ambraciots) had by this time met at Argos, and were preparing to engage with the enemy, having appointed Demosthenes as commander of the whole army in concert with their own generals.


3.107.3
2464
ὁ δὲ προσαγαγὼν ἐγγὺς τῆς Ὄλπης ἐστρατοπεδεύσατο , χαράδρα δ’ αὐτοὺς μεγάλη διεῖργεν .
He, having led them near to Olpae, encamped there;


3.107.3
2465
καὶ ἡμέρας μὲν πέντε ἡσύχαζον , τῇ δ’ ἕκτῃ ἐτάσσοντο ἀμφότεροι ὡς ἐς μάχην .
a great ravine separating their armies. For five days they remained still, but on the sixth both sides drew up for battle.


3.107.3
2466
καὶ ( μεῖζον γὰρ ἐγένετο καὶ περιέσχε τὸ τῶν Πελοποννησίων στρατόπεδον ) ὁ Δημοσθένης δείσας μὴ κυκλωθῇ λοχίζει ἐς ὁδόν τινα κοίλην καὶ λοχμώδη ὁπλίτας καὶ ψιλοὺς ξυναμφοτέρους ἐς τετρακοσίους , ὅπως κατὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῶν ἐναντίων ἐν τῇ ξυνόδῳ αὐτῇ ἐξαναστάντες οὗτοι κατὰ νώτου γίγνωνται .
And as the force of the Peloponnesians was the larger, and outflanked his, Demosthenes, fearing that he might be surrounded, placed in ambush in a hollow way covered with a thicket, a body of heavy and light-armed troops, four hundred in all, that on the flank of the enemy which reached beyond his own, these troops might rise up in the very midst of the conflict and take them in their rear.


3.107.4
2467
ἐπεὶ δὲ παρεσκεύαστο ἀμφοτέροις , ᾖσαν ἐς χεῖρας , Δημοσθένης μὲν τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας ἔχων μετὰ Μεσσηνίων καὶ Ἀθηναίων ὀλίγων , τὸ δὲ ἄλλο Ἀκαρνᾶνες ὡς ἕκαστοι τεταγμένοι ἐπεῖχον , καὶ Ἀμφιλόχων οἱ παρόντες ἀκοντισταί , Πελοποννήσιοι δὲ καὶ Ἀμπρακιῶται ἀναμὶξ τεταγμένοι πλὴν Μαντινέων ·
When the preparations were completed on both sides, they closed in battle. Demosthenes occupied the right wing with the Messenians and the few Athenians; while the remainder of the line was formed by the Acarnanians in their several divisions, and the Amphilochian dartmen that were present.


3.107.4
2468
οὗτοι δὲ ἐν τῷ εὐωνύμῳ μᾶλλον καὶ οὐ τὸ κέρας ἄκρον ἔχοντες ἁθρόοι ἦσαν , ἀλλ’ Εὐρύλοχος ἔσχατον εἶχε τὸ εὐώνυμον καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ , κατὰ Μεσσηνίους καὶ Δημοσθένη .
The Peloponnesians and Ambraciots were drawn up without distinction, excepting the Mantineans, who kept together more on the left, though not in the extremity of the flank, for the extreme left was held by Eurylochus and his men, opposed to the Messenians and Demosthenes.


3.108.1
2469
ὡς δ’ ἐν χερσὶν ἤδη ὄντες περιέσχον τῷ κέρᾳ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ ἐκυκλοῦντο τὸ δεξιὸν τῶν ἐναντίων , οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἐνέδρας Ἀκαρνᾶνες ἐπιγενόμενοι αὐτοῖς κατὰ νώτου προσπίπτουσί τε καὶ τρέπουσιν , ὥστε μήτε ἐς ἀλκὴν ὑπομεῖναι φοβηθέντας τε ἐς φυγὴν καὶ τὸ πλέον τοῦ στρατεύματος καταστῆσαι ·
When the Peloponnesians, being now engaged, outflanked their opponents, and were surrounding their right, the Acarnanians, rising from the ambuscade, fell on them in the rear, and broke them; so that they did not stand to make any resistance, and, moreover, by their panic threw their main army into flight:


3.108.1
2470
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ εἶδον τὸ κατ’ Εὐρύλοχον καὶ ὃ κράτιστον ἦν διαφθειρόμενον , πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐφοβοῦντο .
for when they saw the division of Eurylochus, and the bravest of their forces being cut to pieces, they were far more alarmed.


3.108.1
2471
καὶ οἱ Μεσσήνιοι ὄντες ταύτῃ μετὰ τοῦ Δημοσθένους τὸ πολὺ τοῦ ἔργου ἐπεξῆλθον .
It was the Messenians, posted in that part of the field with Demosthenes, that performed the chief part of the work.


3.108.2
2472
οἱ δὲ Ἀμπρακιῶται καὶ οἱ κατὰ τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας ἐνίκων τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς καὶ πρὸς τὸ Ἄργος ἀπεδίωξαν ·
But the Ambraciots and those in the right wing defeated the division opposed to them, and pursued it back to Argos;


3.108.2
2473
καὶ γὰρ μαχιμώτατοι τῶν περὶ ἐκεῖνα τὰ χωρία τυγχάνουσιν ὄντες .
for they are the most warlike of all in those parts.


3.108.3
2474
ἐπαναχωροῦντες δὲ ὡς ἑώρων τὸ πλέον νενικημένον καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἀκαρνᾶνες σφίσι προσέκειντο , χαλεπῶς διεσῴζοντο ἐς τὰς Ὄλπας , καὶ πολλοὶ ἀπέθανον αὐτῶν , ἀτάκτως καὶ οὐδενὶ κόσμῳ προσπίπτοντες πλὴν Μαντινέων ·
When, however, on their return they saw their main army defeated, and the rest of the Acarnanians were pressing them closely, they escaped with difficulty into Olpe;


3.108.3
2475
οὗτοι δὲ μάλιστα ξυντεταγμένοι παντὸς τοῦ στρατοῦ ἀνεχώρησαν .
and many of them were killed, while they hurried on without any order, excepting the Mantineans, who kept their ranks best of all the army during the retreat.


3.108.3
2476
καὶ ἡ μὲν μάχη ἐτελεύτα ἐς ὀψέ .
And so the battle ended, after lasting till evening.


3.109.1
2477
Μενεδάϊος δὲ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ Εὐρυλόχου τεθνεῶτος καὶ Μακαρίου αὐτὸς παρειληφὼς τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ ἀπορῶν μεγάλης ἥσσης γεγενημένης ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἢ μένων πολιορκήσεται ἔκ τε γῆς καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ταῖς Ἀττικαῖς ναυσὶν ἀποκεκλῃμένος ἢ καὶ ἀναχωρῶν διασωθήσεται , προσφέρει λόγον περὶ σπονδῶν καὶ ἀναχωρήσεως Δημοσθένει καὶ τοῖς Ἀκαρνάνων στρατηγοῖς , καὶ περὶ νεκρῶν ἅμα ἀναιρέσεως .
The next day Menedaeus, who on the death of Eurylochus and Macarius had succeeded to the sole command, was at a loss, since so great a defeat had been experienced, to see in what way he should either remain and sustain a siege—cut off as he was by land, and at the same time, through the presence of the Athenian fleet, by sea—or should escape if he retreated.


3.109.2
2478
οἱ δὲ νεκροὺς μὲν ἀπέδοσαν καὶ τροπαῖον αὐτοὶ ἔστησαν καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν τριακοσίους μάλιστα ἀποθανόντας ἀνείλοντο , ἀναχώρησιν δὲ ἐκ μὲν τοῦ προφανοῦς οὐκ ἐσπείσαντο ἅπασι , κρύφα δὲ Δημοσθένης μετὰ τῶν ξυστρατήγων Ἀκαρνάνων σπένδονται Μαντινεῦσι καὶ Μενεδαΐῳ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἄρχουσι τῶν Πελοποννησίων καὶ ὅσοι αὐτῶν ἦσαν ἀξιολογώτατοι ἀποχωρεῖν κατὰ τάχος , βουλόμενος ψιλῶσαι τοὺς Ἀμπρακιώτας τε καὶ τὸν μισθοφόρον ὄχλον τὸν ξενικόν , μάλιστα δὲ Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ Πελοποννησίους διαβαλεῖν ἐς τοὺς ἐκείνῃ χρῄζων Ἕλληνας ὡς καταπροδόντες τὸ ἑαυτῶν προυργιαίτερον ἐποιήσαντο .
He therefore made proposals to Demosthenes and the Acarnanians for a truce, and permission to retire, as well as for the recovery of his dead. They restored him his dead, and themselves erected a trophy, and took up their own dead, about three hundred in number; but for permission to retire they did not openly grant any truce to the whole army; but Demosthenes and his Acarnanian colleagues secretly granted one to the Mantineans, and Menedaeus and the other Peloponnesian commanders, to retreat with all speed; wishing to strip of their supporters the Ambraciots and the mercenary host of foreigners; but most of all desiring to raise a prejudice against the Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians amongst the Greeks in those parts, from the impression of their having betrayed their friends, and deemed their own interest of more importance.


3.109.3
2479
καὶ οἱ μὲν τούς τε νεκροὺς ἀνείλοντο καὶ διὰ τάχους ἔθαπτον , ὥσπερ ὑπῆρχε , καὶ τὴν ἀποχώρησιν κρύφα οἷς ἐδέδοτο ἐπεβούλευον ·
They, then, took up their dead, and were burying them with all speed, as circumstances allowed; while those who had received permission were planning their retreat.


3.110.1
2480
τῷ δὲ Δημοσθένει καὶ τοῖς Ἀκαρνᾶσιν ἀγγέλλεται τοὺς Ἀμπρακιώτας τοὺς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως πανδημεὶ κατὰ τὴν πρώτην ἐκ τῶν Ὀλπῶν ἀγγελίαν ἐπιβοηθεῖν διὰ τῶν Ἀμφιλόχων , βουλομένους τοῖς ἐν Ὄλπαις ξυμμεῖξαι , εἰδότας οὐδὲν τῶν γεγενημένων .
Now tidings were brought to Demosthenes and the Acarnanians, that the Ambraciots at home, in compliance with the first message from Olpae, were marching in full force with succours through Amphilochia, with a wish to join their countrymen at Olpae, and knowing nothing of what had happened.


3.110.2
2481
καὶ πέμπει εὐθὺς τοῦ στρατοῦ μέρος τι τὰς ὁδοὺς προλοχιοῦντας καὶ τὰ καρτερὰ προκαταληψομένους , καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ στρατιᾷ ἅμα παρεσκευάζετο βοηθεῖν ἐπ’ αὐτούς .
Accordingly he straightway sent a division to lay ambushes beforehand in the roads, and to preoccupy the strong positions; while with the rest of his army he prepared to march against them.


3.111.1
2482
ἐν τούτῳ δ’ οἱ Μαντινῆς καὶ οἷς ἔσπειστο πρόφασιν ἐπὶ λαχανισμὸν καὶ φρυγάνων ξυλλογὴν ἐξελθόντες ὑπαπῇσαν κατ’ ὀλίγους , ἅμα ξυλλέγοντες ἐφ’ ἃ ἐξῆλθον δῆθεν ·
Meanwhile the Mantineans, and those to whom the truce had been granted, going out under the pretext of gathering herbs and fire-wood, secretly went away in small parties, picking up at the same time the things for which they professed to have left the camp.


3.111.1
2483
προκεχωρηκότες δὲ ἤδη ἄπωθεν τῆς Ὄλπης θᾶσσον ἀπεχώρουν .
But when they had now proceeded some distance from Olpae, they began to retreat at a quicker pace.


3.111.2
2484
οἱ δ’ Ἀμπρακιῶται καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι , ὅσοι † μὲν ἐτύγχανον οὕτως † ἁθρόοι ξυνεξελθόντες , ὡς ἔγνωσαν ἀπιόντας , ὥρμησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ ἔθεον δρόμῳ , ἐπικαταλαβεῖν βουλόμενοι .
The Ambraciots and the rest, as many as happened thus to have gone out with them in a body, when they found that they were gone away, themselves also pushed forward, and began running, on purpose to overtake them.


3.111.3
2485
οἱ δὲ Ἀκαρνᾶνες τὸ μὲν πρῶτον καὶ πάντας ἐνόμισαν ἀπιέναι ἀσπόνδους ὁμοίως καὶ τοὺς Πελοποννησίους ἐπεδίωκον , καί τινας αὐτῶν τῶν στρατηγῶν κωλύοντας καὶ φάσκοντας ἐσπεῖσθαι αὐτοῖς ἠκόντισέ τις , νομίσας καταπροδίδοσθαι σφᾶς ·
But the Acarnanians at first thought that all alike were flying without permission, and began to pursue the Peloponnesians;


3.111.3
2486
ἔπειτα μέντοι τοὺς μὲν Μαντινέας καὶ τοὺς Πελοποννησίους ἀφίεσαν , τοὺς δ’ Ἀμπρακιώτας ἔκτεινον .
and when some even of their generals tried to stop them, and said that permission had been granted to the Peloponnesians, one or two men threw their darts at them, believing that they were being betrayed.


3.111.4
2487
καὶ ἦν πολλὴ ἔρις καὶ ἄγνοια εἴτε Ἀμπρακιώτης τίς ἐστιν εἴτε Πελοποννήσιος .
And there was much contention and difficulty in distinguishing whether a man was an Ambraciot or a Peloponnesian.


3.111.4
2488
καὶ ἐς διακοσίους μέν τινας αὐτῶν ἀπέκτειναν ·
They killed some two hundred of them;


3.111.4
2489
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι διέφυγον ἐς τὴν Ἀγραΐδα ὅμορον οὖσαν , καὶ Σαλύνθιος αὐτοὺς ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἀγραίων φίλος ὢν ὑπεδέξατο .
the rest escaped into Agraea, a bordering territory, and Salaethus, king of the Agraeans, being their friend, received them.


3.112.1
2490
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Ἀμπρακιῶται ἀφικνοῦνται ἐπ’ Ἰδομενήν .
The Ambraciots from the city arrived at Idomene.


3.112.1
2491
ἐστὸν δὲ δύο λόφω ἡ Ἰδομενὴ ὑψηλώ ·
This town consists of two high hills;


3.112.1
2492
τούτοιν τὸν μὲν μείζω νυκτὸς ἐπιγενομένης οἱ προαποσταλέντες ὑπὸ τοῦ Δημοσθένους ἀπὸ τοῦ στρατοπέδου ἔλαθόν τε καὶ ἔφθασαν προκαταλαβόντες ( τὸν δ’ ἐλάσσω ἔτυχον οἱ Ἀμπρακιῶται προαναβάντες ) καὶ ηὐλίσαντο .
the greater of which, after night had come on, the troops sent forward from the camp by Demosthenes preoccupied unobserved; while the Ambraciots had previously ascended the smaller, and bivouaeked on it.


3.112.2
2493
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης δειπνήσας ἐχώρει καὶ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα ἀπὸ ἑσπέρας εὐθύς , αὐτὸς μὲν τὸ ἥμισυ ἔχων ἐπὶ τῆς ἐσβολῆς , τὸ δ’ ἄλλο διὰ τῶν Ἀμφιλοχικῶν ὀρῶν .
himself with half of his force making for the pass, the remainder proceeding over the mountains of Amphilochia.


3.112.3
2494
καὶ ἅμα ὄρθρῳ ἐπιπίπτει τοῖς Ἀμπρακιώταις ἔτι ἐν ταῖς εὐναῖς καὶ οὐ προῃσθημένοις τὰ γεγενημένα , ἀλλὰ πολὺ μᾶλλον νομίσασι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν εἶναι ·
At dawn of day he fell upon the Ambraciots, while they were yet in their beds, and had had no notice of his measures, but much rather imagined that his forces were their own countrymen.


3.112.4
2495
καὶ γὰρ τοὺς Μεσσηνίους πρώτους ἐπίτηδες ὁ Δημοσθένης προύταξε καὶ προσαγορεύειν ἐκέλευε , Δωρίδα τε γλῶσσαν ἱέντας καὶ τοῖς προφύλαξι πίστιν παρεχομένους , ἅμα δὲ καὶ οὐ καθορωμένους τῇ ὄψει νυκτὸς ἔτι οὔσης .
For Demosthenes had purposely posted the Messenians first, with orders to address them, speaking in the Doric dialect, and so creating confidence in the sentinels; while at the same time they were not visible to the eye, as it was still night.


3.112.5
2496
ὡς οὖν ἐπέπεσε τῷ στρατεύματι αὐτῶν , τρέπουσι , καὶ τοὺς μὲν πολλοὺς αὐτοῦ διέφθειραν , οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ κατὰ τὰ ὄρη ἐς φυγὴν ὥρμησαν .
When therefore he fell upon them, they routed them, and slew the greater part on the spot; the rest rushed in flight over the mountains.


3.112.6
2497
προκατειλημμένων δὲ τῶν ὁδῶν , καὶ ἅμα τῶν μὲν Ἀμφιλόχων ἐμπείρων ὄντων τῆς ἑαυτῶν γῆς καὶ ψιλῶν πρὸς ὁπλίτας , τῶν δὲ ἀπείρων καὶ ἀνεπιστημόνων ὅπῃ τράπωνται , ἐσπίπτοντες ἔς τε χαράδρας καὶ τὰς προλελοχισμένας ἐνέδρας διεφθείροντο .
But as the roads were preoccupied, and the Amphilochians, moreover, were well acquainted with their own country, and light-armed against a heavy-armed enemy, whereas the Ambraciots were unacquainted with it, and knew not which way to turn, they perished by falling into ravines, and the ambushes that had been previously laid.


3.112.7
2498
καὶ ἐς πᾶσαν ἰδέαν χωρήσαντες τῆς φυγῆς ἐτράποντό τινες καὶ ἐς τὴν θάλασσαν οὐ πολὺ ἀπέχουσαν , καὶ ὡς εἶδον τὰς Ἀττικὰς ναῦς παραπλεούσας ἅμα τοῦ ἔργου τῇ ξυντυχίᾳ , προσένευσαν , ἡγησάμενοι ἐν τῷ αὐτίκα φόβῳ κρεῖσσον εἶναι σφίσιν ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν ταῖς ναυσίν , εἰ δεῖ , διαφθαρῆναι ἢ ὑπὸ τῶν βαρβάρων καὶ ἐχθίστων Ἀμφιλόχων .
After attempting every mode of escape, some of them also turned to the sea, which was not far off; and when they saw the Athenian ships coasting along shore at the time that the affair happened, they swam to them, in their present alarm thinking it better to be slain, if they must, by those on board, than by their barbarous and most bitter enemies, the Amphilochians.


3.112.8
2499
οἱ μὲν οὖν Ἀμπρακιῶται τοιούτῳ τρόπῳ κακωθέντες ὀλίγοι ἀπὸ πολλῶν ἐσώθησαν ἐς τὴν πόλιν ·
The Ambraciots then were destroyed in this manner, and only few of many escaped to their city.


3.112.8
2500
Ἀκαρνᾶνες δὲ σκυλεύσαντες τοὺς νεκροὺς καὶ τροπαῖα στήσαντες ἀπεχώρησαν ἐς Ἄργος .
The Acarnanians, after stripping the dead, and erecting trophies, returned to Argos.


3.113.1
2501
καὶ αὐτοῖς τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ἦλθε κῆρυξ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐς Ἀγραίους καταφυγόντων ἐκ τῆς Ὄλπης Ἀμπρακιωτῶν , ἀναίρεσιν αἰτήσων τῶν νεκρῶν οὓς ἀπέκτειναν ὕστερον τῆς πρώτης μάχης , ὅτε μετὰ τῶν Μαντινέων καὶ τῶν ὑποσπόνδων ξυνεξῇσαν ἄσπονδοι .
The next day there came to them a herald from the Ambraciots who had fled from Olpae into Agraea, to ask permission to take up the dead whom they had slain after the first engagement, when they left the camp without permission with the Mantineans and those who had received it.


3.113.2
2502
ἰδὼν δ’ ὁ κῆρυξ τὰ ὅπλα τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως Ἀμπρακιωτῶν ἐθαύμαζε τὸ πλῆθος ·
At sight of the arms taken from the Ambraciots from the city, the herald was astonished at their number;


3.113.2
2503
οὐ γὰρ ᾔδει τὸ πάθος , ἀλλ’ ᾤετο τῶν μετὰ σφῶν εἶναι .
for he was not acquainted with the disaster, but imagined that they had belonged to their own party.


3.113.3
2504
καί τις αὐτὸν ἤρετο ὅτι θαυμάζοι καὶ ὁπόσοι αὐτῶν τεθνᾶσιν , οἰόμενος αὖ ὁ ἐρωτῶν εἶναι τὸν κήρυκα ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν Ἰδομεναῖς .
And some one asked him why he was so astonished; and how many of them had been killed;


3.113.3
2505
ὁ δ’ ἔφη διακοσίους μάλιστα .
his interrogator again supposing him to be the herald from the troops at Idomene.


3.113.3
2506
ὑπολαβὼν δ’ ὁ ἐρωτῶν εἶπεν &quot; οὔκουν τὰ ὅπλα ταυτὶ φαίνεται , ἀλλὰ πλέον ἢ χιλίων &quot; .
He said, "About two hundred." His interrogator, taking him up, said, "These then are evidently not the arms [of such a number], but of more than a thousand."


3.113.4
2507
αὖθις δὲ εἶπεν ἐκεῖνος &quot; οὐκ ἄρα τῶν μεθ’ ἡμῶν μαχομένων ἐστίν &quot; .
The herald said in reply, "Then they are not the arms of those who fought with us."


3.113.4
2508
ὁ δ’ ἀπεκρίνατο &quot; εἴπερ γε ὑμεῖς ἐν Ἰδομενῇ χθὲς ἐμάχεσθε &quot; .
He answered, "Yes, they are; if at least it was you that fought yesterday at Idomene."


3.113.4
2509
&quot; ἀλλ’ ἡμεῖς γε οὐδενὶ ἐμαχόμεθα χθές , ἀλλὰ πρῴην ἐν τῇ ἀποχωρήσει &quot; .
"We fought with no one yesterday; but the day before, on our retreat."


3.113.4
2510
&quot; καὶ μὲν δὴ τούτοις γε ἡμεῖς χθὲς ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως βοηθήσασι τῆς Ἀμπρακιωτῶν ἐμαχόμεθα &quot; .
"Ay, but we fought yesterday with these, who had come as a reinforcement from the city of the Ambraciots."


3.113.5
2511
ὁ δὲ κῆρυξ ὡς ἤκουσε καὶ ἔγνω ὅτι ἡ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως βοήθεια διέφθαρται , ἀνοιμώξας καὶ ἐκπλαγεὶς τῷ μεγέθει τῶν παρόντων κακῶν ἀπῆλθεν εὐθὺς ἄπρακτος καὶ οὐκέτι ἀπῄτει τοὺς νεκρούς .
When the herald heard that, and learned that the reinforcement from the city had been cut off, breaking out into wailing, and astounded at the magnitude of the present evils, he returned without executing his commission, and no longer asked back the bodies.


3.113.6
2512
πάθος γὰρ τοῦτο μιᾷ πόλει Ἑλληνίδι ἐν ἴσαις ἡμέραις μέγιστον δὴ τῶν κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον τόνδε ἐγένετο .
For this was the greatest disaster that befell any one Grecian city in an equal number of days during the course of this war:


3.113.6
2513
καὶ ἀριθμὸν οὐκ ἔγραψα τῶν ἀποθανόντων , διότι ἄπιστον τὸ πλῆθος λέγεται ἀπολέσθαι ὡς πρὸς τὸ μέγεθος τῆς πόλεως .
and I have not recorded the numbers of the slain, because the multitude said to have fallen is incredible, in comparison with the size of the city.


3.113.6
2514
Ἀμπρακίαν μέντοι οἶδα ὅτι , εἰ ἐβουλήθησαν Ἀκαρνᾶνες καὶ Ἀμφίλοχοι Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Δημοσθένει πειθόμενοι ἐξελεῖν , αὐτοβοεὶ ἂν εἷλον ·
I know, however, that if the Acarnanians and Amphilochians had wished, in compliance with the advice of Demosthenes, to take Ambracia, they would have done so on the first assault:


3.113.6
2515
νῦν δ’ ἔδεισαν μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔχοντες αὐτὴν χαλεπώτεροι σφίσι πάροικοι ὦσιν .
but as it was, they were afraid that the Athenians, if they had possession of it, might prove more troublesome neighbours to themselves.


3.114.1
2516
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα τρίτον μέρος νείμαντες τῶν σκύλων τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τὰ ἄλλα κατὰ τὰς πόλεις διείλοντο .
After this, they allotted a third of the spoils to the Athenians, and divided the rest amongst their several cities.


3.114.1
2517
καὶ τὰ μὲν τῶν Ἀθηναίων πλέοντα ἑάλω , τὰ δὲ νῦν ἀνακείμενα ἐν τοῖς Ἀττικοῖς ἱεροῖς Δημοσθένει ἐξῃρέθησαν τριακόσιαι πανοπλίαι , καὶ ἄγων αὐτὰς κατέπλευσεν ·
Those given to the Athenians were taken while on their voyage home; and what are now deposited in the temples of Attica, are three hundred full suits of armour, which were reserved for Demosthenes, and with which he sailed back home;


3.114.1
2518
καὶ ἐγένετο ἅμα αὐτῷ μετὰ τὴν ἐκ τῆς Αἰτωλίας ξυμφορὰν ἀπὸ ταύτης τῆς πράξεως ἀδεεστέρα ἡ κάθοδος .
his restoration after the disaster in Aetolia being rendered more safe in consequence of this achievement.


3.114.2
2519
ἀπῆλθον δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐν ταῖς εἴκοσι ναυσὶν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς Ναύπακτον .
The Athenians on board the twenty ships also returned to Naupactus.


3.114.2
2520
Ἀκαρνᾶνες δὲ καὶ Ἀμφίλοχοι ἀπελθόντων Ἀθηναίων καὶ Δημοσθένους τοῖς ὡς Σαλύνθιον καὶ Ἀγραίους καταφυγοῦσιν Ἀμπρακιώταις καὶ Πελοποννησίοις ἀναχώρησιν ἐσπείσαντο ἐξ Οἰνιαδῶν , οἷπερ καὶ μετανέστησαν παρὰ Σαλυνθίου .
The Acarnanians and Amphilochians, on the departure of the Athenians and of Demosthenes, granted a truce to the Ambraciots and Peloponnesians who had taken refuge with Salynthus and the Agraeans, to return from Oeniadae, whither they had removed from the country of Acarnania.


3.114.3
2521
καὶ ἐς τὸν ἔπειτα χρόνον σπονδὰς καὶ ξυμμαχίαν ἐποιήσαντο ἑκατὸν ἔτη Ἀκαρνᾶνες καὶ Ἀμφίλοχοι πρὸς Ἀμπρακιώτας ἐπὶ τοῖσδε , ὥστε μήτε Ἀμπρακιώτας μετὰ Ἀκαρνάνων στρατεύειν ἐπὶ Πελοποννησίους μήτε Ἀκαρνᾶνας μετὰ Ἀμπρακιωτῶν ἐπ’ Ἀθηναίους , βοηθεῖν δὲ τῇ ἀλλήλων , καὶ ἀποδοῦναι Ἀμπρακιώτας ὁπόσα ἢ χωρία ἢ ὁμήρους Ἀμφιλόχων ἔχουσι , καὶ ἐπὶ Ἀνακτόριον μὴ βοηθεῖν πολέμιον ὂν Ἀκαρνᾶσιν .
Salynthus. And to provide for the future, they also concluded a treaty and alliance for a hundred years with the Ambraciots, on these conditions: that neither the Ambraciots should march with the Acarnanians against the Peloponnesians, nor the Acarnanians with the Ambraciots against the Athenians; but that they should succour each other's country; and that the Ambraciots should restore whatever towns or hostages they held from the Amphilochians, and not go to the assistance of Anactorium, which was hostile to the


3.114.4
2522
ταῦτα ξυνθέμενοι διέλυσαν τὸν πόλεμον .
Having made these arrangements, they put an end to the war.


3.114.4
2523
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα Κορίνθιοι φυλακὴν ἑαυτῶν ἐς τὴν Ἀμπρακίαν ἀπέστειλαν ἐς τριακοσίους ὁπλίτας καὶ Ξενοκλείδαν τὸν Εὐθυκλέους ἄρχοντα ·
Afterwards the Corinthians sent a garrison of their own citizens to Ambracia, consisting of three hundred heavy-armed, under the command of Xenoclides son of Euthycles,


3.114.4
2524
οἳ κομιζόμενοι χαλεπῶς διὰ τῆς ἠπείρου ἀφίκοντο .
who reached their destination by a difficult route through Epirus.


3.114.4
2525
τὰ μὲν κατ’ Ἀμπρακίαν οὕτως ἐγένετο .
Such was the conclusion of the measures in Ambracia.


3.115.1
2526
οἱ δ’ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος ἔς τε τὴν Ἱμεραίαν ἀπόβασιν ἐποιήσαντο ἐκ τῶν νεῶν μετὰ τῶν Σικελῶν τῶν ἄνωθεν ἐσβεβληκότων ἐς τὰ ἔσχατα τῆς Ἱμεραίας , καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς Αἰόλου νήσους ἔπλευσαν .
The Athenians in Sicily the same winter made a descent from their ships on the territory of Himera, in concert with the Sicels, who had made an irruption on its borders from the interior; they also sailed against the islands of Aeolus.


3.115.2
2527
ἀναχωρήσαντες δὲ ἐς Ῥήγιον Πυθόδωρον τὸν Ἰσολόχου Ἀθηναίων στρατηγὸν καταλαμβάνουσιν ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς διάδοχον ὧν ὁ Λάχης ἦρχεν .
On their return to Rhegium they found that Pythodorus son of Isolochus, a general of the Athenians, had come to succeed to the command of the ships under Laches;


3.115.3
2528
οἱ γὰρ ἐν Σικελίᾳ ξύμμαχοι πλεύσαντες ἔπεισαν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους βοηθεῖν σφίσι πλείοσι ναυσίν ·
the allies in Sicily having sailed and persuaded the Athenians to assist them with more vessels.


3.115.3
2529
τῆς μὲν γὰρ γῆς αὐτῶν οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐκράτουν , τῆς δὲ θαλάσσης ὀλίγαις ναυσὶν εἰργόμενοι παρεσκευάζοντο ναυτικὸν ξυναγείροντες ὡς οὐ περιοψόμενοι .
For though the Syracusans commanded their land, yet, as they were excluded from the sea by only a few ships, they were making preparations, and raising a fleet, with a determination not to put up with it.


3.115.4
2530
καὶ ἐπλήρουν ναῦς τεσσαράκοντα οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὡς ἀποστελοῦντες αὐτοῖς , ἅμα μὲν ἡγούμενοι θᾶσσον τὸν ἐκεῖ πόλεμον καταλυθήσεσθαι , ἅμα δὲ βουλόμενοι μελέτην τοῦ ναυτικοῦ ποιεῖσθαι .
And the Athenians manned forty ships to send to them; thinking that so the war in that quarter would be more speedily brought to a conclusion, and at the same time wishing to practise their men in seamanship.


3.115.5
2531
τὸν μὲν οὖν ἕνα τῶν στρατηγῶν ἀπέστειλαν Πυθόδωρον ὀλίγαις ναυσί , Σοφοκλέα δὲ τὸν Σωστρατίδου καὶ Εὐρυμέδοντα τὸν Θουκλέους ἐπὶ τῶν πλειόνων νεῶν ἀποπέμψειν ἔμελλον .
They despatched therefore one of their commanders, Pythodorus, with a few ships; intending to send out Sophocles son of Sostradides, and Eurymedon son of Thucles, with the larger squadron.


3.115.6
2532
ὁ δὲ Πυθόδωρος ἤδη ἔχων τὴν τοῦ Λάχητος τῶν νεῶν ἀρχὴν ἔπλευσε τελευτῶντος τοῦ χειμῶνος ἐπὶ τὸ Λοκρῶν φρούριον ὃ πρότερον Λάχης εἷλε , καὶ νικηθεὶς μάχῃ ὑπὸ τῶν Λοκρῶν ἀπεχώρησεν .
So Pythodorus, being now in command of Laches' ships, sailed at the close of the winter to the fort of the Locrians, which Laches had formerly taken; and returned after being defeated in battle by the Locrians.


3.116.1
2533
ἐρρύη δὲ περὶ αὐτὸ τὸ ἔαρ τοῦτο ὁ ῥύαξ τοῦ πυρὸς ἐκ τῆς Αἴτνης , ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον , καὶ γῆν τινὰ ἔφθειρε τῶν Καταναίων , οἳ ὑπὸ τῇ Αἴτνῃ τῷ ὄρει οἰκοῦσιν , ὅπερ μέγιστόν ἐστιν ὄρος ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ .
Just about the beginning of this spring, the fire flood issued from Aetna, as it had done on former occasions, and destroyed some of the territory of the Catanaeans, who live on Mount Etna, the largest mountain in Sicily.


3.116.2
2534
λέγεται δὲ πεντηκοστῷ ἔτει ῥυῆναι τοῦτο μετὰ τὸ πρότερον ῥεῦμα , τὸ δὲ ξύμπαν τρὶς γεγενῆσθαι τὸ ῥεῦμα ἀφ’ οὗ Σικελία ὑπὸ Ἑλλήνων οἰκεῖται .
It is said that this eruption took place fifty years after the preceding one; and that it has occurred three times in all since Sicily has been inhabited by the Greeks.


3.116.3
2535
ταῦτα μὲν κατὰ τὸν χειμῶνα τοῦτον ἐγένετο , καὶ ἕκτον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
These were the events of this winter; and so ended the sixth year of this war, of which Thucydides wrote the history.



4.1.1
2536
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους περὶ σίτου ἐκβολὴν Συρακοσίων δέκα νῆες πλεύσασαι καὶ Λοκρίδες ἴσαι Μεσσήνην τὴν ἐν Σικελίᾳ κατέλαβον , αὐτῶν ἐπαγαγομένων , καὶ ἀπέστη Μεσσήνη Ἀθηναίων .
THE following summer, about the time of the corn's coming into ear, ten Syracusan ships and an equal number of Locrians sailed and occupied Messana in Sicily, at the invitation of the inhabitants; and so Messana revolted from the Athenians.


4.1.2
2537
ἔπραξαν δὲ τοῦτο μάλιστα οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι ὁρῶντες προσβολὴν ἔχον τὸ χωρίον τῆς Σικελίας καὶ φοβούμενοι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μὴ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ὁρμώμενοί ποτε σφίσι μείζονι παρασκευῇ ἐπέλθωσιν , οἱ δὲ Λοκροὶ κατὰ ἔχθος τὸ Ῥηγίνων , βουλόμενοι ἀμφοτέρωθεν αὐτοὺς καταπολεμεῖν .
This was chiefly done, by the Syracusans, because they saw that the place afforded an approach to Sicily, and were afraid that the Athenians might hereafter make it their head-quarters and proceed against them with a larger force; by the Locrians, for hatred of the people of Rhegium, and with a wish to reduce them by hostilities on both sides.


4.1.3
2538
καὶ ἐσεβεβλήκεσαν ἅμα ἐς τὴν Ῥηγίνων οἱ Λοκροὶ πανστρατιᾷ , ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβοηθῶσι τοῖς Μεσσηνίοις , ἅμα δὲ καὶ ξυνεπαγόντων Ῥηγίνων φυγάδων , οἳ ἦσαν παρ’ αὐτοῖς ·
At the same time too the Locrians had invaded the territory of Rhegium with all their forces, to prevent their going to the rescue of Messana, and also at the instigation of some exiles from Rhegium who were with them.


4.1.3
2539
τὸ γὰρ Ῥήγιον ἐπὶ πολὺν χρόνον ἐστασίαζε καὶ ἀδύνατα ἦν ἐν τῷ παρόντι τοὺς Λοκροὺς ἀμύνεσθαι , ᾗ καὶ μᾶλλον ἐπετίθεντο .
For that town had been for a long time torn by faction, and it was impossible at the present time to resist the Locrians; for which reason they were the more determined to attack them.


4.1.4
2540
δῃώσαντες δὲ οἱ μὲν Λοκροὶ τῷ πεζῷ ἀπεχώρησαν , αἱ δὲ νῆες Μεσσήνην ἐφρούρουν ·
After devastating the country, the Locrians retired with their land-forces, but their ships remained to guard Messana;


4.1.4
2541
καὶ ἄλλαι αἱ πληρούμεναι ἔμελλον αὐτόσε ἐγκαθορμισάμεναι τὸν πόλεμον ἐντεῦθεν ποιήσεσθαι .
and others that were being manned were to go to that station, and carry on the war from it.


4.2.1
2542
ὑπὸ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τοῦ ἦρος , πρὶν τὸν σῖτον ἐν ἀκμῇ εἶναι , Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐσέβαλον ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν ( ἡγεῖτο δὲ Ἆγις ὁ Ἀρχιδάμου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς ) , καὶ ἐγκαθεζόμενοι ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν .
About the same period of the spring, before the corn was ripe, the Peloponnesians and their allies made an incursion into Attica, under the conduct of Agis son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians; and pitching their camp in the country, proceeded to lay it waste.


4.2.2
2543
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ τάς τε τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς ἐς Σικελίαν ἀπέστειλαν , ὥσπερ παρεσκευάζοντο , καὶ στρατηγοὺς τοὺς ὑπολοίπους Εὐρυμέδοντα καὶ Σοφοκλέα ·
But the Athenians despatched the forty ships to Sicily, as they had been preparing to do, and the remaining generals, Eurymedon and Sophocles;


4.2.2
2544
Πυθόδωρος γὰρ ὁ τρίτος αὐτῶν ἤδη προαφῖκτο ἐς Σικελίαν .
for Pythodorus, the third of them, had already arrived in Sicily before them.


4.2.3
2545
εἶπον δὲ τούτοις καὶ Κερκυραίων ἅμα παραπλέοντας τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐπιμεληθῆναι , οἳ ἐλῃστεύοντο ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν τῷ ὄρει φυγάδων ·
These they also ordered to attend, as they sailed by the island, to those of the Corcyraeans who were in the city, and who were being plundered by the exiles on the mountain;


4.2.3
2546
καὶ Πελοποννησίων αὐτόσε νῆες ἑξήκοντα παρεπεπλεύκεσαν τοῖς ἐν τῷ ὄρει τιμωροὶ καὶ λιμοῦ ὄντος μεγάλου ἐν τῇ πόλει νομίζοντες κατασχήσειν ῥᾳδίως τὰ πράγματα .
sixty ships having likewise sailed from the Peloponnese to assist those on the mountain, and with an idea, that as there was a great famine in the city, they should easily possess themselves of the government.


4.2.4
2547
Δημοσθένει δὲ ὄντι ἰδιώτῃ μετὰ τὴν ἀναχώρησιν τὴν ἐξ Ἀκαρνανίας αὐτῷ δεηθέντι εἶπον χρῆσθαι ταῖς ναυσὶ ταύταις , ἢν βούληται , περὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον .
Demosthenes, who had continued in a private capacity since his return from Acarnania, was, at his own request, authorized by them to use that fleet, if he wished, for service about the Peloponnese.


4.3.1
2548
καὶ ὡς ἐγένοντο πλέοντες κατὰ τὴν Λακωνικὴν καὶ ἐπυνθάνοντο ὅτι αἱ νῆες ἐν Κερκύρᾳ ἤδη εἰσὶ τῶν Πελοποννησίων , ὁ μὲν Εὐρυμέδων καὶ Σοφοκλῆς ἠπείγοντο ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν , ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης ἐς τὴν Πύλον πρῶτον ἐκέλευε σχόντας αὐτοὺς καὶ πράξαντας ἃ δεῖ τὸν πλοῦν ποιεῖσθαι ·
When, on their voyage, they were off Laconia, and heard that the Peloponnesian ships were already at Corcyra, Eurymedon and Sophocles were for hastening thither, but Demosthenes desired them to touch first at Pylus, and after doing what was necessary, then to proceed on their voyage.


4.3.1
2549
ἀντιλεγόντων δὲ κατὰ τύχην χειμὼν ἐπιγενόμενος κατήνεγκε τὰς ναῦς ἐς τὴν Πύλον .
While they were making objections, a storm happened to come on, and carried the fleet to Pylus.


4.3.2
2550
καὶ ὁ Δημοσθένης εὐθὺς ἠξίου τειχίζεσθαι τὸ χωρίον ( ἐπὶ τοῦτο γὰρ ξυνεκπλεῦσαι ) , καὶ ἀπέφαινε πολλὴν εὐπορίαν ξύλων τε καὶ λίθων , καὶ φύσει καρτερὸν ὂν καὶ ἐρῆμον αὐτό τε καὶ ἐπὶ πολὺ τῆς χώρας ·
So Demosthenes immediately begged them to fortify the place, (for this, he said, was his object in sailing with them,) and showed them that there was great abundance of timber and stone, and that the post was a strong one, and unoccupied, both itself and a considerable distance of the country round.


4.3.2
2551
ἀπέχει γὰρ σταδίους μάλιστα ἡ Πύλος τῆς Σπάρτης τετρακοσίους καὶ ἔστιν ἐν τῇ Μεσσηνίᾳ ποτὲ οὔσῃ γῇ , καλοῦσι δὲ αὐτὴν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι Κορυφάσιον .
For Pylus is about four hundred stades from Sparta, and is situated in what was once the Messenian territory, being called by the Lacedaemonians Coryphasium.


4.3.3
2552
οἱ δὲ πολλὰς ἔφασαν εἶναι ἄκρας ἐρήμους τῆς Πελοποννήσου , ἢν βούληται καταλαμβάνων τὴν πόλιν δαπανᾶν .
But the commanders said that there were many unoccupied promontories in the Peloponnese, if he wished to put the state to expense by occupying them.


4.3.3
2553
τῷ δὲ διάφορόν τι ἐδόκει εἶναι τοῦτο τὸ χωρίον ἑτέρου μᾶλλον , λιμένος τε προσόντος καὶ τοὺς Μεσσηνίους οἰκείους ὄντας αὐτῷ τὸ ἀρχαῖον καὶ ὁμοφώνους τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις πλεῖστ’ ἂν βλάπτειν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ὁρμωμένους , καὶ βεβαίους ἅμα τοῦ χωρίου φύλακας ἔσεσθαι .
He, however, considered that this was a more advantageous post than any other, inasmuch as there was a harbour close by, and the Messenians, who in early times were connected with the place, and spoke the same dialect with the Lacedaemonians, would do them very great injury by their excursions from it, and at the same time be trusty guardians of the place.


4.4.1
2554
ὡς δὲ οὐκ ἔπειθεν οὔτε τοὺς στρατηγοὺς οὔτε τοὺς στρατιώτας , ὕστερον καὶ τοῖς ταξιάρχοις κοινώσας , ἡσύχαζεν ὑπὸ ἀπλοίας , μέχρι αὐτοῖς τοῖς στρατιώταις σχολάζουσιν ὁρμὴ ἐνέπεσε περιστᾶσιν ἐκτειχίσαι τὸ χωρίον .
When he could not convince either the generals or the soldiers, having subsequently communicated his views to the subordinate officers also, he remained quiet from stress of weather; till the soldiers themselves, in their want of occupation, were seized with a desire to set to and fortify the post.


4.4.2
2555
καὶ ἐγχειρήσαντες εἰργάζοντο , σιδήρια μὲν λιθουργὰ οὐκ ἔχοντες , λογάδην δὲ φέροντες λίθους , καὶ ξυνετίθεσαν ὡς ἕκαστόν τι ξυμβαίνοι ·
Accordingly they took the work in hand, and proceeded with it, though they had no iron tools, but carried stones just as they picked them up, and put them together, as they severally might happen to fit;


4.4.2
2556
καὶ τὸν πηλόν , εἴ που δέοι χρῆσθαι , ἀγγείων ἀπορίᾳ ἐπὶ τοῦ νώτου ἔφερον , ἐγκεκυφότες τε , ὡς μάλιστα μέλλοι ἐπιμένειν , καὶ τὼ χεῖρε ἐς τ- ὀπίσω ξυμπλέκοντες , ὅπως μὴ ἀποπίπτοι .
while the mortar, wherever it was necessary to use any, for want of hods they carried on their back, stooping down in such a way that it might best he on, and clasping their hands behind them, to prevent its falling off.


4.4.3
2557
παντί τε τρόπῳ ἠπείγοντο φθῆναι τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους τὰ ἐπιμαχώτατα ἐξεργασάμενοι πρὶν ἐπιβοηθῆσαι ·
Indeed in every way they made haste to anticipate the Lacedaemonians, by completing the most assailable points of the work before they came to the rescue;


4.4.3
2558
τὸ γὰρ πλέον τοῦ χωρίου αὐτὸ καρτερὸν ὑπῆρχε καὶ οὐδὲν ἔδει τείχους .
for the greater part of the position was strong by nature, and had no need of fortifications.


4.5.1
2559
οἱ δὲ ἑορτήν τινα ἔτυχον ἄγοντες καὶ ἅμα πυνθανόμενοι ἐν ὀλιγωρίᾳ ἐποιοῦντο , ὡς , ὅταν ἐξέλθωσιν , ἢ οὐχ ὑπομενοῦντας σφᾶς ἢ ῥᾳδίως ληψόμενοι βίᾳ ·
Now the Lacedaemonians happened to be celebrating a festival; and, moreover, when they heard it, they made light of it, thinking that when they took the field, either the enemy would not wait their attack, or they should easily take the place by storm.


4.5.1
2560
καί τι καὶ αὐτοὺς ὁ στρατὸς ἔτι ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις ὢν ἐπέσχεν .
To a certain extent also the fact of their army being still before Athens delayed them.


4.5.2
2561
τειχίσαντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῦ χωρίου τὰ πρὸς ἤπειρον καὶ ἃ μάλιστα ἔδει ἐν ἡμέραις ἓξ τὸν μὲν Δημοσθένη μετὰ νεῶν πέντε αὐτοῦ φύλακα καταλείπουσι , ταῖς δὲ πλείοσι ναυσὶ τὸν ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν πλοῦν καὶ Σικελίαν ἠπείγοντο .
So the Athenians, after fortifying in six days the side towards the interior, and what most required it, left Demosthenes there with five ships to protect the place, while with the main body of the fleet they hastened on their voyage to Corcyra and Sicily.


4.6.1
2562
οἱ δ’ ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ὄντες Πελοποννήσιοι ὡς ἐπύθοντο τῆς Πύλου κατειλημμένης , ἀνεχώρουν κατὰ τάχος ἐπ’ οἴκου , νομίζοντες μὲν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ Ἆγις ὁ βασιλεὺς οἰκεῖον σφίσι τὸ περὶ τὴν Πύλον ·
When the Peloponnesians in Attica heard of the occupation of Pylus, they returned home with all speed;


4.6.1
2563
ἅμα δὲ πρῲ ἐσβαλόντες καὶ τοῦ σίτου ἔτι χλωροῦ ὄντος ἐσπάνιζον τροφῆς τοῖς πολλοῖς , χειμών τε ἐπιγενόμενος μείζων παρὰ τὴν καθεστηκυῖαν ὥραν ἐπίεσε τὸ στράτευμα .
for the Lacedaemonians and Agis their king thought that the affair of Pylus closely affected them; and, besides, having made their incursion early in the season, and while the corn was still green, they were in want of provisions for most of their troops; while stormy weather, coming on with greater violence than was usual at that season, distressed the army.


4.6.2
2564
ὥστε πολλαχόθεν ξυνέβη ἀναχωρῆσαί τε θᾶσσον αὐτοὺς καὶ βραχυτάτην γενέσθαι τὴν ἐσβολὴν ταύτην ·
So that for many reasons it happened that they returned quicker than usual, and that this was the shortest incursion they had made;


4.6.2
2565
ἡμέρας γὰρ πέντε καὶ δέκα ἔμειναν ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ .
for they remained in Attica but fifteen days.


4.7.1
2566
κατὰ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον Σιμωνίδης Ἀθηναίων στρατηγὸς Ἠιόνα τὴν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης Μενδαίων ἀποικίαν , πολεμίαν δὲ οὖσαν , ξυλλέξας Ἀθηναίους τε ὀλίγους ἐκ τῶν φρουρίων καὶ τῶν ἐκείνῃ ξυμμάχων πλῆθος προδιδομένην κατέλαβεν .
At this same period, Simonides, an Athenian commander, having got together a few Athenians from the guard-stations, and a large body of the allies in that neighbourhood, took possession of Eion in Thrace, a colony from Mende, and hostile [to Athens], which was betrayed to him.


4.7.1
2567
καὶ παραχρῆμα ἐπιβοηθησάντων Χαλκιδέων καὶ Βοττιαίων ἐξεκρούσθη τε καὶ ἀπέβαλε πολλοὺς τῶν στρατιωτῶν .
But the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans having immediately come to its rescue, he was beaten out of it, and lost many of his soldiers.


4.8.1
2568
ἀναχωρησάντων δὲ τῶν ἐκ τῆς Ἀττικῆς Πελοποννησίων οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται αὐτοὶ μὲν καὶ οἱ ἐγγύτατα τῶν περιοίκων εὐθὺς ἐβοήθουν ἐπὶ τὴν Πύλον , τῶν δὲ ἄλλων Λακεδαιμονίων βραδυτέρα ἐγίγνετο ἡ ἔφοδος , ἄρτι ἀφιγμένων ἀφ’ ἑτέρας στρατείας .
On the return of the Peloponnesians from Attica, the Spartans themselves and the nearest of the  immediately went to the rescue of Pylus; but the other Lacedaemonians were more slow in marching against it, as they had but just reached home from a different expedition.


4.8.2
2569
περιήγγελλον δὲ καὶ κατὰ τὴν Πελοπόννησον βοηθεῖν ὅτι τάχιστα ἐπὶ Πύλον καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς ἐν τῇ Κερκύρᾳ ναῦς σφῶν τὰς ἑξήκοντα ἔπεμψαν , αἳ ὑπερενεχθεῖσαι τὸν Λευκαδίων ἰσθμὸν καὶ λαθοῦσαι τὰς ἐν Ζακύνθῳ Ἀττικὰς ναῦς ἀφικνοῦνται ἐπὶ Πύλον ·
They despatched orders also through the rest of the Peloponnese to bring up their reinforcements to Pylus as quickly as possible and sent for their sixty ships at Corcyra.


4.8.2
2570
παρῆν δὲ ἤδη καὶ ὁ πεζὸς στρατός .
These having been hauled over the isthmus of Leucas, and having so escaped the observation of the Athenian fleet at Zacynthus, reached Pylus; the land-forces also having by that time arrived.


4.8.3
2571
Δημοσθένης δὲ προσπλεόντων ἔτι τῶν Πελοποννησίων ὑπεκπέμπει φθάσας δύο ναῦς ἀγγεῖλαι Εὐρυμέδοντι καὶ τοῖς ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐν Ζακύνθῳ Ἀθηναίοις παρεῖναι ὡς τοῦ χωρίου κινδυνεύοντος .
While the Peloponnesians were yet sailing up, Demosthenes anticipated them by secretly sending two ships with a message to Eurymedon and the Athenians on board the fleet at Zacynthus to join him, as the place was in danger.


4.8.4
2572
καὶ αἱ μὲν νῆες κατὰ τάχος ἔπλεον κατὰ τὰ ἐπεσταλμένα ὑπὸ Δημοσθένους ·
So the ships sailed with all speed, according to the orders of Demosthenes;


4.8.4
2573
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι παρεσκευάζοντο ὡς τῷ τειχίσματι προσβαλοῦντες κατά τε γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν , ἐλπίζοντες ῥᾳδίως αἱρήσειν οἰκοδόμημα διὰ ταχέων εἰργασμένον καὶ ἀνθρώπων ὀλίγων ἐνόντων .
while the Lacedaemonians prepared to assault the place both by land and sea, hoping easily to take a building completed in haste, and with only a few men in it.


4.8.5
2574
προσδεχόμενοι δὲ καὶ τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς Ζακύνθου τῶν Ἀττικῶν νεῶν βοήθειαν ἐν νῷ εἶχον , ἢν ἄρα μὴ πρότερον ἕλωσι , καὶ τοὺς ἔσπλους τοῦ λιμένος ἐμφάρξαι , ὅπως μὴ ᾖ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐφορμίσασθαι ἐς αὐτόν .
At the same time, expecting the arrival of the Athenian fleet from Zacynthus to its relief, they intended, in case of their not having taken it before, to bar also the entrances into the harbour, that the Athenians might not be able to come to anchor in it.


4.8.6
2575
ἡ γὰρ νῆσος ἡ Σφακτηρία καλουμένη τόν τε λιμένα παρατείνουσα καὶ ἐγγὺς ἐπικειμένη ἐχυρὸν ποιεῖ καὶ τοὺς ἔσπλους στενούς , τῇ μὲν δυοῖν νεοῖν διάπλουν κατὰ τὸ τείχισμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τὴν Πύλον , τῇ δὲ πρὸς τὴν ἄλλην ἤπειρον ὀκτὼ ἢ ἐννέα ·
For the island that is called Sphacteria both secures the harbour, by stretching in a line with it, and close off it, and narrows its entrances; on one side, near the Athenian fortifications and Pylus, leaving a passage for two ships; on the other, towards the rest of the mainland, for eight or nine.


4.8.6
2576
ὑλώδης τε καὶ ἀτριβὴς πᾶσα ὑπ’ ἐρημίας ἦν καὶ μέγεθος περὶ πέντε καὶ δέκα σταδίους μάλιστα .
It was all woody and pathless from its desert condition, and in extent about fifteen stades. The entrances then they intended to bar with a close line of vessels, with their heads looking outwards;


4.8.7
2577
τοὺς μὲν οὖν ἔσπλους ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀντιπρῴροις βύζην κλῄσειν ἔμελλον ·
while fearing this island, lest the enemy should carry on their operations against them from it, they conveyed over some heavy-armed troops into it,


4.8.7
2578
τὴν δὲ νῆσον ταύτην φοβούμενοι μὴ ἐξ αὐτῆς τὸν πόλεμον σφίσι ποιῶνται , ὁπλίτας διεβίβασαν ἐς αὐτὴν καὶ παρὰ τὴν ἤπειρον ἄλλους ἔταξαν .
and posted others along the mainland.


4.8.8
2579
οὕτω γὰρ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τήν τε νῆσον πολεμίαν ἔσεσθαι τήν τε ἤπειρον , ἀπόβασιν οὐκ ἔχουσαν ( τὰ γὰρ αὐτῆς τῆς Πύλου ἔξω τοῦ ἔσπλου πρὸς τὸ πέλαγος ἀλίμενα ὄντα οὐχ ἕξειν ὅθεν ὁρμώμενοι ὠφελήσουσι τοὺς αὑτῶν ) σφεῖς δὲ ἄνευ τε ναυμαχίας καὶ κινδύνου ἐκπολιορκήσειν τὸ χωρίον κατὰ τὸ εἰκός , σίτου τε οὐκ ἐνόντος καὶ δι’ ὀλίγης παρασκευῆς κατειλημμένον .
For so they thought that both the island would be unfavourable to the Athenians, and the mainland also, as it did not afford any landing-place; for the shores of Pylus itself outside the inlet, looking towards the open sea, would present no ground from which they might proceed to the aid of their countrymen; and so they should storm the place, in all probability, without the risk of a sea-fight, as there were no provisions in it, and it had been occupied after short preparation.


4.8.9
2580
ὡς δ’ ἐδόκει αὐτοῖς ταῦτα , καὶ διεβίβαζον ἐς τὴν νῆσον τοὺς ὁπλίτας ἀποκληρώσαντες ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν λόχων .
Having adopted these resolutions, accordingly they conveyed over the heavy-armed into the island, drafting them by lot from all the There had also been some others sent over before in turns;


4.8.9
2581
καὶ διέβησαν μὲν καὶ ἄλλοι πρότερον κατὰ διαδοχήν , οἱ δὲ τελευταῖοι καὶ ἐγκαταληφθέντες εἴκοσι καὶ τετρακόσιοι ἦσαν καὶ Εἵλωτες οἱ περὶ αὐτούς ·
but these last who went, and who were left there, were four hundred and twenty in number, with their attendant Helots;


4.8.9
2582
ἦρχε δὲ αὐτῶν Ἐπιτάδας ὁ Μολόβρου .
their commander being Epitadas son of Molobrus.


4.9.1
2583
Δημοσθένης δὲ ὁρῶν τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους μέλλοντας προσβάλλειν ναυσί τε ἅμα καὶ πεζῷ παρεσκευάζετο καὶ αὐτός , καὶ τὰς τριήρεις αἳ περιῆσαν αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῶν καταλειφθεισῶν ἀνασπάσας ὑπὸ τὸ τείχισμα προσεσταύρωσε , καὶ τοὺς ναύτας ἐξ αὐτῶν ὥπλισεν ἀσπίσι τε φαύλαις καὶ οἰσυΐναις ταῖς πολλαῖς ·
Demosthenes, seeing the Lacedaemonians about to attack him both by sea and land at once, made his own preparations also; and having drawn up under the fortifications the triremes he had remaining from those that had been left him, he enclosed them in a stockade, and armed the crews taken out of them with shields of an inferior kind, and in most cases made of osiers.


4.9.1
2584
οὐ γὰρ ἦν ὅπλα ἐν χωρίῳ ἐρήμῳ πορίσασθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ ταῦτα ἐκ λῃστρικῆς Μεσσηνίων τριακοντόρου καὶ κέλητος ἔλαβον , οἳ ἔτυχον παραγενόμενοι .
For it was not possible in so lonely a place to provide themselves with arms; but even these they had got from a thirty-oared privateer and skiff belonging to some Messenians, who happened to have come to them.


4.9.1
2585
ὁπλῖταί τε τῶν Μεσσηνίων τούτων ὡς τεσσαράκοντα ἐγένοντο , οἷς ἐχρῆτο μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων .
Of these Messenians there were also about forty heavy-armed, whose services he used with the rest.


4.9.2
2586
τοὺς μὲν οὖν πολλοὺς τῶν τε ἀόπλων καὶ ὡπλισμένων ἐπὶ τὰ τετειχισμένα μάλιστα καὶ ἐχυρὰ τοῦ χωρίου πρὸς τὴν ἤπειρον ἔταξε , προειπὼν ἀμύνασθαι τὸν πεζόν , ἢν προσβάλῃ ·
The main body, both of the unarmed and the armed, he posted at the most fortified and secure points of the place, facing the interior, with orders to repel the land-forces, should they make an assault;


4.9.2
2587
αὐτὸς δὲ ἀπολεξάμενος ἐκ πάντων ἑξήκοντα ὁπλίτας καὶ τοξότας ὀλίγους ἐχώρει ἔξω τοῦ τείχους ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν , ᾗ μάλιστα ἐκείνους προσεδέχετο πειράσειν ἀποβαίνειν , ἐς χωρία μὲν χαλεπὰ καὶ πετρώδη πρὸς τὸ πέλαγος τετραμμένα , σφίσι δὲ τοῦ τείχους ταύτῃ ἀσθενεστάτου ὄντος ἐσβιάσασθαι αὐτοὺς ἡγεῖτο προθυμήσεσθαι ·
while he himself, having picked from the whole force sixty heavy-armed and a few bowmen, proceeded outside the wall to the sea, where he most expected that they would attempt a landing, on ground which was difficult, indeed, and rocky, looking as it did to the open sea, but still, as their wall was weakest at that point, he thought that this would tempt them to be eager in attacking it.


4.9.3
2588
οὔτε γὰρ αὐτοὶ ἐλπίζοντές ποτε ναυσὶ κρατήσεσθαι οὐκ ἰσχυρὸν ἐτείχιζον , ἐκείνοις τε βιαζομένοις τὴν ἀπόβασιν ἁλώσιμον τὸ χωρίον γίγνεσθαι .
For they built it of no great strength just there, expecting never to be beaten at sea themselves; and also thinking that if the enemy once forced a landing, the place then became easy to take.


4.9.4
2589
κατὰ τοῦτο οὖν πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν θάλασσαν χωρήσας ἔταξε τοὺς ὁπλίτας ὡς εἴρξων , ἢν δύνηται , καὶ παρεκελεύσατο τοιάδε .
At this point then he went down to the very sea, and posted his heavy-armed, to prevent a landing, if possible; while he encouraged them with these words:


4.10.1
2590
&quot; ἄνδρες οἱ ξυναράμενοι τοῦδε τοῦ κινδύνου , μηδεὶς ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ τοιᾷδε ἀνάγκῃ ξυνετὸς βουλέσθω δοκεῖν εἶναι , ἐκλογιζόμενος ἅπαν τὸ περιεστὸς ἡμᾶς δεινόν , μᾶλλον ἢ ἀπερισκέπτως εὔελπις ὁμόσε χωρῆσαι τοῖς ἐναντίοις καὶ ἐκ τούτων ἂν περιγενόμενος .
" Soldiers, who have shared with me this adventure, let none of you in such an emergency wish to show himself clever by calculating the whole amount of the danger that surrounds us, but rather to charge the enemy with reckless confidence, and with the probability of escaping by these means.


4.10.1
2591
ὅσα γὰρ ἐς ἀνάγκην ἀφῖκται ὥσπερ τάδε , λογισμὸν ἥκιστα ἐνδεχόμενα κινδύνου τοῦ ταχίστου προσδεῖται .
For circumstances which are as pressing as ours by no means admit of calculation, but require the danger to be faced as quickly as possible."


4.10.2
2592
ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ τὰ πλείω ὁρῶ πρὸς ἡμῶν ὄντα , ἢν ἐθέλωμέν τε μεῖναι καὶ μὴ τῷ πλήθει αὐτῶν καταπλαγέντες τὰ ὑπάρχοντα ἡμῖν κρείσσω καταπροδοῦναι .
" But indeed I see the greater part of them favourable to us, if we will but stand our ground, and not, through being alarmed at the enemy's numbers, throw away the advantages we have. For the difficulty of landing which the place presents I consider to be in our favour:"


4.10.3
2593
τοῦ τε γὰρ χωρίου τὸ δυσέμβατον ἡμέτερον νομίζω , ὃ μενόντων μὲν ἡμῶν ξύμμαχον γίγνεται , ὑποχωρήσασι δὲ καίπερ χαλεπὸν ὂν εὔπορον ἔσται μηδενὸς κωλύοντος , καὶ τὸν πολέμιον δεινότερον ἕξομεν μὴ ῥᾳδίας αὐτῷ πάλιν οὔσης τῆς ἀναχωρήσεως , ἢν καὶ ὑφ’ ἡμῶν βιάζηται ( ἐπὶ γὰρ ταῖς ναυσὶ ῥᾷστοί εἰσιν ἀμύνεσθαι , ἀποβάντες δὲ ἐν τῷ ἴσῳ ἤδη ) , τό τε πλῆθος αὐτῶν οὐκ ἄγαν δεῖ φοβεῖσθαι ·
" for while we remain where we are, this assists us in the struggle; but if we retreat, we shall find that though [naturally] difficult, it will be easy when there is no one to offer resistance. And in that case we shall find the enemy the more formidable on this very account, because his retreat will not be easily effected, even though he may be driven back by us. For while on board their ships, they are most easy to repel; but when they have once landed, they are then on equal terms with us."


4.10.4
2594
κατ’ ὀλίγον γὰρ μαχεῖται καίπερ πολὺ ὂν ἀπορίᾳ τῆς προσορμίσεως , καὶ οὐκ ἐν γῇ στρατός ἐστιν ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου μείζων , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ νεῶν , αἷς πολλὰ τὰ καίρια δεῖ ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ξυμβῆναι .
" Nor should you be very much alarmed at their numbers; for though great, they will engage in small detachments, through the impossibility of bringing to: and it is not an army on the land, fighting on equal ground, while superior in numbers; but one on board a fleet, for which, when at sea, many lucky chances are required [to make it effective]. So that I consider their difficulties a fair equivalent for our numbers;"


4.10.5
2595
ὥστε τὰς τούτων ἀπορίας ἀντιπάλους ἡγοῦμαι τῷ ἡμετέρῳ πλήθει , καὶ ἅμα ἀξιῶ ὑμᾶς , Ἀθηναίους ὄντας καὶ ἐπισταμένους ἐμπειρίᾳ τὴν ναυτικὴν ἐπ’ ἄλλους ἀπόβασιν ὅτι , εἴ τις ὑπομένοι καὶ μὴ φόβῳ ῥοθίου καὶ νεῶν δεινότητος κατάπλου ὑποχωροίη , οὐκ ἄν ποτε βιάζοιτο , καὶ αὐτοὺς νῦν μεῖναί τε καὶ ἀμυνομένους παρ’ αὐτὴν τὴν ῥαχίαν σῴζειν ἡμᾶς τε αὐτοὺς καὶ τὸ χωρίον &quot; .
" and at the same time I call on you, Athenians as you are, and knowing from experience as you do the nature of a naval descent on the coast of others, namely, that if a man should stand his ground, and not retreat for fear of the roaring surf and the terrors of the ships sailing to shore, he would never be driven back; [I call on you, I say,] now in your own case to stand your ground, and by resisting them along the very beach to save both yourselves and the place."


4.11.1
2596
τοσαῦτα τοῦ Δημοσθένους παρακελευσαμένου οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐθάρσησάν τε μᾶλλον καὶ ἐπικαταβάντες ἐτάξαντο παρ’ αὐτὴν τὴν θάλασσαν .
When Demosthenes had thus encouraged them, they were more inspirited, and went down against them, and ranged themselves close along the sea.


4.11.2
2597
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἄραντες τῷ τε κατὰ γῆν στρατῷ προσέβαλλον τῷ τειχίσματι καὶ ταῖς ναυσὶν ἅμα οὔσαις τεσσαράκοντα καὶ τρισί , ναύαρχος δὲ αὐτῶν ἐπέπλει Θρασυμηλίδας ὁ Κρατησικλέους Σπαρτιάτης .
The Lacedaemonians, moved from their position, and assaulted the fort at the same time both with their army by land and with their ships, of which there were forty-three; the admiral on board being Thrasymelidas son of Cratesicles, a Spartan.


4.11.2
2598
προσέβαλλε δὲ ᾗπερ ὁ Δημοσθένης προσεδέχετο .
And he assaulted it just where Demosthenes was expecting him.


4.11.3
2599
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἔκ τε γῆς καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ἠμύνοντο ·
So the Athenians defended themselves on both sides, landward and seaward;


4.11.3
2600
οἱ δὲ κατ’ ὀλίγας ναῦς διελόμενοι , διότι οὐκ ἦν πλέοσι προσσχεῖν , καὶ ἀναπαύοντες ἐν τῷ μέρει τοὺς ἐπίπλους ἐποιοῦντο , προθυμίᾳ τε πάσῃ χρώμενοι καὶ παρακελευσμῷ , εἴ πως ὠσάμενοι ἕλοιεν τὸ τείχισμα .
while their opponents, divided into detachments of a few ships, because it was not possible for more to bring to, and relieving each other in turn, were sailing up against them with all eagerness and mutual exhortation, if by any means they might force their passage and take the place.


4.11.4
2601
πάντων δὲ φανερώτατος Βρασίδας ἐγένετο .
The most distinguished of all, however, was Brasidas.


4.11.4
2602
τριηραρχῶν γὰρ καὶ ὁρῶν τοῦ χωρίου χαλεποῦ ὄντος τοὺς τριηράρχους καὶ κυβερνήτας , εἴ που καὶ δοκοίη δυνατὸν εἶναι σχεῖν , ἀποκνοῦντας καὶ φυλασσομένους τῶν νεῶν μὴ ξυντρίψωσιν , ἐβόα λέγων ὡς οὐκ εἰκὸς εἴη ξύλων φειδομένους τοὺς πολεμίους ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ περιιδεῖν τεῖχος πεποιημένους , ἀλλὰ τάς τε σφετέρας ναῦς βιαζομένους τὴν ἀπόβασιν καταγνύναι ἐκέλευε , καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους μὴ ἀποκνῆσαι ἀντὶ μεγάλων εὐεργεσιῶν τὰς ναῦς τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἐπιδοῦναι , ὀκείλαντας δὲ καὶ παντὶ τρόπῳ ἀποβάντας τῶν τε ἀνδρῶν καὶ τοῦ χωρίου κρατῆσαι .
For being captain of a trireme, and seeing that, in consequence of the difficulty of the position, the captains and steersmen, even where it did seem possible to land, shrunk back and were cautious of wrecking their vessels, he shouted out, and said, that it was not right to be chary of timbers, and put up with the enemy's having built a fort in their country; but he bade them shiver their vessels to force a landing, and told the allies not to shrink, in return for great benefits received, to sacrifice their ships for the Lacedaemonians on the present occasion, but to run them ashore, and land by any means, and secure both the men and the place.


4.12.1
2603
καὶ ὁ μὲν τούς τε ἄλλους τοιαῦτα ἐπέσπερχε καὶ τὸν ἑαυτοῦ κυβερνήτην ἀναγκάσας ὀκεῖλαι τὴν ναῦν ἐχώρει ἐπὶ τὴν ἀποβάθραν ·
In this way he urged on the rest, and having compelled his own steersman to run the ship ashore, he stepped on the gang-board, and was endeavouring to land when he was cut down by the Athenians, and fainted away after receiving many wounds.


4.12.1
2604
καὶ πειρώμενος ἀποβαίνειν ἀνεκόπη ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καὶ τραυματισθεὶς πολλὰ ἐλιποψύχησέ τε καὶ πεσόντος αὐτοῦ ἐς τὴν παρεξειρεσίαν ἡ ἀσπὶς περιερρύη ἐς τὴν θάλασσαν , καὶ ἐξενεχθείσης αὐτῆς ἐς τὴν γῆν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀνελόμενοι ὕστερον πρὸς τὸ τροπαῖον ἐχρήσαντο ὃ ἔστησαν τῆς προσβολῆς ταύτης .
Having fallen into the ship's bows, his shield slipped from around his arm into the sea; and on its being thrown ashore, the Athenians picked it up, and afterwards used it for the trophy which they erected for this attack.


4.12.2
2605
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι προυθυμοῦντο μέν , ἀδύνατοι δ’ ἦσαν ἀποβῆναι τῶν τε χωρίων χαλεπότητι καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων μενόντων καὶ οὐδὲν ὑποχωρούντων .
The rest were eager to land, but unable, both from the difficulty of the ground and from the Athenians standing firm and not giving way.


4.12.3
2606
ἐς τοῦτό τε περιέστη ἡ τύχη ὥστε Ἀθηναίους μὲν ἐκ γῆς τε καὶ ταύτης Λακωνικῆς ἀμύνεσθαι ἐκείνους ἐπιπλέοντας , Λακεδαιμονίους δὲ ἐκ νεῶν τε καὶ ἐς τὴν ἑαυτῶν πολεμίαν οὖσαν ἐπ’ Ἀθηναίους ἀποβαίνειν ·
And such was the revolution of fortune, that Athenians fighting from land, and that a part of Laconia, were repelling Lacedaemonians when sailing against them; while Lacedaemonians were landing from ships, and on their own country, now hostile to them, to attack Athenians.


4.12.3
2607
ἐπὶ πολὺ γὰρ ἐποίει τῆς δόξης ἐν τῷ τότε τοῖς μὲν ἠπειρώταις μάλιστα εἶναι καὶ τὰ πεζὰ κρατίστοις , τοῖς δὲ θαλασσίοις τε καὶ ταῖς ναυσὶ πλεῖστον προύχειν .
[I call it a revolution of fortune,] for it formed at that time the main glory of the Lacedaemonians, that they were an inland people, and most powerful by land; and of the Athenians, that they were a maritime people, and had by far the most powerful navy.


4.13.1
2608
ταύτην μὲν οὖν τὴν ἡμέραν καὶ τῆς ὑστεραίας μέρος τι προσβολὰς ποιησάμενοι ἐπέπαυντο ·
Having then made their attacks during that day and part of the following, they ceased from them,


4.13.1
2609
καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἐπὶ ξύλα ἐς μηχανὰς παρέπεμψαν τῶν νεῶν τινὰς ἐς Ἀσίνην , ἐλπίζοντες τὸ κατὰ τὸν λιμένα τεῖχος ὕψος μὲν ἔχειν , ἀποβάσεως δὲ μάλιστα οὔσης ἑλεῖν ἂν μηχαναῖς .
and on the third sent some of their ships to Asine, to fetch timber for the construction of their engines; hoping that though the wall opposite the harbour was high, yet as the landing was most practicable there, they would take it by means of engines.


4.13.2
2610
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ αἱ ἐκ τῆς Ζακύνθου νῆες τῶν Ἀθηναίων παραγίγνονται τεσσαράκοντα ·
Meanwhile the Athenian ships from Zacynthus arrived, fifty in number;


4.13.2
2611
προσεβοήθησαν γὰρ τῶν τε φρουρίδων τινὲς αὐτοῖς τῶν ἐκ Ναυπάκτου καὶ Χῖαι τέσσαρες .
for they were reinforced by some of the guard-ships at Naupactus, and four Chians.


4.13.3
2612
ὡς δὲ εἶδον τήν τε ἤπειρον ὁπλιτῶν περίπλεων τήν τε νῆσον , ἔν τε τῷ λιμένι οὔσας τὰς ναῦς καὶ οὐκ ἐκπλεούσας , ἀπορήσαντες ὅπῃ καθορμίσωνται , τότε μὲν ἐς Πρωτὴν τὴν νῆσον , ἣ οὐ πολὺ ἀπέχει ἐρῆμος οὖσα , ἔπλευσαν καὶ ηὐλίσαντο , τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ παρασκευασάμενοι ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίαν ἀνήγοντο , ἢν μὲν ἀντεκπλεῖν ἐθέλωσι σφίσιν ἐς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν , εἰ δὲ μή , ὡς αὐτοὶ ἐπεσπλευσούμενοι .
When they saw both the mainland and the island crowded with heavy-armed, and the ships in the harbour, and not sailing out of it; being at a loss where to get anchorage, they sailed at the time to the island of Prote, which is not far off, and is uninhabited, and there they passed the night. The next day they weighed anchor in readiness for an engagement in the open sea, should the enemy be disposed to put out to meet them there; if not, intending to sail in and attack them.


4.13.4
2613
καὶ οἱ μὲν οὔτε ἀντανήγοντο οὔτε ἃ διενοήθησαν , φάρξαι τοὺς ἔσπλους , ἔτυχον ποιήσαντες , ἡσυχάζοντες δ’ ἐν τῇ γῇ τάς τε ναῦς ἐπλήρουν καὶ παρεσκευάζοντο , ἢν ἐσπλέῃ τις , ὡς ἐν τῷ λιμένι ὄντι οὐ σμικρῷ ναυμαχήσοντες .
They, however, neither put out to meet them, nor had done what they had intended, viz. to bar the entrances; but remaining quiet on shore, were manning their ships, and preparing, in case of any one's sailing in, to engage in the harbour, which is of no small extent.


4.14.1
2614
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι γνόντες καθ’ ἑκάτερον τὸν ἔσπλουν ὥρμησαν ἐπ’ αὐτούς , καὶ τὰς μὲν πλείους καὶ μετεώρους ἤδη τῶν νεῶν καὶ ἀντιπρῴρους προσπεσόντες ἐς φυγὴν κατέστησαν , καὶ ἐπιδιώκοντες ὡς διὰ βραχέος ἔτρωσαν μὲν πολλάς , πέντε δὲ ἔλαβον , καὶ μίαν τούτων αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσιν ·
The Athenians, on perceiving this, advanced against them by each entrance; and finding most of their ships already afloat and drawn up to meet them, they attacked and put them to flight, and chasing them as well as the short distance permitted, disabled many, and took five, one of them with its crew;


4.14.1
2615
ταῖς δὲ λοιπαῖς ἐν τῇ γῇ καταπεφευγυίαις ἐνέβαλλον .
while the rest they charged after they had taken refuge under the land.


4.14.1
2616
αἱ δὲ καὶ πληρούμεναι ἔτι πρὶν ἀνάγεσθαι ἐκόπτοντο ·
Some too were battered while still being manned, before they got under weigh;


4.14.1
2617
καί τινας καὶ ἀναδούμενοι κενὰς εἷλκον τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐς φυγὴν ὡρμημένων .
while others they lashed to their own, and began to tow off empty, the crews having taken to flight.


4.14.2
2618
ἃ ὁρῶντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ περιαλγοῦντες τῷ πάθει , ὅτιπερ αὐτῶν οἱ ἄνδρες ἀπελαμβάνοντο ἐν τῇ νήσῳ , παρεβοήθουν , καὶ ἐπεσβαίνοντες ἐς τὴν θάλασσαν ξὺν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἀνθεῖλκον ἐπιλαμβανόμενοι τῶν νεῶν ·
The Lacedaemonians seeing this, and being exceedingly distressed at the disaster, because their men were being intercepted on the island, went to the rescue, and rushing into the sea with their arms, laid hold of the vessels, and began to pull them back again;


4.14.2
2619
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ κεκωλῦσθαι ἐδόκει ἕκαστος ᾧ μή τινι καὶ αὐτὸς ἔργῳ παρῆν .
every one thinking the business to be obstructed in that part in which he was not himself engaged.


4.14.3
2620
ἐγένετό τε ὁ θόρυβος μέγας καὶ ἀντηλλαγμένου τοῦ ἑκατέρων τρόπου περὶ τὰς ναῦς ·
Thus the uproar occasioned was great, and the very reverse of what was habitual to both parties with regard to ships:


4.14.3
2621
οἵ τε γὰρ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ὑπὸ προθυμίας καὶ ἐκπλήξεως ὡς εἰπεῖν ἄλλο οὐδὲν ἢ ἐκ γῆς ἐναυμάχουν , οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι κρατοῦντες καὶ βουλόμενοι τῇ παρούσῃ τύχῃ ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐπεξελθεῖν ἀπὸ νεῶν ἐπεζομάχουν .
for the Lacedaemonians, in their eagerness and dismay, were absolutely engaged in a sea-fight, so to speak, from the land; and the Athenians, victorious as they were, and wishing to follow up their present success as far as possible, were engaged in a land-fight from their vessels.


4.14.4
2622
πολύν τε πόνον παρασχόντες ἀλλήλοις καὶ τραυματίσαντες διεκρίθησαν , καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὰς κενὰς ναῦς πλὴν τῶν τὸ πρῶτον ληφθεισῶν διέσωσαν .
After inflicting much labour and many wounds on each other, they separated;


4.14.5
2623
καταστάντες δὲ ἑκάτεροι ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον οἱ μὲν τροπαῖόν τε ἔστησαν καὶ νεκροὺς ἀπέδοσαν καὶ ναυαγίων ἐκράτησαν , καὶ τὴν νῆσον εὐθὺς περιέπλεον καὶ ἐν φυλακῇ εἶχον ὡς τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἀπειλημμένων ·
Both sides having returned to their encampment, the Athenians erected a trophy, gave back the slain, secured the wrecks, and immediately began to cruise round the island, and guarded it vigilantly, considering the men as intercepted;


4.14.5
2624
οἱ δ’ ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων ἤδη βεβοηθηκότες ἔμενον κατὰ χώραν ἐπὶ τῇ Πύλῳ .
while the Peloponnesians on the mainland, who had by this time come with their contingents from all the cities, remained stationary at Pylus.


4.15.1
2625
ἐς δὲ τὴν Σπάρτην ὡς ἠγγέλθη τὰ γεγενημένα περὶ Πύλον , ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς ὡς ἐπὶ ξυμφορᾷ μεγάλῃ τὰ τέλη καταβάντας ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον βουλεύειν παραχρῆμα ὁρῶντας ὅτι ἂν δοκῇ .
When tidings of what had taken place at Pylus reached Sparta, it was determined that, in so great a calamity, the authorities should go down to the camp, and immediately decide on inspection what they thought best.


4.15.2
2626
καὶ ὡς εἶδον ἀδύνατον ὂν τιμωρεῖν τοῖς ἀνδράσι καὶ κινδυνεύειν οὐκ ἐβούλοντο ἢ ὑπὸ λιμοῦ τι παθεῖν αὐτοὺς ἢ ὑπὸ πλήθους βιασθέντας κρατηθῆναι , ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς πρὸς τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ἢν ἐθέλωσι , σπονδὰς ποιησαμένους τὰ περὶ Πύλον ἀποστεῖλαι ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας πρέσβεις περὶ ξυμβάσεως καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ὡς τάχιστα πειρᾶσθαι κομίσασθαι .
They, seeing that it was impossible to assist their men, and not wishing to run the risk of their perishing by starvation, or being overpowered and taken by superior numbers, determined to conclude with the Athenian generals, if they were willing, an armistice concerning matters at Pylus, and then send ambassadors to Athens on the subject of a convention, and to try to recover their men as quickly as possible.


4.16.1
2627
δεξαμένων δὲ τῶν στρατηγῶν τὸν λόγον ἐγίγνοντο σπονδαὶ τοιαίδε , Λακεδαιμονίους μὲν τὰς ναῦς ἐν αἷς ἐναυμάχησαν καὶ τὰς ἐν τῇ Λακωνικῇ πάσας , ὅσαι ἦσαν μακραί , παραδοῦναι κομίσαντας ἐς Πύλον Ἀθηναίοις , καὶ ὅπλα μὴ ἐπιφέρειν τῷ τειχίσματι μήτε κατὰ γῆν μήτε κατὰ θάλασσαν , Ἀθηναίους δὲ τοῖς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ἀνδράσι σῖτον ἐᾶν τοὺς ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ Λακεδαιμονίους ἐκπέμπειν τακτὸν καὶ μεμαγμένον , δύο χοίνικας ἑκάστῳ Ἀττικὰς ἀλφίτων καὶ δύο κοτύλας οἴνου καὶ κρέας , θεράποντι δὲ τούτων ἡμίσεα ·
The generals having acceded to their proposal, an armistice was concluded on the following terms: "That the Lacedaemonians should bring to Pylus, and deliver up to the Athenians, the ships with which they had fought the battle, and all in Laconia that were vessels of war; and should make no attack on the fort, either by land or sea.


4.16.1
2628
ταῦτα δὲ ὁρώντων τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐσπέμπειν καὶ πλοῖον μηδὲν ἐσπλεῖν λάθρᾳ ·
That the Athenians should allow the Lacedaemonians on the mainland to send over to their men in the island a stipulated quantity of corn, ready-kneaded, viz. two Attic choenixes of barley-meal a man, with two cotylae of wine and a piece of flesh; and half that quantity for each attendant.


4.16.1
2629
φυλάσσειν δὲ καὶ τὴν νῆσον Ἀθηναίους μηδὲν ἧσσον , ὅσα μὴ ἀποβαίνοντας , καὶ ὅπλα μὴ ἐπιφέρειν τῷ Πελοποννησίων στρατῷ μήτε κατὰ γῆν μήτε κατὰ θάλασσαν .
That they should send in these rations under the eyes of the Athenians, and that no vessel should sail in by stealth. That the Athenians should keep guard over the island, nevertheless, so long as they did not land on it, and should abstain from attacking the forces of the Peloponnesians, either by land or by sea."


4.16.2
2630
ὅτι δ’ ἂν τούτων παραβαίνωσιν ἑκάτεροι καὶ ὁτιοῦν , τότε λελύσθαι τὰς σπονδάς .
"That if either party should break any of these terms, in any particular whatever, the armistice should at once be void.


4.16.2
2631
ἐσπεῖσθαι δὲ αὐτὰς μέχρι οὗ ἐπανέλθωσιν οἱ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν Λακεδαιμονίων πρέσβεις ·
That it should be in force till the Lacedaemonian ambassadors returned from Athens,


4.16.2
2632
ἀποστεῖλαι δὲ αὐτοὺς τριήρει Ἀθηναίους καὶ πάλιν κομίσαι .
the Athenians conveying them thither in a trireme, and bringing them back again.


4.16.2
2633
ἐλθόντων δὲ τάς τε σπονδὰς λελύσθαι ταύτας καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἀποδοῦναι Ἀθηναίους ὁμοίας οἵασπερ ἂν παραλάβωσιν .
That on their arrival this armistice should be void, and the Athenians should deliver back the ships, in the same condition as they had received them."


4.16.3
2634
αἱ μὲν σπονδαὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις ἐγένοντο , καὶ αἱ νῆες παρεδόθησαν οὖσαι περὶ ἑξήκοντα , καὶ οἱ πρέσβεις ἀπεστάλησαν .
The armistice was concluded on these terms; and accordingly the ships, amounting to about sixty, were given up, and the ambassadors despatched;


4.16.3
2635
ἀφικόμενοι δὲ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἔλεξαν τοιάδε .
who, on their arrival at Athens, spoke as follows:


4.17.1
2636
&quot; ἔπεμψαν ἡμᾶς Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , περὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ἀνδρῶν πράξοντας ὅτι ἂν ὑμῖν τε ὠφέλιμον ὂν τὸ αὐτὸ πείθωμεν καὶ ἡμῖν ἐς τὴν ξυμφορὰν ὡς ἐκ τῶν παρόντων κόσμον μάλιστα μέλλῃ οἴσειν .
"Athenians, the Lacedaemonians have sent us to effect, in behalf of our men in the island, whatever arrangement we may prove to be most advantageous for you, while at the same time it would be most creditable for us with regard to our misfortune, as far as present circumstances allow.


4.17.2
2637
τοὺς δὲ λόγους μακροτέρους οὐ παρὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς μηκυνοῦμεν , ἀλλ’ ἐπιχώριον ὂν ἡμῖν οὗ μὲν βραχεῖς ἀρκῶσι μὴ πολλοῖς χρῆσθαι , πλέοσι δὲ ἐν ᾧ ἂν καιρὸς ᾖ διδάσκοντάς τι τῶν προύργου λόγοις τὸ δέον πράσσειν .
Nor will it be contrary to our habit that we shall address you at some length; but it is the fashion of our country, where few words are sufficient, not to use many; but to use more than ordinary, when there is occasion for proving by words a point of importance to us, and so effecting our purpose.


4.17.3
2638
λάβετε δὲ αὐτοὺς μὴ πολεμίως μηδ’ ὡς ἀξύνετοι διδασκόμενοι , ὑπόμνησιν δὲ τοῦ καλῶς βουλεύσασθαι πρὸς εἰδότας ἡγησάμενοι .
Receive then what we say, not in a hostile spirit, nor as though you were considered ignorant and were being instructed by us;


4.17.4
2639
&quot; ὑμῖν γὰρ εὐτυχίαν τὴν παροῦσαν ἔξεστι καλῶς θέσθαι , ἔχουσι μὲν ὧν κρατεῖτε , προσλαβοῦσι δὲ τιμὴν καὶ δόξαν , καὶ μὴ παθεῖν ὅπερ οἱ ἀήθως τι ἀγαθὸν λαμβάνοντες τῶν ἀνθρώπων ·
"but rather regarding it as an admonition to take good advice, offered to men who are well informed. For it is in your power honourably to secure your present good fortune, keeping the advantages you have, and receiving an accession of honour and renown;


4.17.4
2640
αἰεὶ γὰρ τοῦ πλέονος ἐλπίδι ὀρέγονται διὰ τὸ καὶ τὰ παρόντα ἀδοκήτως εὐτυχῆσαι .
and not to feel as men do that gain any advantage contrary to their habit; for through hope they are ever grasping for more, because they have unexpectedly enjoyed even their present good luck.


4.17.5
2641
οἷς δὲ πλεῖσται μεταβολαὶ ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα ξυμβεβήκασι , δίκαιοί εἰσι καὶ ἀπιστότατοι εἶναι ταῖς εὐπραγίαις ·
But those who have had most changes of fortune both ways, ought fairly to be most distrustful of prosperity.


4.17.5
2642
ὃ τῇ τε ὑμετέρᾳ πόλει δι’ ἐμπειρίαν καὶ ἡμῖν μάλιστ’ ἂν ἐκ τοῦ εἰκότος προσείη .
And this might reasonably be the case, both with your city, owing to its great experience, and with ourselves.


4.18.1
2643
γνῶτε δὲ καὶ ἐς τὰς ἡμετέρας νῦν ξυμφορὰς ἀπιδόντες , οἵτινες ἀξίωμα μέγιστον τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἔχοντες ἥκομεν παρ’ ὑμᾶς , πρότερον αὐτοὶ κυριώτεροι νομίζοντες εἶναι δοῦναι ἐφ’ ἃ νῦν ἀφιγμένοι ὑμᾶς αἰτούμεθα .
"You may learn this lesson by looking at our present misfortunes; for though enjoying the highest reputation of all the Greeks, we are now come [with this request] to you, though we were before accustomed to think that we had ourselves more power to grant what we have now come to sue for.


4.18.2
2644
καίτοι οὔτε δυνάμεως ἐνδείᾳ ἐπάθομεν αὐτὸ οὔτε μείζονος προσγενομένης ὑβρίσαντες , ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν αἰεὶ ὑπαρχόντων γνώμῃ σφαλέντες , ἐν ᾧ πᾶσι τὸ αὐτὸ ὁμοίως ὑπάρχει .
And yet we were not reduced to this either from decay of power, or from insolence on account of greater accession to it, but from failure in our plans, while reckoning on our ordinary resources;


4.18.3
2645
ὥστε οὐκ εἰκὸς ὑμᾶς διὰ τὴν παροῦσαν νῦν ῥώμην πόλεώς τε καὶ τῶν προσγεγενημένων καὶ τὸ τῆς τύχης οἴεσθαι αἰεὶ μεθ’ ὑμῶν ἔσεσθαι .
a subject in which the same thing is alike incident to all. So that it is not right for you to suppose, that because of the present strength of your city and its accessions, fortune too will be always on your side.


4.18.4
2646
σωφρόνων δὲ ἀνδρῶν οἵτινες τ- ἀγαθὰ ἐς ἀμφίβολον ἀσφαλῶς ἔθεντο ( καὶ ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς οἱ αὐτοὶ εὐξυνετώτερον ἂν προσφέροιντο ) , τόν τε πόλεμον νομίσωσι μὴ καθ’ ὅσον ἄν τις αὐτοῦ μέρος βούληται μεταχειρίζειν , τούτῳ ξυνεῖναι , ἀλλ’ ὡς ἂν αἱ τύχαι αὐτῶν ἡγήσωνται ·
They indeed are wise men who cautiously regard their good things as doubtful; (the same men would also deal with misfortunes more discreetly than others;)


4.18.4
2647
καὶ ἐλάχιστ’ ἂν οἱ τοιοῦτοι πταίοντες διὰ τὸ μὴ τῷ ὀρθουμένῳ αὐτοῦ πιστεύοντες ἐπαίρεσθαι ἐν τῷ εὐτυχεῖν ἂν μάλιστα καταλύοιντο .
and who think that war does not conform itself to that measure on which men may wish to meddle with it, but will proceed as chances may lead them on. Such men, too, while they meet with fewest failures, because they are not elated by confiding in their military success, would be most inclined to bring the war to a conclusion during their prosperity.


4.18.5
2648
ὃ νῦν ὑμῖν , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , καλῶς ἔχει πρὸς ἡμᾶς πρᾶξαι ,καὶ μή ποτε ὕστερον , ἢν ἄρα μὴ πειθόμενοι σφαλῆτε , ἃ πολλὰ ἐνδέχεται , νομισθῆναι τύχῃ καὶ τὰ νῦν προχωρήσαντα κρατῆσαι , ἐξὸν ἀκίνδυνον δόκησιν ἰσχύος καὶ ξυνέσεως ἐς τὸ ἔπειτα καταλιπεῖν .
And you, Athenians, have now an excellent opportunity of doing this with us; and of escaping hereafter, should you not be persuaded by us, and then meet with reverses, (which is very possible,) the imputation of having gained even your present advantages by mere chance; when you might have left behind you a character for power and wisdom exposed to no such hazard.


4.19.1
2649
&quot; Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ ὑμᾶς προκαλοῦνται ἐς σπονδὰς καὶ διάλυσιν πολέμου , διδόντες μὲν εἰρήνην καὶ ξυμμαχίαν καὶ ἄλλην φιλίαν πολλὴν καὶ οἰκειότητα ἐς ἀλλήλους ὑπάρχειν , ἀνταιτοῦντες δὲ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς νήσου ἄνδρας , καὶ ἄμεινον ἡγούμενοι ἀμφοτέροις μὴ διακινδυνεύεσθαι , εἴτε βίᾳ διαφύγοιεν παρατυχούσης τινὸς σωτηρίας εἴτε καὶ ἐκπολιορκηθέντες μᾶλλον ἂν χειρωθεῖεν .
"Now the Lacedaemonians invite you to a treaty and conclusion of the war, offering you peace and alliance, and that there should subsist between us in other respects close friendship and intimacy with one another; while they ask back, in return, their men in the island; at the same time, thinking it better for both parties not to try the chances of war to the uttermost, whether they may escape by force through some accidental means of preservation, or be reduced to surrender, and be more severely dealt with.


4.19.2
2650
νομίζομέν τε τὰς μεγάλας ἔχθρας μάλιστ’ ἂν διαλύεσθαι βεβαίως , οὐκ ἢν ἀνταμυνόμενός τις καὶ ἐπικρατήσας τὰ πλείω τοῦ πολέμου κατ’ ἀνάγκην ὅρκοις ἐγκαταλαμβάνων μὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ξυμβῇ , ἀλλ’ ἢν παρὸν τὸ αὐτὸ δρᾶσαι πρὸς τὸ ἐπιεικὲς καὶ ἀρετῇ αὐτὸν νικήσας παρὰ ἃ προσεδέχετο μετρίως ξυναλλαγῇ .
And we think that great enmities would be most effectually reconciled, not if one party, acting in a revengeful spirit, and after gaining most advantages in the war, should bind the other down by compulsory oaths, and make an arrangement with him on unequal terms; but if, when he might do so, showing regard for fairness, and conquering him by a display of goodness, he should, beyond his expectations, be reconciled to him on moderate terms.


4.19.3
2651
ὀφείλων γὰρ ἤδη ὁ ἐναντίος μὴ ἀνταμύνεσθαι ὡς βιασθείς , ἀλλ’ ἀνταποδοῦναι ἀρετήν , ἑτοιμότερός ἐστιν αἰσχύνῃ ἐμμένειν οἷς ξυνέθετο .
For his adversary being now bound, not to retaliate on him, as one who had been treated with violence, but to make him a return of goodness, is more disposed, for very shame, to abide by the terms of his agreement.


4.19.4
2652
καὶ μᾶλλον πρὸς τοὺς μειζόνως ἐχθροὺς τοῦτο δρῶσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἢ πρὸς τοὺς τὰ μέτρια διενεχθέντας ·
And men act thus towards their greatest enemies, more than towards those who have quarrelled with them in an ordinary degree:


4.19.4
2653
πεφύκασί τε τοῖς μὲν ἑκουσίως ἐνδοῦσιν ἀνθησσᾶσθαι μεθ’ ἡδονῆς , πρὸς δὲ τὰ ὑπεραυχοῦντα καὶ παρὰ γνώμην διακινδυνεύειν .
and they are naturally disposed with pleasure to give way in their turn to such as willingly yield to them; but against those that are overbearing, to hazard all, even against their better judgment.


4.20.1
2654
&quot; ἡμῖν δὲ καλῶς , εἴπερ ποτέ , ἔχει ἀμφοτέροις ἡ ξυναλλαγή , πρίν τι ἀνήκεστον διὰ μέσου γενόμενον ἡμᾶς καταλαβεῖν , ἐν ᾧ ἀνάγκη ἀίδιον ὑμῖν ἔχθραν πρὸς τῇ κοινῇ καὶ ἰδίαν ἔχειν , ὑμᾶς δὲ στερηθῆναι ὧν νῦν προκαλούμεθα .
" To come to terms then were good for both of us now, if ever, before any irremediable disaster overtake us in the mean time; in which case we must for ever feel a private hatred of you, in addition to the public one; and you must lose the advantages to which we now invite you."


4.20.2
2655
ἔτι δ’ ὄντων ἀκρίτων καὶ ὑμῖν μὲν δόξης καὶ ἡμετέρας φιλίας προσγιγνομένης , ἡμῖν δὲ πρὸ αἰσχροῦ τινὸς ξυμφορᾶς μετρίως κατατιθεμένης διαλλαγῶμεν , καὶ αὐτοί τε ἀντὶ πολέμου εἰρήνην ἑλώμεθα καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἕλλησιν ἀνάπαυσιν κακῶν ποιήσωμεν ·
But whilst things are undecided, and whilst glory and friendship with us are offered to you, our own misfortune, on the other hand, being adjusted on moderate terms, before any disgrace befalls us, let us be reconciled,


4.20.2
2656
οἳ καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ὑμᾶς αἰτιωτέρους ἡγήσονται .
and both ourselves choose peace instead of war, and grant a respite from their miseries to the rest of the Greeks; who herein also will think you the chief agents.


4.20.2
2657
πολεμοῦνται μὲν γὰρ ἀσαφῶς ὁποτέρων ἀρξάντων ·
For they are harassed with war without knowing which of the two parties began it;


4.20.2
2658
καταλύσεως δὲ γενομένης , ἧς νῦν ὑμεῖς τὸ πλέον κύριοί ἐστε , τὴν χάριν ὑμῖν προσθήσουσιν .
but if a pacification be effected, on which you have now the greater power to decide, they will refer the obligation to you."


4.20.3
2659
ἤν τε γνῶτε , Λακεδαιμονίοις ἔξεστιν ὑμῖν φίλους γενέσθαι βεβαίως , αὐτῶν τε προκαλεσαμένων χαρισαμένοις τε μᾶλλον ἢ βιασαμένοις .
" If you thus decide, you have an opportunity of becoming firm friends with the Lacedaemonians, at their own request, and by conferring a favour on them, rather than by treating them with violence."


4.20.4
2660
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ τὰ ἐνόντα ἀγαθὰ σκοπεῖτε ὅσα εἰκὸς εἶναι ·
"And in this consider what great advantages are likely to be involved;


4.20.4
2661
ἡμῶν γὰρ καὶ ὑμῶν τ- αὐτὰ λεόντων τό γε ἄλλο Ἑλληνικὸν ἴστε ὅτι ὑποδεέστερον ὂν τὰ μέγιστα τιμήσει &quot; .
for if we and you agree together, be assured that the rest of Greece, being inferior in power, will honour us in the highest degree."


4.21.1
2662
οἱ μὲν οὖν Λακεδαιμόνιοι τοσαῦτα εἶπον , νομίζοντες τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐν τῷ πρὶν χρόνῳ σπονδῶν μὲν ἐπιθυμεῖν , σφῶν δὲ ἐναντιουμένων κωλύεσθαι , διδομένης δὲ εἰρήνης ἀσμένους δέξεσθαί τε καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἀποδώσειν .
The Lacedaemonians then spoke to this effect, thinking that the Athenians were before desirous of a truce, but debarred from it through their own opposition; and that if peace were offered, they would gladly accept it, and give back the men.


4.21.2
2663
οἱ δὲ τὰς μὲν σπονδάς , ἔχοντες τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐν τῇ νήσῳ , ἤδη σφίσιν ἐνόμιζον ἑτοίμους εἶναι , ὁπόταν βούλωνται ποιεῖσθαι πρὸς αὐτούς , τοῦ δὲ πλέονος ὠρέγοντο .
They, however, since they had the men in the island, thought the treaty was now ready for them, whenever they might wish to conclude it with them, and were grasping after further advantage.


4.21.3
2664
μάλιστα δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐνῆγε Κλέων ὁ Κλεαινέτου , ἀνὴρ δημαγωγὸς κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον ὢν καὶ τῷ πλήθει πιθανώτατος ·
They were especially urged to this by Cleon son of Cleaenetus, a demagogue at that time, and most influential with the populace;


4.21.3
2665
καὶ ἔπεισεν ἀποκρίνασθαι ὡς χρὴ τὰ μὲν ὅπλα καὶ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς τοὺς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ παραδόντας πρῶτον κομισθῆναι Ἀθήναζε , ἐλθόντων δὲ ἀποδόντας Λακεδαιμονίους Νίσαιαν καὶ Πηγὰς καὶ Τροιζῆνα καὶ Ἀχαΐαν , ἃ οὐ πολέμῳ ἔλαβον , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τῆς προτέρας ξυμβάσεως Ἀθηναίων ξυγχωρησάντων κατὰ ξυμφορὰς καὶ ἐν τῷ τότε δεομένων τι μᾶλλον σπονδῶν , κομίσασθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας καὶ σπονδὰς ποιήσασθαι ὁπόσον ἂν δοκῇ χρόνον ἀμφοτέροις .
who persuaded them to answer, that the men in the island must first surrender their arms and themselves, and be conveyed to Athens; and that on their arrival, when the Lacedaemonians had restored Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, and Achaia—which they had taken, not by war, but by virtue of the former arrangement, when the Athenians had conceded them under the pressure of calamities, and were at that time somewhat more in need of a truce —they should then recover their men, and conclude a treaty for as long a period as both sides might wish.


4.22.1
2666
οἱ δὲ πρὸς μὲν τὴν ἀπόκρισιν οὐδὲν ἀντεῖπον , ξυνέδρους δὲ σφίσιν ἐκέλευον ἑλέσθαι οἵτινες λέγοντες καὶ ἀκούοντες περὶ ἑκάστου ξυμβήσονται κατὰ ἡσυχίαν ὅτι ἂν πείθωσιν ἀλλήλους .
To this answer they made no reply, but desired them to choose commissioners to meet them, who should speak and hear on each point, and so calmly come to any arrangement to which they might persuade each other.


4.22.2
2667
Κλέων δὲ ἐνταῦθα δὴ πολὺς ἐνέκειτο , λέγων γιγνώσκειν μὲν καὶ πρότερον οὐδὲν ἐν νῷ ἔχοντας δίκαιον αὐτούς , σαφὲς δ’ εἶναι καὶ νῦν ,οἵτινες τῷ μὲν πλήθει οὐδὲν ἐθέλουσιν εἰπεῖν , ὀλίγοις δὲ ἀνδράσι ξύνεδροι βούλονται γίγνεσθαι ·
Upon that Cleon fell violently upon them, saying that he knew beforehand that they had no sound purpose; and it was evident now;


4.22.2
2668
ἀλλὰ εἴ τι ὑγιὲς διανοοῦνται , λέγειν ἐκέλευσεν ἅπασιν .
since they were unwilling to say any thing before the people, but wished to meet in council with a few individuals; if, however, they had any honest intentions, he told them to declare it before all.


4.22.3
2669
ὁρῶντες δὲ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὔτε σφίσιν οἷόν τε ὂν ἐν πλήθει εἰπεῖν , εἴ τι καὶ ὑπὸ τῆς ξυμφορᾶς ἐδόκει αὐτοῖς ξυγχωρεῖν , μὴ ἐς τοὺς ξυμμάχους διαβληθῶσιν εἰπόντες καὶ οὐ τυχόντες , οὔτε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐπὶ μετρίοις ποιήσοντας ἃ προυκαλοῦντο , ἀνεχώρησαν ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ἄπρακτοι .
But the Lacedaemonians seeing that they could not speak before the multitude, (even though they did think it best, in consequence of their misfortune, to make some concessions,) lest they should lose favour with their allies by speaking and not succeeding; and being convinced that the Athenians would not grant their proposals on moderate terms, returned from Athens without effecting their purpose.


4.23.1
2670
ἀφικομένων δὲ αὐτῶν διελέλυντο εὐθὺς αἱ σπονδαὶ αἱ περὶ Πύλον , καὶ τὰς ναῦς οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀπῄτουν , καθάπερ ξυνέκειτο ·
On their arrival, the truce concluded at Pylus was immediately at an end, and the Lacedaemonians asked back their ships, according to agreement.


4.23.1
2671
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐγκλήματα ἔχοντες ἐπιδρομήν τε τῷ τειχίσματι παράσπονδον καὶ ἄλλα οὐκ ἀξιόλογα δοκοῦντα εἶναι οὐκ ἀπεδίδοσαν , ἰσχυριζόμενοι ὅτι δὴ εἴρητο , ἐὰν καὶ ὁτιοῦν παραβαθῇ , λελύσθαι τὰς σπονδάς .
But the Athenians, alleging as grounds of complaint an attack on the fort in contravention of the truce, and other particulars which appear not worth mentioning, refused to return them; laying stress on its having been said, that if there were any violation of it whatever, the truce was at an end.


4.23.1
2672
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀντέλεγόν τε καὶ ἀδίκημα ἐπικαλέσαντες τὸ τῶν νεῶν ἀπελθόντες ἐς πόλεμον καθίσταντο .
The Lacedaemonians denied it, and charging them with injustice in their conduct respecting the ships, went away, and set themselves to the war.


4.23.2
2673
καὶ τὰ περὶ Πύλον ὑπ’ ἀμφοτέρων κατὰ κράτος ἐπολεμεῖτο , Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν δυοῖν νεοῖν ἐναντίαιν αἰεὶ τὴν νῆσον περιπλέοντες τῆς ἡμέρας ( τῆς δὲ νυκτὸς καὶ ἅπασαι περιώρμουν , πλὴν τὰ πρὸς τὸ πέλαγος , ὁπότε ἄνεμος εἴη ·
And now hostilities were carried on at Pylus with the greatest vigour on both sides; the Athenians cruising round the island continually with two ships in opposite directions during the day, while by night they were all moored round it, except on the side of the open sea, whenever there was a wind blowing; (twenty ships too had joined them from Athens to assist in the blockade, so that in all they amounted to seventy;)


4.23.2
2674
καὶ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν αὐτοῖς εἴκοσι νῆες ἀφίκοντο ἐς τὴν φυλακήν , ὥστε αἱ πᾶσαι ἑβδομήκοντα ἐγένοντο ) , Πελοποννήσιοι δὲ ἔν τε τῇ ἠπείρῳ στρατοπεδευόμενοι καὶ προσβολὰς ποιούμενοι τῷ τείχει , σκοποῦντες καιρὸν εἴ τις παραπέσοι ὥστε τοὺς ἄνδρας σῶσαι .
and the Peloponnesians being encamped on the continent, and making attacks on the fort, on the look-out for an opportunity, should any offer, of rescuing their men.


4.24.1
2675
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ οἱ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι πρὸς ταῖς ἐν Μεσσήνῃ φρουρούσαις ναυσὶ τὸ ἄλλο ναυτικὸν ὃ παρεσκευάζοντο προσκομίσαντες τὸν πόλεμον ἐποιοῦντο ἐκ τῆς Μεσσήνης ( καὶ μάλιστα ἐνῆγον οἱ Λοκροὶ τῶν Ῥηγίνων κατὰ ἔχθραν , καὶ αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐσεβεβλήκεσαν πανδημεὶ ἐς τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ) , καὶ ναυμαχίας ἀποπειρᾶσθαι ἐβούλοντο , ὁρῶντες τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τὰς μὲν παρούσας ὀλίγας ναῦς , ταῖς δὲ πλέοσι καὶ μελλούσαις ἥξειν πυνθανόμενοι τὴν νῆσον πολιορκεῖσθαι .
In the mean time the Syracusans and their allies in Sicily, having taken to join the ships on guard at Messana the other squadron which they were preparing, carried on the war from that place.


4.24.4
2676
εἰ γὰρ κρατήσειαν τῷ ναυτικῷ , τὸ Ῥήγιον ἤλπιζον πεζῇ τε καὶ ναυσὶν ἐφορμοῦντες ῥᾳδίως χειρώσεσθαι , καὶ ἤδη σφῶν ἰσχυρὰ τὰ πράγματα γίγνεσθαι ·
For if they gained the advantage by sea, they hoped that by blockading Rhegium both with their land-forces and their ships they would easily reduce it, and then their success would be secured;


4.24.4
2677
ξύνεγγυς γὰρ κειμένου τοῦ τε Ῥηγίου ἀκρωτηρίου τῆς Ἰταλίας τῆς τε Μεσσήνης τῆς Σικελίας , τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τε οὐκ ἂν εἶναι ἐφορμεῖν καὶ τοῦ πορθμοῦ κρατεῖν .
for as the promontory of Rhegium in Italy, and that of Messana in Sicily, lay close together, the Athenians would not be able to cruise against them, and command the strait.


4.24.5
2678
ἔστι δὲ ὁ πορθμὸς ἡ μεταξὺ Ῥηγίου θάλασσα καὶ Μεσσήνης , ᾗπερ βραχύτατον Σικελία τῆς ἠπείρου ἀπέχει ·
This strait is formed by the sea between Rhegium and Messana, where Sicily is at the least distance from the continent;


4.24.5
2679
καὶ ἔστιν ἡ Χάρυβδις κληθεῖσα τοῦτο , ᾗ Ὀδυσσεὺς λέγεται διαπλεῦσαι .
and is the Charybdis, so called, through which Ulysses is said to have sailed.


4.24.5
2680
διὰ στενότητα δὲ καὶ ἐκ μεγάλων πελαγῶν , τοῦ τε Τυρσηνικοῦ καὶ τοῦ Σικελικοῦ , ἐσπίπτουσα ἡ θάλασσα ἐς αὐτὸ καὶ ῥοώδης οὖσα εἰκότως χαλεπὴ ἐνομίσθη .
And as the sea falls into it through a narrow passage from two great mains, the Tuscan and Sicilian, flowing at the same time with a strong current, it has naturally been considered dangerous.


4.25.1
2681
ἐν τούτῳ οὖν τῷ μεταξὺ οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ναυσὶν ὀλίγῳ πλέοσιν ἢ τριάκοντα ἠναγκάσθησαν ὀψὲ τῆς ἡμέρας ναυμαχῆσαι περὶ πλοίου διαπλέοντος , ἀντεπαναγόμενοι πρός τε Ἀθηναίων ναῦς ἑκκαίδεκα καὶ Ῥηγίνας ὀκτώ .
In this strait then the Syracusans and their allies, with rather more than thirty ships, were compelled to engage, late in the day, about the passage of a boat, and put out to meet sixteen vessels from Athens and eight from Rhegium.


4.25.2
2682
καὶ νικηθέντες ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων διὰ τάχους ἀπέπλευσαν ὡς ἕκαστοι ἔτυχον ἐς τὰ οἰκεῖα στρατόπεδα , τό τε ἐν τῇ Μεσσήνῃ καὶ ἐν τῷ Ῥηγίῳ , μίαν ναῦν ἀπολέσαντες ·
Being defeated by the Athenians, they sailed off with all speed, as they severally happened, to their own camps, the one at Rhegium, the other at Messana, after the loss of one ship, night having overtaken them in the action.


4.25.2
2683
καὶ νὺξ ἐπεγένετο τῷ ἔργῳ .
After this, the Locrians withdrew from the Rhegian territory;


4.25.3
2684
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οἱ μὲν Λοκροὶ ἀπῆλθον ἐκ τῆς Ῥηγίνων , ἐπὶ δὲ τὴν Πελωρίδα τῆς Μεσσήνης ξυλλεγεῖσαι αἱ τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ξυμμάχων νῆες ὥρμουν καὶ ὁ πεζὸς αὐτοῖς παρῆν .
and the fleet of the Syracusans and their allies united and came to anchor at Cape Pelorus in the Messanian territory, their land-forces having also joined them.


4.25.4
2685
προσπλεύσαντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Ῥηγῖνοι ὁρῶντες τὰς ναῦς κενὰς ἐνέβαλον , καὶ χειρὶ σιδηρᾷ ἐπιβληθείσῃ μίαν ναῦν αὐτοὶ ἀπώλεσαν τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἀποκολυμβησάντων .
The Athenians and Rhegians sailed up to them, and seeing their ships unmanned, attacked them, and now on  side lost a ship, through an iron grapple having been thrown on it, but the men swam out of it.


4.25.5
2686
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐσβάντων ἐς τὰς ναῦς καὶ παραπλεόντων ἀπὸ κάλω ἐς τὴν Μεσσήνην , αὖθις προσβαλόντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἀποσιμωσάντων ἐκείνων καὶ προεμβαλόντων , ἑτέραν ναῦν ἀπολλύουσιν .
Afterwards, when the Syracusans had gone on board their ships, and were being towed along shore to Messana, the Athenians again advanced against them, and lost another vessel, the enemy having got their ships out into the open sea, and charged them first.


4.25.6
2687
καὶ ἐν τῷ παράπλῳ καὶ τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ τοιουτοτρόπῳ γενομένῃ οὐκ ἔλασσον ἔχοντες οἱ Συρακόσιοι παρεκομίσθησαν ἐς τὸν ἐν τῇ Μεσσήνῃ λιμένα .
Thus the Syracusans had the advantage in the passage along shore and in the engagement, which was such as has been described, and passed on to the port of Messana.


4.25.7
2688
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι , Καμαρίνης ἀγγελθείσης προδίδοσθαι Συρακοσίοις ὑπ’ Ἀρχίου καὶ τῶν μετ’ αὐτοῦ , ἔπλευσαν ἐκεῖσε ·
The Athenians, on receiving tidings that Camarina was going to be betrayed to the Syracusans by Archias and his party, sailed thither;


4.25.7
2689
Μεσσήνιοι δ’ ἐν τούτῳ πανδημεὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ ταῖς ναυσὶν ἅμα ἐστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Νάξον τὴν Χαλκιδικὴν ὅμορον οὖσαν .
while the Messanians, in the meantime, with all their forces made an expedition, at once by land and by sea, against Naxos, a Chalcidian town near their borders.


4.25.8
2690
καὶ τῇ πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τειχήρεις ποιήσαντες τοὺς Ναξίους ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν , τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ταῖς μὲν ναυσὶ περιπλεύσαντες κατὰ τὸν Ἀκεσίνην ποταμὸν τὴν γῆν ἐδῄουν , τῷ δὲ πεζῷ πρὸς τὴν πόλιν ἐσέβαλλον .
The first day, having driven the Naxians within their walls, they ravaged the land, and the next day sailed round with their fleet, and did the same in the direction of the river Acesines, while with their land-forces they made their incursion towards the city.


4.25.9
2691
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ οἱ Σικελοὶ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἄκρων πολλοὶ κατέβαινον βοηθοῦντες ἐπὶ τοὺς Μεσσηνίους .
Meanwhile the Sicels came down from the highlands in great numbers to assist against the Messanians;


4.25.9
2692
καὶ οἱ Νάξιοι ὡς εἶδον , θαρσήσαντες καὶ παρακελευόμενοι ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ὡς οἱ Λεοντῖνοι σφίσι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες ξύμμαχοι ἐς τιμωρίαν ἐπέρχονται , ἐκδραμόντες ἄφνω ἐκ τῆς πόλεως προσπίπτουσι τοῖς Μεσσηνίοις , καὶ τρέψαντες ἀπέκτεινάν τε ὑπὲρ χιλίους καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ χαλεπῶς ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου ·
and when the Naxians saw them, they took courage, and cheering themselves with the belief that the Leontines and other Grecian allies were coming to their aid, made a sudden sally from the town, and fell upon the Messanians, and having routed them, slew more than a thousand, the rest having a miserable return homeward;


4.25.9
2693
καὶ γὰρ οἱ βάρβαροι ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς ἐπιπεσόντες τοὺς πλείστους διέφθειραν .
for the barbarians fell upon them on the road, and cut off most of them.


4.25.10
2694
καὶ αἱ νῆες σχοῦσαι ἐς τὴν Μεσσήνην ὕστερον ἐπ’ οἴκου ἕκασται διεκρίθησαν .
The ships, having put in at Messana, subsequently dispersed for their several homes.


4.25.10
2695
Λεοντῖνοι δὲ εὐθὺς καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι μετὰ Ἀθηναίων ἐς τὴν Μεσσήνην ὡς κεκακωμένην ἐστράτευον , καὶ προσβάλλοντες οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι κατὰ τὸν λιμένα ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐπείρων , ὁ δὲ πεζὸς πρὸς τὴν πόλιν .
Immediately after this, the Leontines and their allies, in conjunction with the Athenians, turned their arms against Messana, in the belief of its having been weakened; and attempted it by an attack, the Athenians with their ships on the side of the harbour, the land-forces on the side of the town.


4.25.11
2696
ἐπεκδρομὴν δὲ ποιησάμενοι οἱ Μεσσήνιοι καὶ Λοκρῶν τινὲς μετὰ τοῦ Δημοτέλους , οἳ μετὰ τὸ πάθος ἐγκατελείφθησαν φρουροί , ἐξαπιναίως προσπεσόντες τρέπουσι τοῦ στρατεύματος τῶν Λεοντίνων τὸ πολὺ καὶ ἀπέκτειναν πολλούς .
But the Messanians, and some Locrians with Demoteles, who after its disaster had been left in it as a garrison, suddenly fell upon them, and routed the greater part of the Leontine troops, and slew many of them.


4.25.11
2697
ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ ἀποβάντες ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν ἐβοήθουν , καὶ κατεδίωξαν τοὺς Μεσσηνίους πάλιν ἐς τὴν πόλιν ,τεταραγμένοις ἐπιγενόμενοι ·
The Athenians, on seeing it, landing from their ships, went to their assistance, and drove the Messanians back again into the town, having come upon them while in confusion;


4.25.11
2698
καὶ τροπαῖον στήσαντες ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὸ Ῥήγιον .
they then erected a trophy and returned to Rhegium.


4.25.12
2699
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οἱ μὲν ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ Ἕλληνες ἄνευ τῶν Ἀθηναίων κατὰ γῆν ἐστράτευον ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους .
After this, the Greeks in Sicily continued to make war on each other by land without the co-operation of the Athenians.


4.26.1
2700
ἐν δὲ τῇ Πύλῳ ἔτι ἐπολιόρκουν τοὺς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ Λακεδαιμονίους οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , καὶ τὸ ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ στρατόπεδον τῶν Πελοποννησίων κατὰ χώραν ἔμενεν .
At Pylus, in the mean time, the Athenians were still blockading the Lacedaemonians in the island, and the Peloponnesian forces on the continent remained where they were. But the watch was kept by the Athenians with great trouble, through want of both victuals and water;


4.26.2
2701
ἐπίπονος δ’ ἦν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἡ φυλακὴ σίτου τε ἀπορίᾳ καὶ ὕδατος ·
for there was no spring but one in the citadel of Pylus itself, and that not a copious one;


4.26.2
2702
οὐ γὰρ ἦν κρήνη ὅτι μὴ μία ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἀκροπόλει τῆς Πύλου καὶ αὕτη οὐ μεγάλη , ἀλλὰ διαμώμενοι τὸν κάχληκα οἱ πλεῖστοι ἐπὶ τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἔπινον οἷον εἰκὸς ὕδωρ .
but most of them were drinking such water as they would be likely to find by digging through the shingle near the sea. They suffered too from want of room, being encamped in a narrow space;


4.26.3
2703
στενοχωρία τε ἐν ὀλίγῳ στρατοπεδευομένοις ἐγίγνετο , καὶ τῶν νεῶν οὐκ ἐχουσῶν ὅρμον αἱ μὲν σῖτον ἐν τῇ γῇ ᾑροῦντο κατὰ μέρος , αἱ δὲ μετέωροι ὥρμουν .
and as the ships had no roadstead, some of them took their meals on shore in their turn, while others lay off at anchor. But their greatest discouragement was caused by the time being prolonged beyond their expectation;


4.26.4
2704
ἀθυμίαν τε πλείστην ὁ χρόνος παρεῖχε παρὰ λόγον ἐπιγιγνόμενος , οὓς ᾤοντο ἡμερῶν ὀλίγων ἐκπολιορκήσειν ἐν νήσῳ τε ἐρήμῃ καὶ ὕδατι ἁλμυρῷ χρωμένους .
for they imagined that they should reduce them to surrender in a few days, shut up in a desert island as they were, and having only brackish water to drink.


4.26.5
2705
αἴτιον δὲ ἦν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι προειπόντες ἐς τὴν νῆσον ἐσάγειν σῖτόν τε τὸν βουλόμενον ἀληλεμένον καὶ οἶνον καὶ τυρὸν καὶ εἴ τι ἄλλο βρῶμα , οἷ’ ἂν ἐς πολιορκίαν ξυμφέρῃ , τάξαντες ἀργυρίου πολλοῦ καὶ τῶν Εἱλώτων τῷ ἐσαγαγόντι ἐλευθερίαν ὑπισχνούμενοι .
The cause of this delay was the Lacedaemonians having proclaimed, that any one who wished should carry into the island ground corn, wine, cheese, and any other food that might be serviceable in the siege; rating it at a high price, and promising freedom to any of the Helots who should carry it in.


4.26.6
2706
καὶ ἐσῆγον ἄλλοι τε παρακινδυνεύοντες καὶ μάλιστα οἱ Εἵλωτες , ἀπαίροντες ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ὁπόθεν τύχοιεν καὶ καταπλέοντες ἔτι νυκτὸς ἐς τὰ πρὸς τὸ πέλαγος τῆς νήσου .
Many others therefore carried it in, at all risks, and especially the Helots, putting out from any part of the Peloponnesians, as might happen, and landing by night on the side of the island towards the open sea.


4.26.7
2707
μάλιστα δὲ ἐτήρουν ἀνέμῳ καταφέρεσθαι ·
But what they particularly watched for was a chance of being carried to shore by a wind;


4.26.7
2708
ῥᾷον γὰρ τὴν φυλακὴν τῶν τριήρων ἐλάνθανον , ὁπότε πνεῦμα ἐκ πόντου εἴη ·
for they more easily escaped the look-out of the triremes, when there was a breeze from sea-ward;


4.26.7
2709
ἄπορον γὰρ ἐγίγνετο περιορμεῖν , τοῖς δὲ ἀφειδὴς ὁ κατάπλους καθειστήκει ·
as it was then impossible for the cruisers to anchor round it, while their own landing was effected in a reckless manner;


4.26.7
2710
ἐπώκελλον γὰρ τὰ πλοῖα τετιμημένα χρημάτων , καὶ οἱ ὁπλῖται περὶ τὰς κατάρσεις τῆς νήσου ἐφύλασσον .
for their boats being rated at their value in money, they drove them up on the beach, while the soldiers were watching for them at the landing-places in the island.


4.26.7
2711
ὅσοι δὲ γαλήνῃ κινδυνεύσειαν , ἡλίσκοντο .
But all that ran the risk in calm weather were taken prisoners.


4.26.8
2712
ἐσένεον δὲ καὶ κατὰ τὸν λιμένα κολυμβηταὶ ὕφυδροι ,καλῳδίῳ ἐν ἀσκοῖς ἐφέλκοντες μήκωνα μεμελιτωμένην καὶ λίνου σπέρμα κεκομμένον ·
Divers also swam in under water on the side of the harbour, dragging by a cord in skins poppy-seed mixed with honey, and bruised linseed;


4.26.8
2713
ὧν τὸ πρῶτον λανθανόντων φυλακαὶ ὕστερον ἐγένοντο .
but though these escaped unobserved at first, precautions were afterwards taken against them.


4.26.9
2714
παντί τε τρόπῳ ἑκάτεροι ἐτεχνῶντο οἱ μὲν ἐσπέμπειν τὰ σιτία , οἱ δὲ μὴ λανθάνειν σφᾶς .
Indeed each party contrived in every possible manner, the one to throw in provisions, the other to prevent its being done without their observation.


4.27.1
2715
ἐν δὲ ταῖς Ἀθήναις πυνθανόμενοι περὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς ὅτι ταλαιπωρεῖται καὶ σῖτος τοῖς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ὅτι ἐσπλεῖ , ἠπόρουν καὶ ἐδεδοίκεσαν μὴ σφῶν χειμὼν τὴν φυλακὴν ἐπιλάβοι , ὁρῶντες τῶν τε ἐπιτηδείων τὴν περὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον κομιδὴν ἀδύνατον ἐσομένην , ἅμα ἐν χωρίῳ ἐρήμῳ καὶ οὐδ’ ἐν θέρει οἷοί τε ὄντες ἱκανὰ περιπέμπειν , τόν τε ἔφορμον χωρίων ἀλιμένων ὄντων οὐκ ἐσόμενον , ἀλλ’ ἢ σφῶν ἀνέντων τὴν φυλακὴν περιγενήσεσθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας ἢ τοῖς πλοίοις ἃ τὸν σῖτον αὐτοῖς ἦγε χειμῶνα τηρήσαντας ἐκπλεύσεσθαι .
When they heard at Athens the circumstances of the army, that it was thus being harassed, and that corn was thus taken in for the men in the island, they were perplexed, and afraid that winter might surprise them in the blockade. For they saw that both carrying provisions round the Peloponnese would then be impossible—at the same time they were in an uninhabited country, [where they could get none themselves,] and even in summer they were not able to send round sufficient supplies for them—and that the blockade by sea of so harbourless a country could not be continued; but that the men would either escape through their giving up their guard, or would watch for a storm, and sail out in the boats that carried the corn in for them.


4.27.2
2716
πάντων τε ἐφοβοῦντο μάλιστα τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , ὅτι ἔχοντάς τι ἰσχυρὸν αὐτοὺς ἐνόμιζον οὐκέτι σφίσιν ἐπικηρυκεύεσθαι ·
Above all, they were alarmed by the conduct of the Lacedaemonians; for they imagined that it was from their having some strong point on their side that they made no more overtures to them;


4.27.2
2717
καὶ μετεμέλοντο τὰς σπονδὰς οὐ δεξάμενοι .
and they regretted not having assented to the treaty.


4.27.3
2718
Κλέων δὲ γνοὺς αὐτῶν τὴν ἐς αὑτὸν ὑποψίαν περὶ τῆς κωλύμης τῆς ξυμβάσεως οὐ τ- ἀληθῆ ἔφη λέγειν τοὺς ἐξαγγέλλοντας .
Cleon observing their suspicions of him, with regard to the obstacles thrown in the way of the convention, said that their informants did not speak the truth.


4.27.3
2719
παραινούντων δὲ τῶν ἀφιγμένων , εἰ μὴ σφίσι πιστεύουσι , κατασκόπους τινὰς πέμψαι , ᾑρέθη κατάσκοπος αὐτὸς μετὰ Θεαγένους ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων .
When those who had come with the tidings advised them, if they did not believe them, to send some commissioners to see, he himself, with Theogenes, was chosen by the Athenians for that purpose.


4.27.4
2720
καὶ γνοὺς ὅτι ἀναγκασθήσεται ἢ τ- αὐτὰ λέγειν οἷς διέβαλλεν ἢ τ- ἐναντία εἰπὼν ψευδὴς φανήσεσθαι , παρῄνει τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , ὁρῶν αὐτοὺς καὶ ὡρμημένους τι τὸ πλέον τῇ γνώμῃ στρατεύειν , ὡς χρὴ κατασκόπους μὲν μὴ πέμπειν μηδὲ διαμέλλειν καιρὸν παριέντας , εἰ δὲ δοκεῖ αὐτοῖς ἀληθῆ εἶναι τὰ ἀγγελλόμενα , πλεῖν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας .
Aware therefore that he would be compelled either to give the same account as those whom he was slandering, or to be proved a liar if he gave a different one, he advised the Athenians—seeing that they were really more inclined in their minds for a fresh expedition—that they should not send commissioners, nor delay and waste their opportunity, but sail against the men, if they thought the report was true.


4.27.5
2721
καὶ ἐς Νικίαν τὸν Νικηράτου στρατηγὸν ὄντα ἀπεσήμαινεν , ἐχθρὸς ὢν καὶ ἐπιτιμῶν , ῥᾴδιον εἶναι παρασκευῇ , εἰ ἄνδρες εἶεν οἱ στρατηγοί , πλεύσαντας λαβεῖν τοὺς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ , καὶ αὐτός γ’ ἄν , εἰ ἦρχε , ποιῆσαι τοῦτο .
And he pointedly alluded to Nicias the son of Niceratus, who was general at the time; hating him, and tauntingly observing, that it was easy, if their generals were men, to sail with a force and take those in the island; and that if he had himself been in office, he would have done it.


4.28.1
2722
ὁ δὲ Νικίας τῶν τε Ἀθηναίων τι ὑποθορυβησάντων ἐς τὸν Κλέωνα , ὅτι οὐ καὶ νῦν πλεῖ , εἰ ῥᾴδιόν γε αὐτῷ φαίνεται , καὶ ἅμα ὁρῶν αὐτὸν ἐπιτιμῶντα , ἐκέλευεν ἥντινα βούλεται δύναμιν λαβόντα τὸ ἐπὶ σφᾶς εἶναι ἐπιχειρεῖν .
Nicias, observing that the Athenians began to murmur at Cleon for not sailing as it was, if he thought it so easy, and at the same time seeing that he aimed his taunts at  desired him to take whatever force he chose, as far as the generals were concerned, and make the attempt.


4.28.2
2723
ὁ δὲ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον οἰόμενος αὐτὸν λόγῳ μόνον ἀφιέναι ἑτοῖμος ἦν , γνοὺς δὲ τῷ ὄντι παραδωσείοντα ἀνεχώρει καὶ οὐκ ἔφη αὐτὸς ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνον στρατηγεῖν , δεδιὼς ἤδη καὶ οὐκ ἂν οἰόμενός οἱ αὐτὸν τολμῆσαι ὑποχωρῆσαι .
Cleon, thinking at first that he only pretended to give up the command to him, was prepared to accept it; but when he found that he really wished to transfer it to him, he drew back, and said that he was not general, but they; being afraid now, and not supposing that Nicias would have brought himself to retire in his favour.


4.28.3
2724
αὖθις δὲ ὁ Νικίας ἐκέλευε καὶ ἐξίστατο τῆς ἐπὶ Πύλῳ ἀρχῆς καὶ μάρτυρας τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐποιεῖτο .
He, however, again urged him to undertake it, and resigned the command against Pylus, and called on the Athenians to attest it.


4.28.3
2725
οἱ δέ , οἷον ὄχλος φιλεῖ ποιεῖν , ὅσῳ μᾶλλον ὁ Κλέων ὑπέφευγε τὸν πλοῦν καὶ ἐξανεχώρει τὰ εἰρημένα , τόσῳ ἐπεκελεύοντο τῷ Νικίᾳ παραδιδόναι τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ ἐκείνῳ ἐπεβόων πλεῖν .
They, as the multitude is ever wont to do, the more Cleon shrank from the expedition, and tried to escape from what he had said, pressed Nicias the more to give up the command to him, and called loudly on Cleon to set sail.


4.28.4
2726
ὥστε οὐκ ἔχων ὅπως τῶν εἰρημένων ἔτι ἐξαπαλλαγῇ , ὑφίσταται τὸν πλοῦν , καὶ παρελθὼν οὔτε φοβεῖσθαι ἔφη Λακεδαιμονίους πλεύσεσθαί τε λαβὼν ἐκ μὲν τῆς πόλεως οὐδένα , Λημνίους δὲ καὶ Ἰμβρίους τοὺς παρόντας καὶ πελταστὰς οἳ ἦσαν ἔκ τε Αἴνου βεβοηθηκότες καὶ ἄλλοθεν τοξότας τετρακοσίους ·
So that not knowing how to evade his words any longer, he undertook the voyage, and, coming forward, said, that he was not afraid of the Lacedaemonians, but would set sail, taking with him no one out of the city, but only the Lemnians and Imbrians that were there, with some targeteers that had come to their aid from Oenus, and four hundred bowmen from other quarters.


4.28.4
2727
ταῦτα δὲ ἔχων ἔφη πρὸς τοῖς ἐν Πύλω στρατιώταις ἐντὸς ἡμερῶν εἴκοσιν ἢ ἄξειν Λακεδαιμονίους ζῶντας ἢ αὐτοῦ ἀποκτενεῖν .
With these, in addition to the soldiers at Pylus, he said that within twenty days he would either bring the Lacedaemonians alive, or kill them on the spot.


4.28.5
2728
τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις ἐνέπεσε μέν τι καὶ γέλωτος τῇ κουφολογίᾳ αὐτοῦ , ἀσμένοις δ’ ὅμως ἐγίγνετο τοῖς σώφροσι τῶν ἀνθρώπων , λογιζομένοις δυοῖν ἀγαθοῖν τοῦ ἑτέρου τεύξεσθαι , ἢ Κλέωνος ἀπαλλαγήσεσθαι , ὃ μᾶλλον ἤλπιζον , ἢ σφαλεῖσι γνώμης Λακεδαιμονίους σφίσι χειρώσεσθαι .
The Athenians were seized with laughter at his vain talking, but nevertheless the sensible part of them were pleased with the business, reckoning that they should gain one of two good things; either to be rid of Cleon, which they rather hoped, or, if deceived in their opinion, to get the Lacedaemonians into their hands.


4.29.1
2729
καὶ πάντα διαπραξάμενος ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ καὶ ψηφισαμένων Ἀθηναίων αὐτῷ τὸν πλοῦν , τῶν τε ἐν Πύλῳ στρατηγῶν ἕνα προσελόμενος Δημοσθένη , τὴν ἀναγωγὴν διὰ τάχους ἐποιεῖτο .
When he had thus arranged every thing in the assembly, and the Athenians had voted him the command of the expedition, having associated with himself one of the generals at Pylus, namely, Demosthenes, he prepared to set sail as quickly as possible.


4.29.2
2730
τὸν δὲ Δημοσθένη προσέλαβε πυνθανόμενος τὴν ἀπόβασιν αὐτὸν ἐς τὴν νῆσον διανοεῖσθαι .
He chose Demosthenes for his colleague, because he heard that he was himself meditating a descent on the island.


4.29.2
2731
οἱ γὰρ στρατιῶται κακοπαθοῦντες τοῦ χωρίου τῇ ἀπορίᾳ καὶ μᾶλλον πολιορκούμενοι ἢ πολιορκοῦντες ὥρμηντο διακινδυνεῦσαι .
For the soldiers, being distressed by their want of room, and being a besieged rather than a besieging party, were eager to run all risks.


4.29.2
2732
καὶ αὐτῷ ἔτι ῥώμην καὶ ἡ νῆσος ἐμπρησθεῖσα παρέσχεν .
The firing of the island had moreover given him confidence.


4.29.3
2733
πρότερον μὲν γὰρ οὔσης αὐτῆς ὑλώδους ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ καὶ ἀτριβοῦς διὰ τὴν αἰεὶ ἐρημίαν ἐφοβεῖτο καὶ πρὸς τῶν πολεμίων τοῦτο ἐνόμιζε μᾶλλον εἶναι ·
For formerly, in consequence of its being extensively covered with wood, and pathless, from its having always been uninhabited, he was afraid, and considered this to be rather in favour of the enemy;


4.29.3
2734
πολλῷ γὰρ ἂν στρατοπέδῳ ἀποβάντι ἐξ ἀφανοῦς χωρίου προσβάλλοντας αὐτοὺς βλάπτειν .
as when he landed with a large force, they might attack him from an unseen position, and so do him damage.


4.29.3
2735
σφίσι μὲν γὰρ τὰς ἐκείνων ἁμαρτίας καὶ παρασκευὴν ὑπὸ τῆς ὕλης οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως δῆλα εἶναι , τοῦ δὲ αὑτῶν στρατοπέδου καταφανῆ ἂν εἶναι πάντα τὰ ἁμαρτήματα , ὥστε προσπίπτειν ἂν αὐτοὺς ἀπροσδοκήτως ᾗ βούλοιντο ·
For, owing to the forest, their mistakes and amount of forces would not be so distinctly seen by him, while all the blunders of his troops would be visible to them; so that they might fall on him unexpectedly at whatever point they pleased.


4.29.3
2736
ἐπ’ ἐκείνοις γὰρ εἶναι ἂν τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν .
For it being always in their power to make the attack.


4.29.4
2737
εἰ δ’ αὖ ἐς δασὺ χωρίον βιάζοιτο ὁμόσε ἰέναι , τοὺς ἐλάσσους , ἐμπείρους δὲ τῆς χώρας , κρείσσους ἐνόμιζε τῶν πλεόνων ἀπείρων ·
And if, again, he should force them to an engagement in the forest, he thought the smaller number, with knowledge of the country, would have an advantage over the larger without that knowledge;


4.29.4
2738
λανθάνειν τε ἂν τὸ ἑαυτῶν στρατόπεδον πολὺ ὂν διαφθειρόμενον , οὐκ οὔσης τῆς προσόψεως ᾗ χρῆν ἀλλήλοις ἐπιβοηθεῖν .
and that their own army, great as it was, might imperceptibly be cut off, while they could not see in which direction to assist each other.


4.30.1
2739
ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ Αἰτωλικοῦ πάθους , ὃ διὰ τὴν ὕλην μέρος τι ἐγένετο , οὐχ ἥκιστα αὐτὸν ταῦτα ἐσῄει .
It was, above all, from his disaster in Aetolia, which in a great measure had been occasioned by the forest, that these thoughts struck him.


4.30.2
2740
τῶν δὲ στρατιωτῶν ἀναγκασθέντων διὰ τὴν στενοχωρίαν τῆς νήσου τοῖς ἐσχάτοις προσίσχοντας ἀριστοποιεῖσθαι διὰ προφυλακῆς καὶ ἐμπρήσαντός τινος κατὰ μικρὸν τῆς ὕλης ἄκοντος καὶ ἀπὸ τούτου πνεύματος ἐπιγενομένου τὸ πολὺ αὐτῆς ἔλαθε κατακαυθέν .
The soldiers, however, having been compelled by want of room to land on the extremities of the island, and take their dinners, with a guard posted in advance; and one of them having unintentionally set fire to a small part of the wood, and a wind having afterwards risen, the greater part of it was consumed before they were aware of it.


4.30.3
2741
οὕτω δὴ τούς τε Λακεδαιμονίους μᾶλλον κατιδὼν πλείους ὄντας , ὑπονοῶν πρότερον ἐλάσσοσι τὸν σῖτον αὐτοῦ ἐσπέμπειν , τήν τε νῆσον εὐαποβατωτέραν οὖσαν , τότε ὡς ἐπ’ ἀξιόχρεων τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μᾶλλον σπουδὴν ποιεῖσθαι τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν παρεσκευάζετο , στρατιάν τε μεταπέμπων ἐκ τῶν ἐγγὺς ξυμμάχων καὶ τὰ ἄλλα ἑτοιμάζων .
In this way then observing, on a clearer view, that the Lacedaemonians were more numerous than he had expected—for before this, he imagined that they took in provisions for a smaller number—and now perceiving that the Athenians were more in earnest about it, as a thing that was worth their attention, and that the island was more easy to land on, he was preparing for the adventure, by sending for troops from the neighbouring allies, and getting every thing else in readiness.


4.30.4
2742
Κλέων δὲ ἐκείνῳ τε προπέμψας ἄγγελον ὡς ἥξων καὶ ἔχων στρατιὰν ἣν ᾐτήσατο , ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Πύλον .
Cleon, after previously sending him word that he was coming, arrived at Pylus with the forces he had asked for.


4.30.4
2743
καὶ ἅμα γενόμενοι πέμπουσι πρῶτον ἐς τὸ ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ στρατόπεδον κήρυκα , προκαλούμενοι , εἰ βούλοιντο , ἄνευ κινδύνου τοὺς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ἄνδρας σφίσι τά τε ὅπλα καὶ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς κελεύειν παραδοῦναι , ἐφ’ ᾧ φυλακῇ τῇ μετρίᾳ τηρήσονται , ἕως ἄν τι περὶ τοῦ πλέονος ξυμβαθῇ .
After their meeting, they sent, in the first place, a herald to the camp on the continent, wishing to know whether, without running any risk, they would desire the men in the island to surrender to them their arms and themselves, on condition of their being kept in mild custody, till some general agreement were concluded.


4.31.1
2744
οὐ προσδεξαμένων δὲ αὐτῶν μίαν μὲν ἡμέραν ἐπέσχον , τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἀνηγάγοντο μὲν νυκτὸς ἐπ’ ὀλίγας ναῦς τοὺς ὁπλίτας πάντας ἐπιβιβάσαντες , πρὸ δὲ τῆς ἕω ὀλίγον ἀπέβαινον τῆς νήσου ἑκατέρωθεν , ἔκ τε τοῦ πελάγους καὶ πρὸς τοῦ λιμένος , ὀκτακόσιοι μάλιστα ὄντες ὁπλῖται , καὶ ἐχώρουν δρόμῳ ἐπὶ τὸ πρῶτον φυλακτήριον τῆς νήσου .
When they did not accept their proposal, they waited one day, and on the next put out by night, having embarked all their heavy-armed on board a few vessels, and a little before morning effected a landing on each side of the island, both that of the open sea and that of the harbour, amounting to about eight hundred heavy-armed, and proceeded at a run against the first post in the island.


4.31.2
2745
ὧδε γὰρ διετετάχατο ·
For the following was the way in which the men were disposed.


4.31.2
2746
ἐν ταύτῃ μὲν τῇ πρώτῃ φυλακῇ ὡς τριάκοντα ἦσαν ὁπλῖται , μέσον δὲ καὶ ὁμαλώτατόν τε καὶ περὶ τὸ ὕδωρ οἱ πλεῖστοι αὐτῶν καὶ Ἐπιτάδας ὁ ἄρχων εἶχε , μέρος δέ τι οὐ πολὺ αὐτὸ τὸ ἔσχατον ἐφύλασσε τῆς νήσου τὸ πρὸς τὴν Πύλον , ὃ ἦν ἔκ τε θαλάσσης ἀπόκρημνον καὶ ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἥκιστα ἐπίμαχον ·
In this first guard there were thirty heavy-armed; the centre and most level part was held by their main body, and Epitadas their commander; while a small division guarded the very corner of the island, towards Pylus, which on the sea side was precipitous, and on the land side least exposed to assault.


4.31.2
2747
καὶ γάρ τι καὶ ἔρυμα αὐτόθι ἦν παλαιὸν λίθων λογάδην πεποιημένον , ὃ ἐνόμιζον σφίσιν ὠφέλιμον ἂν εἶναι , εἰ καταλαμβάνοι ἀναχώρησις βιαιοτέρα .
For there stood there an old fort, rudely built of stone, which they thought might be of service to them, if they should be driven to a compulsory retreat.


4.31.2
2748
οὕτω μὲν τεταγμένοι ἦσαν .
In this way then were they posted.


4.32.1
2749
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς μὲν πρώτους φύλακας , οἷς ἐπέδραμον , εὐθὺς διαφθείρουσιν ἔν τε ταῖς εὐναῖς ἔτι καὶ ἀναλαμβάνοντας τὰ ὅπλα , λαθόντες τὴν ἀπόβασιν , οἰομένων αὐτῶν τὰς ναῦς κατὰ τὸ ἔθος ἐς ἔφορμον τῆς νυκτὸς πλεῖν .
The Athenians immediately put to the sword the men forming the first guard, whom they had thus attacked; for they were still in their beds, or only just taking up their arms, the landing having surprised them, as they fancied that the ships were only sailing, according to custom, to their stations for the night.


4.32.2
2750
ἅμα δὲ ἕῳ γιγνομένῃ καὶ ὁ ἄλλος στρατὸς ἀπέβαινεν , ἐκ μὲν νεῶν ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ ὀλίγῳ πλεόνων πάντες πλὴν θαλαμιῶν , ὡς ἕκαστοι ἐσκευασμένοι , τοξόται δὲ ὀκτακόσιοι καὶ πελτασταὶ οὐκ ἐλάσσους τούτων , Μεσσηνίων τε οἱ βεβοηθηκότες καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ὅσοι περὶ Πύλον κατεῖχον πάντες πλὴν τῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους φυλάκων .
As soon as it was morning, the rest of the forces also disembarked, viz. all the crews of seventy ships and rather more,(except the lowest rank of rowers,) with their different equipments; eight hundred bowmen, and no less a number of targeteers, the Messenian reinforcements, and all others who were in any positions about Pylus, except the garrison on the fortifications.


4.32.3
2751
Δημοσθένους δὲ τάξαντος διέστησαν κατὰ διακοσίους τε καὶ πλείους , ἔστι δ’ ᾗ ἐλάσσους , τῶν χωρίων τὰ μετεωρότατα λαβόντες , ὅπως ὅτι πλείστη ἀπορία ᾖ τοῖς πολεμίοις πανταχόθεν κεκυκλωμένοις καὶ μὴ ἔχωσι πρὸς ὅτι ἀντιτάξωνται , ἀλλ’ ἀμφίβολοι γίγνωνται τῷ πλήθει , εἰ μὲν τοῖς πρόσθεν ἐπίοιεν , ὑπὸ τῶν κατόπιν βαλλόμενοι , εἰ δὲ τοῖς πλαγίοις , ὑπὸ τῶν ἑκατέρωθεν παρατεταγμένων .
By the arrangement of Demosthenes, they were divided into parties of two hundred, more or less, and occupied the highest grounds, that the enemy might be most severely harassed by being surrounded on all sides, and not know where to make resistance, but be annoyed by a double discharge of missiles; being attacked by those behind them, if they charged those before, and by those posted on each side, if they made a flank movement.


4.32.4
2752
κατὰ νώτου τε αἰεὶ ἔμελλον αὐτοῖς , ᾗ χωρήσειαν , οἱ πολέμιοι ἔσεσθαι ψιλοὶ καὶ οἱ ἀπορώτατοι , τοξεύμασι καὶ ἀκοντίοις καὶ λίθοις καὶ σφενδόναις ἐκ πολλοῦ ἔχοντες ἀλκήν , οἷς μηδὲ ἐπελθεῖν οἷόν τε ἦν ·
And so, wherever they went, they would have the enemy on their rear, light-armed, and the most difficult to deal with, being strong at a distance from the use of arrows, darts, stones, and slings, and it being impossible even to get near them;


4.32.4
2753
φεύγοντές τε γὰρ ἐκράτουν καὶ ἀναχωροῦσιν ἐπέκειντο .
for they would conquer while flying, and when their enemy retreated, would press them close.


4.32.4
2754
τοιαύτῃ μὲν γνώμῃ ὁ Δημοσθένης τό τε πρῶτον τὴν ἀπόβασιν ἐπενόει καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ ἔταξεν ·
It was with such a view of the case that Demosthenes both originally planned the descent, and made his arrangements in the execution of it.


4.33.1
2755
οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Ἐπιτάδαν καὶ ὅπερ ἦν πλεῖστον τῶν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ , ὡς εἶδον τό τε πρῶτον φυλακτήριον διεφθαρμένον καὶ στρατὸν σφίσιν ἐπιόντα , ξυνετάξαντο καὶ τοῖς ὁπλίταις τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπῇσαν , βουλόμενοι ἐς χεῖρας ἐλθεῖν ·
The party under Epitadas, which was also the main division in the island, on seeing the first post cut off, and an army advancing against themselves, closed their ranks, and advanced to meet the heavy-armed of the Athenians, with a wish to engage with them;


4.33.1
2756
ἐξ ἐναντίας γὰρ οὗτοι καθειστήκεσαν , ἐκ πλαγίου δὲ οἱ ψιλοὶ καὶ κατὰ νώτου .
for they were stationed on their front, but the light-armed on their flanks and rear.


4.33.2
2757
τοῖς μὲν οὖν ὁπλίταις οὐκ ἐδυνήθησαν προσμεῖξαι οὐδὲ τῇ σφετέρᾳ ἐμπειρίᾳ χρήσασθαι ·
They could not however come up with them, and avail themselves of their superior skill in arms;


4.33.2
2758
οἱ γὰρ ψιλοὶ ἑκατέρωθεν βάλλοντες εἶργον , καὶ ἅμα ἐκεῖνοι οὐκ ἀντεπῇσαν , ἀλλ’ ἡσύχαζον ·
(for the light troops kept them in check with their missiles from both sides; while at the same time the heavy-armed did not come on to meet them, but remained still;)


4.33.2
2759
τοὺς δὲ ψιλούς , ᾗ μάλιστα αὐτοῖς ἐπιθέοντες προσκέοιντο , ἔτρεπον , καὶ οἳ ὑποστρέφοντες ἠμύνοντο , ἄνθρωποι κούφως τε ἐσκευασμένοι καὶ προλαμβάνοντες ῥᾳδίως τῆς φυγῆς χωρίων τε χαλεπότητι καὶ ὑπὸ τῆς πρὶν ἐρημίας τραχέων ὄντων , ἐν οἷς οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὐκ ἐδύναντο διώκειν ὅπλα ἔχοντες .
but the irregulars, on whatever point they ran up and charged them most closely, they routed; and these again would retreat, and still defend themselves, being lightly equipped, and easily getting a good start in their flight, from the difficult nature of the ground, and its rough condition through being before uninhabited, over which the Lacedaemonians with their heavy armour could not pursue them.


4.34.1
2760
χρόνον μὲν οὖν τινὰ ὀλίγον οὕτω πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἠκροβολίσαντο ·
For some short time then they skirmished with each other in this way.


4.34.1
2761
τῶν δὲ Λακεδαιμονίων οὐκέτι ὀξέως ἐπεκθεῖν ᾗ προσπίπτοιεν δυναμένων , γνόντες αὐτοὺς οἱ ψιλοὶ βραδυτέρους ἤδη ὄντας τῷ ἀμύνασθαι , καὶ αὐτοὶ τῇ τε ὄψει τοῦ θαρσεῖν τὸ πλεῖστον εἰληφότες πολλαπλάσιοι φαινόμενοι καὶ ξυνειθισμένοι μᾶλλον μηκέτι δεινοὺς αὐτοὺς ὁμοίως σφίσι φαίνεσθαι , ὅτι οὐκ εὐθὺς ἄξια τῆς προσδοκίας ἐπεπόνθεσαν , ὥσπερ ὅτε πρῶτον ἀπέβαινον τῇ γνώμῃ δεδουλωμένοι ὡς ἐπὶ Λακεδαιμονίους , καταφρονήσαντες καὶ ἐμβοήσαντες ἁθρόοι ὥρμησαν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔβαλλον λίθοις τε καὶ τοξεύμασι καὶ ἀκοντίοις , ὡς ἕκαστός τι πρόχειρον εἶχεν .
When the Lacedaemonians could no longer make a quick charge upon them where they attacked, the light-armed troops, perceiving that they were now slower in defending themselves, and being greatly emboldened both by their superior numbers and by their greater confidence, as they appeared less formidable to them, seeing that they had not immediately inflicted injuries corresponding to their expectations, as when they first landed, thinking as they did that they were coming against Lacedaemonians, despised them, raised a shout, and with all their forces rushed upon them and attacked them with stones, arrows, and javelins, as each had in hand.


4.34.2
2762
γενομένης δὲ τῆς βοῆς ἅμα τῇ ἐπιδρομῇ ἔκπληξίς τε ἐνέπεσεν ἀνθρώποις ἀήθεσι τοιαύτης μάχης καὶ ὁ κονιορτὸς τῆς ὕλης νεωστὶ κεκαυμένης ἐχώρει πολὺς ἄνω , ἄπορόν τε ἦν ἰδεῖν τὸ πρὸ αὑτοῦ ὑπὸ τῶν τοξευμάτων καὶ λίθων ἀπὸ πολλῶν ἀνθρώπων μετὰ τοῦ κονιορτοῦ ἅμα φερομένων .
From the shouting thus raised, while they ran upon them, bewilderment seized them, as men unaccustomed to such a mode of fighting. The dust also from the wood that had been burnt was rising thick into the air, and it was impossible for any one to see before him, for the arrows and stones which, together with the dust, were flying from such a host of men.


4.34.3
2763
τό τε ἔργον ἐνταῦθα χαλεπὸν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καθίστατο ·
And here the action became distressing to the Lacedaemonians;


4.34.3
2764
οὔτε γὰρ οἱ πῖλοι ἔστεγον τὰ τοξεύματα , δοράτιά τε ἐναπεκέκλαστο βαλλομένων , εἶχόν τε οὐδὲν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς χρήσασθαι ἀποκεκλῃμένοι μὲν τῇ ὄψει τοῦ προορᾶν , ὑπὸ δὲ τῆς μείζονος βοῆς τῶν πολεμίων τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς παραγγελλόμενα οὐκ ἐσακούοντες , κινδύνου τε πανταχόθεν περιεστῶτος καὶ οὐκ ἔχοντες ἐλπίδα καθ’ ὅτι χρὴ ἀμυνομένους σωθῆναι .
for their caps were not proof against the arrows, and darts were broken in them, when they were struck; and they could make no use of their weapons, being excluded, so far as sight was concerned, from any view before them; and not hearing, for the louder shouts of the enemy, their own word of command, while danger surrounded them on every side, and they had no hope of any means of defending and saving themselves.


4.35.1
2765
τέλος δὲ τραυματιζομένων ἤδη πολλῶν διὰ τὸ αἰεὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ἀναστρέφεσθαι , ξυγκλῄσαντες ἐχώρησαν ἐς τὸ ἔσχατον ἔρυμα τῆς νήσου , ὃ οὐ πολὺ ἀπεῖχε , καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν φύλακας .
At last, when many were now being wounded from constantly moving in the same place, they formed into a close body, and went to the fort in the corner of the island, which was not far off, and to their own guards there.


4.35.2
2766
ὡς δὲ ἐνέδοσαν , ἐνταῦθα ἤδη πολλῷ ἔτι πλέονι βοῇ τεθαρσηκότες οἱ ψιλοὶ ἐπέκειντο , καὶ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ὅσοι μὲν ὑποχωροῦντες ἐγκατελαμβάνοντο , ἀπέθνῃσκον , οἱ δὲ πολλοὶ διαφυγόντες ἐς τὸ ἔρυμα μετὰ τῶν ταύτῃ φυλάκων ἐτάξαντο παρὰ πᾶν ὡς ἀμυνούμενοι ᾗπερ ἦν ἐπίμαχον .
On their giving way, the light-armed then at once took courage, and pressed on them with a far louder shout than ever. Those of the Lacedaemonians then who were overtaken in the retreat were slain; but the greater part escaped to the fort, and with the garrison that was there ranged themselves all along it, to defend themselves where it was assailable.


4.35.3
2767
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπισπόμενοι περίοδον μὲν αὐτῶν καὶ κύκλωσιν χωρίου ἰσχύι οὐκ εἶχον , προσιόντες δὲ ἐξ ἐναντίας ὤσασθαι ἐπειρῶντο .
The Athenians, on coming up, could not surround and enclose them, owing to the natural strength of the place, but advanced in front, and endeavoured to force their position.


4.35.4
2768
καὶ χρόνον μὲν πολὺν καὶ τῆς ἡμέρας τὸ πλεῖστον ταλαιπωρούμενοι ἀμφότεροι ὑπό τε τῆς μάχης καὶ δίψης καὶ ἡλίου ἀντεῖχον , πειρώμενοι οἱ μὲν ἐξελάσασθαι ἐκ τοῦ μετεώρου , οἱ δὲ μὴ ἐνδοῦναι ·
And thus for a long time, indeed for the greater part of the day, though suffering from the battle, dust, and sun, both sides held out; the one striving to drive them from the high ground, the other not to give way;


4.35.4
2769
ῥᾷον δ’ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἠμύνοντο ἢ ἐν τῷ πρίν , οὐκ οὔσης σφῶν τῆς κυκλώσεως ἐς τὰ πλάγια .
and the Lacedaemonians now defended themselves more easily than before, as there was no surrounding them on the flanks.


4.36.1
2770
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἀπέραντον ἦν , προσελθὼν ὁ τῶν Μεσσηνίων στρατηγὸς Κλέωνι καὶ Δημοσθένει ἄλλως ἔφη πονεῖν σφᾶς ·
When the business was still undecided, the commander of the Messenians came to Cleon and Demosthenes, and told them that they were labouring in vain;


4.36.1
2771
εἰ δὲ βούλονται ἑαυτῷ δοῦναι τῶν τοξοτῶν μέρος τι καὶ τῶν ψιλῶν περιιέναι κατὰ νώτου αὐτοῖς ὁδῷ ᾗ ἂν αὐτὸς εὕρῃ , δοκεῖν βιάσεσθαι τὴν ἔφοδον .
but if they would give him a part of the bowmen and light-armed, to go round in their rear by a way that he should himself discover, he thought he could force the approach.


4.36.2
2772
λαβὼν δὲ ἃ ᾐτήσατο , ἐκ τοῦ ἀφανοῦς ὁρμήσας ὥστε μὴ ἰδεῖν ἐκείνους , κατὰ τὸ αἰεὶ παρεῖκον τοῦ κρημνώδους τῆς νήσου προσβαίνων , καὶ ᾗ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι χωρίου ἰσχύι πιστεύσαντες οὐκ ἐφύλασσον , χαλεπῶς τε καὶ μόλις περιελθὼν ἔλαθε , καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ μετεώρου ἐξαπίνης ἀναφανεὶς κατὰ νώτου αὐτῶν τοὺς μὲν τῷ ἀδοκήτῳ ἐξέπληξε , τοὺς δὲ ἃ προσεδέχοντο ἰδόντας πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐπέρρωσεν .
Having received what he asked for, he started from a point out of the enemy's sight, that they might not observe it, and, advancing wherever the precipitous side of the island allowed a passage, and where the Lacedaemonians, relying on the strength of the ground, kept no guard, with great labour and difficulty he got round unobserved, and suddenly appearing on the height in their rear, struck the enemy with dismay at the unexpected movement, and gave much greater confidence to his friends by the sight of what they were looking for.


4.36.3
2773
καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι βαλλόμενοί τε ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἤδη καὶ γιγνόμενοι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ξυμπτώματι , ὡς μικρὸν μεγάλῳ εἰκάσαι , τῷ ἐν Θερμοπύλαις , ἐκεῖνοί τε γὰρ τῇ ἀτραπῷ περιελθόντων τῶν Περσῶν διεφθάρησαν , οὗτοί τε ἀμφίβολοι ἤδη ὄντες οὐκέτι ἀντεῖχον , ἀλλὰ πολλοῖς τε ὀλίγοι μαχόμενοι καὶ ἀσθενείᾳ σωμάτων διὰ τὴν σιτοδείαν ὑπεχώρουν , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐκράτουν ἤδη τῶν ἐφόδων .
And now the Lacedaemonians were exposed to missiles on both sides, and reduced to the same result (to compare a small case with a great one) as that which happened at Thermopylae; for those troops were cut off through the Persians' getting round by the path; and these, being more assailed on all sides, no longer held their ground, but from fighting, as they were, a few against many, and from weakness of body through want of provisions, they began to retreat; and so the Athenians now commanded the approaches.


4.37.1
2774
γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Κλέων καὶ ὁ Δημοσθένης ὅτι , εἰ καὶ ὁποσονοῦν μᾶλλον ἐνδώσουσι , διαφθαρησομένους αὐτοὺς ὑπὸ τῆς σφετέρας στρατιᾶς , ἔπαυσαν τὴν μάχην καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν ἀπεῖρξαν , βουλόμενοι ἀγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς Ἀθηναίοις ζῶντας , εἴ πως τοῦ κηρύγματος ἀκούσαντες ἐπικλασθεῖεν τῇ γνώμῃ τὰ ὅπλα παραδοῦναι καὶ ἡσσηθεῖεν τοῦ παρόντος δεινοῦ .
Cleon and Demosthenes, aware that if they gave way even the least degree more, they would be destroyed by the Athenian forces, stopped the engagement, and kept their men off them, wishing to take them alive to Athens, if by any means, in accordance with their proposals, they might be induced to surrender their arms, and yield to their present danger.


4.37.2
2775
ἐκήρυξάν τε , εἰ βούλονται , τὰ ὅπλα παραδοῦναι καὶ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς Ἀθηναίοις ὥστε βουλεῦσαι ὅτι ἂν ἐκείνοις δοκῇ .
And so they sent a herald, to ask if they would surrender their arms and themselves to the Athenians, to be treated at their discretion.


4.38.1
2776
οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες παρῆκαν τὰς ἀσπίδας οἱ πλεῖστοι καὶ τὰς χεῖρας ἀνέσεισαν , δηλοῦντες προσίεσθαι τὰ κεκηρυγμένα .
On hearing this, the greater part of them lowered their shields, and waved their hands, to show that they accepted the proposal.


4.38.1
2777
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα γενομένης τῆς ἀνοκωχῆς ξυνῆλθον ἐς λόγους ὅ τε Κλέων καὶ ὁ Δημοσθένης καὶ ἐκείνων Στύφων ὁ Φάρακος , τῶν πρότερον ἀρχόντων τοῦ μὲν πρώτου τεθνηκότος Ἐπιτάδου , τοῦ δὲ μετ’ αὐτὸν Ἱππαγρέτου ἐφῃρημένου ἐν τοῖς νεκροῖς ἔτι ζῶντος κειμένου ὡς τεθνεῶτος , αὐτὸς τρίτος ἐφῃρημένος ἄρχειν κατὰ νόμον , εἴ τι ἐκεῖνοι πάσχοιεν .
After this, when the cessation of hostilities had taken place, a conference was held between Cleon and Demosthenes, and Styphon the son of Pharax, on the other side; for Epitadas, the first of their former commanders, had been killed, and Hippagretas, the next in command, was lying amongst the slain, still alive, but given up for dead; and Styphon had been chosen, according to custom, to take the command in case of anything happening to them.


4.38.2
2778
ἔλεγε δὲ ὁ Στύφων καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ ὅτι βούλονται διακηρυκεύσασθαι πρὸς τοὺς ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ Λακεδαιμονίους ὅτι χρὴ σφᾶς ποιεῖν .
He, then, and those who were with him, said that they wished to send a herald to the Lacedaemonians on the mainland, and ask what they should do.


4.38.3
2779
καὶ ἐκείνων μὲν οὐδένα ἀφέντων , αὐτῶν δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων καλούντων ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου κήρυκας καὶ γενομένων ἐπερωτήσεων δὶς ἢ τρίς , ὁ τελευταῖος διαπλεύσας αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου Λακεδαιμονίων ἀνὴρ ἀπήγγειλεν ὅτι οἱ &quot; Λακεδαιμόνιοι κελεύουσιν ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς περὶ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν βουλεύεσθαι μηδὲν αἰσχρὸν ποιοῦντασ’ ·
When the Athenians would not allow any of them to leave the island, but themselves called for heralds from the mainland; and when questions had passed between them twice or thrice, the last man that came over to them from the Lacedaemonians on the mainland brought them this message; "The Lacedaemonians bid you to provide for your own interests, so long as you do nothing dishonourable."


4.38.3
2780
οἱ δὲ καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς βουλευσάμενοι τὰ ὅπλα παρέδοσαν καὶ σφᾶς αὐτούς .
So after consulting by themselves, they surrendered their arms and their persons.


4.38.4
2781
καὶ ταύτην μὲν τὴν ἡμέραν καὶ τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν νύκτα ἐν φυλακῇ εἶχον αὐτοὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ·
That day and the following night the Athenians kept them in custody;


4.38.4
2782
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι τροπαῖον στήσαντες ἐν τῇ νήσῳ τ- ἄλλα διεσκευάζοντο ὡς ἐς πλοῦν , καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοῖς τριηράρχοις διεδίδοσαν ἐς φυλακήν , οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι κήρυκα πέμψαντες τοὺς νεκροὺς διεκομίσαντο .
but the next day, after erecting a trophy on the island, they made all their other arrangements for sailing, and distributed the men amongst the captains of the fleet, to take charge of; while the Lacedaemonians sent a herald, and recovered their dead.


4.38.5
2783
ἀπέθανον δ’ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ καὶ ζῶντες ἐλήφθησαν τοσοίδε ·
Now the number of those who were killed in the island, or were taken alive, was as follows.


4.38.5
2784
εἴκοσι μὲν ὁπλῖται διέβησαν καὶ τετρακόσιοι οἱ πάντες ·
There had crossed over in all four hundred and twenty heavy-armed,


4.38.5
2785
τούτων ζῶντες ἐκομίσθησαν ὀκτὼ ἀποδέοντες τριακόσιοι , οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ἀπέθανον .
two hundred and ninety-two of which were taken [to Athens] alive, and the rest were slain.


4.38.5
2786
καὶ Σπαρτιᾶται τούτων ἦσαν τῶν ζώντων περὶ εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατόν .
Of those that were living about one hundred and twenty were Spartans.


4.38.5
2787
Ἀθηναίων δὲ οὐ πολλοὶ διεφθάρησαν ·
On the side of the Athenians there were not many killed;


4.38.5
2788
ἡ γὰρ μάχη οὐ σταδαία ἦν .
for the battle was not fought hand to hand.


4.39.1
2789
χρόνος δὲ ὁ ξύμπας ἐγένετο ὅσον οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ἐπολιορκήθησαν , ἀπὸ τῆς ναυμαχίας μέχρι τῆς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ μάχης , ἑβδομήκοντα ἡμέραι καὶ δύο .
The whole length of time that the men were blockaded, from the sea-fight to the battle in the island, was seventy-two days; for about twenty of which, whilst the ambassadors were gone to treat of peace, they had provisions given;


4.39.2
2790
τούτων περὶ εἴκοσιν ἡμέρας , ἐν αἷς οἱ πρέσβεις περὶ τῶν σπονδῶν ἀπῇσαν , ἐσιτοδοτοῦντο , τὰς δὲ ἄλλας τοῖς ἐσπλέουσι λάθρᾳ διετρέφοντο .
But for the remainder, they were fed by those that sailed in by stealth.


4.39.2
2791
καὶ ἦν σῖτός τις ἐν τῇ νήσῳ καὶ ἄλλα βρώματα ἐγκατελήφθη ·
And there was still corn in the island, and other kinds of food were found in it;


4.39.2
2792
ὁ γὰρ ἄρχων Ἐπιτάδας ἐνδεεστέρως ἑκάστῳ παρεῖχεν ἢ πρὸς τὴν ἐξουσίαν .
for Epitadas, the commander, supplied them with it more sparingly than he might have done.


4.39.3
2793
οἱ μὲν δὴ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἀνεχώρησαν τῷ στρατῷ ἐκ τῆς Πύλου ἑκάτεροι ἐπ’ οἴκου , καὶ τοῦ Κλέωνος καίπερ μανιώδης οὖσα ἡ ὑπόσχεσις ἀπέβη ·
The Athenians then and the Peloponnesians returned with their forces from Pylus to their several homes, and Cleon's promise, though a mad one, was fulfilled;


4.39.3
2794
ἐντὸς γὰρ εἴκοσιν ἡμερῶν ἤγαγε τοὺς ἄνδρας , ὥσπερ ὑπέστη .
for within twenty days he took the men to Athens, as he engaged to do.


4.40.1
2795
παρὰ γνώμην τε δὴ μάλιστα τῶν κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον τοῦτο τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἐγένετο ·
And of all the events of the war this happened most to the surprise of the Greeks;


4.40.1
2796
τοὺς γὰρ Λακεδαιμονίους οὔτε λιμῷ οὔτ’ ἀνάγκῃ οὐδεμιᾷ ἠξίουν τὰ ὅπλα παραδοῦναι , ἀλλὰ ἔχοντας καὶ μαχομένους ὡς ἐδύναντο ἀποθνῄσκειν .
for their opinion of the Lacedaemonians was, that neither for famine nor any other form of necessity would they surrender their arms, but would keep them, and fight as they could, till they were killed.


4.40.2
2797
ἀπιστοῦντές τε μὴ εἶναι τοὺς παραδόντας τοῖς τεθνεῶσιν ὁμοίους , καί τινος ἐρομένου ποτὲ ὕστερον τῶν Ἀθηναίων ξυμμάχων δι’ ἀχθηδόνα ἕνα τῶν ἐκ τῆς νήσου αἰχμαλώτων εἰ οἱ τεθνεῶτες αὐτῶν καλοὶ κ- ἀγαθοί , ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ πολλοῦ ἂν ἄξιον εἶναι τὸν ἄτρακτον , λέγων τὸν οἰστόν , εἰ τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς διεγίγνωσκε , δήλωσιν ποιούμενος ὅτι ὁ ἐντυγχάνων τοῖς τε λίθοις καὶ τοξεύμασι διεφθείρετο .
Indeed they did not believe that those who had surrendered were men of the same stamp with those who had fallen; and thus one of the allies of the Athenians some time after asked one of the prisoners from the island, by way of insult, if those of them who had fallen were honourable and brave men? to which he answered, that the (meaning the arrow) would be worth a great deal, if it knew the brave men from the rest; thus stating the fact, that any one was killed who came in the way of the stones and arrows.


4.41.1
2798
κομισθέντων δὲ τῶν ἀνδρῶν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐβούλευσαν δεσμοῖς μὲν αὐτοὺς φυλάσσειν μέχρι οὗ τι ξυμβῶσιν , ἢν δ’ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι πρὸ τούτου ἐς τὴν γῆν ἐσβάλωσιν , ἐξαγαγόντες ἀποκτεῖναι .
On the arrival of the men, the Athenians determined to keep them in prison, fill some arrangement should be made; and if the Lacedaemonians should before that invade their territory, to take them out and put them to death.


4.41.2
2799
τῆς δὲ Πύλου φυλακὴν κατεστήσαντο , καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Ναυπάκτου Μεσσήνιοι ὡς ἐς πατρίδα ταύτην ( ἔστι γὰρ ἡ Πύλος τῆς Μεσσηνίδος ποτὲ οὔσης γῆς ) πέμψαντες σφῶν αὐτῶν τοὺς ἐπιτηδειοτάτους ἐλῄζοντό τε τὴν Λακωνικὴν καὶ πλεῖστα ἔβλαπτον ὁμόφωνοι ὄντες .
They also arranged for the defence of Pylus; and the Messenians of Naupactus sent to the place, as to the land of their fathers, (for Pylus is a part of what was formerly the Messenian country,) such of their men as were most fit for the service, and plundered Laconia, and annoyed them most seriously by means of their common dialect.


4.41.3
2800
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀμαθεῖς ὄντες ἐν τῷ πρὶν χρόνῳ λῃστείας καὶ τοῦ τοιούτου πολέμου , τῶν τε Εἱλώτων αὐτομολούντων καὶ φοβούμενοι μὴ καὶ ἐπὶ μακρότερον σφίσι τι νεωτερισθῇ τῶν κατὰ τὴν χώραν , οὐ ῥᾳδίως ἔφερον , ἀλλὰ καίπερ οὐ βουλόμενοι ἔνδηλοι εἶναι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐπρεσβεύοντο παρ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπειρῶντο τήν τε Πύλον καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας κομίζεσθαι .
The Lacedaemonians having had no experience aforetime in such a predatory kind of warfare, and finding their Helots deserting, and fearing that they might see their country revolutionized to even a still greater extent, were not easy under it; but, although unwilling to show this to the Athenians, they sent ambassadors to them, and endeavoured to recover Pylus and the men.


4.41.4
2801
οἱ δὲ μειζόνων τε ὠρέγοντο καὶ πολλάκις φοιτώντων αὐτοὺς ἀπράκτους ἀπέπεμπον .
They, however, were grasping at greater advantages, and though they often went to them, sent them back without effecting any thing.


4.41.4
2802
ταῦτα μὲν τὰ περὶ Πύλον γενόμενα .
These then were the things that happened about Pylus.


4.42.1
2803
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους μετὰ ταῦτα εὐθὺς Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὴν Κορινθίαν ἐστράτευσαν ναυσὶν ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ δισχιλίοις ὁπλίταις ἑαυτῶν καὶ ἐν ἱππαγωγοῖς ναυσὶ διακοσίοις ἱππεῦσιν ·
The same summer, immediately after these events, the Athenians made an expedition against the Corinthian territory with eighty ships, two thousand heavy-armed of their own people, and two hundred cavalry on board horse-transports;


4.42.1
2804
ἠκολούθουν δὲ καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων Μιλήσιοι καὶ Ἄνδριοι καὶ Καρύστιοι , ἐστρατήγει δὲ Νικίας ὁ Νικηράτου τρίτος αὐτός .
the Milesians, Andrians, and Carystians, from amongst the allies, accompanying them, and Nicias the son of Niceratus taking the command, with two colleagues.


4.42.2
2805
πλέοντες δὲ ἅμα ἕῳ ἔσχον μεταξὺ Χερσονήσου τε καὶ Ῥείτου ἐς τὸν αἰγιαλὸν τοῦ χωρίου ὑπὲρ οὗ ὁ Σολύγειος λόφος ἐστίν , ἐφ’ ὃν Δωριῆς τὸ πάλαι ἱδρυθέντες τοῖς ἐν τῇ πόλει Κορινθίοις ἐπολέμουν οὖσιν Αἰολεῦσιν ·
Setting sail, they made land in the morning between the Chersonesus and Rheitus, on the beach adjoining to the spot above which is the Solygian hill, on which the Dorians in early times established themselves, and carried on war against the Corinthians in the city, who were Aeolians;


4.42.2
2806
καὶ κώμη νῦν ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ Σολύγεια καλουμένη ἐστίν .
and on which there now stands a village called Solygia.


4.42.2
2807
ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ αἰγιαλοῦ τούτου ἔνθα αἱ νῆες κατέσχον ἡ μὲν κώμη αὕτη δώδεκα σταδίους ἀπέχει , ἡ δὲ Κορινθίων πόλις ἑξήκοντα , ὁ δὲ Ἰσθμὸς εἴκοσι .
From this beach, where the ships came to land, the village is twelve stades off, the city of Corinth sixty, and the Isthmus twenty.


4.42.3
2808
Κορίνθιοι δὲ προπυθόμενοι ἐξ Ἄργους ὅτι ἡ στρατιὰ ἥξει τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ἐκ πλείονος ἐβοήθησαν ἐς Ἰσθμὸν πάντες πλὴν τῶν ἔξω Ἰσθμοῦ ·
The Corinthians, having heard long before from Argos that the armament of the Athenians was coming, went with succours to the Isthmus, all but those who lived above it:


4.42.3
2809
καὶ ἐν Ἀμπρακίᾳ καὶ ἐν Λευκάδι ἀπῆσαν αὐτῶν πεντακόσιοι φρουροί ·
there were absent too in Ambracia and Leucadia five hundred of them, serving as a garrison;


4.42.3
2810
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι πανδημεὶ ἐπετήρουν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οἷ κατασχήσουσιν .
but the rest, with all their forces, were watching where the Athenians would make the land.


4.42.4
2811
ὡς δὲ αὐτοὺς ἔλαθον νυκτὸς καταπλεύσαντες καὶ τὰ σημεῖα αὐτοῖς ἤρθη , καταλιπόντες τοὺς ἡμίσεις αὐτῶν ἐν Κεγχρειᾷ , ἢν ἄρα οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ τὸν Κρομμυῶνα ἴωσιν , ἐβοήθουν κατὰ τάχος .
But when they had come to during the night unobserved by them, and the appointed signals were raised to tell them of the fact, they left half their forces at Cenchreae, in case the Athenians should advance against Crommyon, and went to the rescue with all speed.


4.43.1
2812
καὶ Βάττος μὲν ὁ ἕτερος τῶν στρατηγῶν ( δύο γὰρ ἦσαν ἐν τῇ μάχῃ οἱ παρόντες ) λαβὼν λόχον ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν Σολύγειαν κώμην φυλάξων ἀτείχιστον οὖσαν , Λυκόφρων δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις ξυνέβαλεν .
And Battus, one of the generals, (for there were two present in the engagement,) took a battalion, and went to the village of Solygia to defend it, as it was unwalled; while Lycophron gave them battle with the rest.


4.43.2
2813
καὶ πρῶτα μὲν τῷ δεξιῷ κέρᾳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων εὐθὺς ἀποβεβηκότι πρὸ τῆς Χερσονήσου οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἐπέκειντο , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τῷ ἄλλῳ στρατεύματι .
First, the Corinthians attacked the right wing of the Athenians, immediately after it had landed in front of Chersonesus; then the rest of their army also.


4.43.2
2814
καὶ ἦν ἡ μάχη καρτερὰ καὶ ἐν χερσὶ πᾶσα .
And the battle was an obstinate one, and fought entirely hand to hand.


4.43.3
2815
καὶ τὸ μὲν δεξιὸν κέρας τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ Καρυστίων ( οὗτοι γὰρ παρατεταγμένοι ἦσαν ἔσχατοι ) ἐδέξαντό τε τοὺς Κορινθίους καὶ ἐώσαντο μόλις ·
The right wing of the Athenians and Carystians (for these had been posted in the extremity of the line) received the charge of the Corinthians, and drove them back after some trouble;


4.43.3
2816
οἱ δὲ ὑποχωρήσαντες πρὸς αἱμασιάν ( ἦν γὰρ τὸ χωρίον πρόσαντες πᾶν ) βάλλοντες τοῖς λίθοις καθύπερθεν ὄντες καὶ παιανίσαντες ἐπῇσαν αὖθις , δεξαμένων δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐν χερσὶν ἦν πάλιν ἡ μάχη .
but after retreating to a wall (for the ground was all on a rise) they assailed them with stones from the higher ground, and singing the paean, returned to the attack; which being received by the Athenians, the battle was again fought hand to hand.


4.43.4
2817
λόχος δέ τις τῶν Κορινθίων ἐπιβοηθήσας τῷ εὐωνύμῳ κέρᾳ ἑαυτῶν ἔτρεψε τῶν Ἀθηναίων τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας καὶ ἐπεδίωξεν ἐς τὴν θάλασσαν ·
Meanwhile a battalion of the Corinthians, having gone to the relief of their left wing, broke the right of the Athenians, and pursued them to the sea;


4.43.4
2818
πάλιν δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν ἀνέστρεψαν οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ Καρύστιοι .
but the Athenians and Carystians from the ships drove them back again.


4.43.5
2819
τὸ δὲ ἄλλο στρατόπεδον ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐμάχετο ξυνεχῶς , μάλιστα δὲ τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας τῶν Κορινθίων , ἐφ’ ᾧ ὁ Λυκόφρων ὢν κατὰ τὸ εὐώνυμον τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἠμύνετο ·
The rest of the army on both sides was fighting without cessation, especially the right wing of the Corinthians, in which Lycophron was opposed to the left of the Athenians, and acting on the defensive;


4.43.5
2820
ἤλπιζον γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν Σολύγειαν κώμην πειράσειν .
for they expected them to try for the village of Solygia.


4.44.1
2821
χρόνον μὲν οὖν πολὺν ἀντεῖχον οὐκ ἐνδιδόντες ἀλλήλοις ·
For a long time then they held out without yielding to each other;


4.44.1
2822
ἔπειτα ( ἦσαν γὰρ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις οἱ ἱππῆς ὠφέλιμοι ξυμμαχόμενοι , τῶν ἑτέρων οὐκ ἐχόντων ἵππους ) ἐτράποντο οἱ Κορίνθιοι καὶ ὑπεχώρησαν πρὸς τὸν λόφον καὶ ἔθεντο τὰ ὅπλα καὶ οὐκέτι κατέβαινον , ἀλλ’ ἡσύχαζον .
but afterwards (the Athenians having a serviceable force on their side in their cavalry, while the others had no horse) the Corinthians turned and retired to the hill, where they piled their arms, and did not come down again, but remained quiet.


4.44.2
2823
ἐν δὲ τῇ τροπῇ ταύτῃ κατὰ τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας οἱ πλεῖστοί τε αὐτῶν ἀπέθανον καὶ Λυκόφρων ὁ στρατηγός .
It was in this rout of the right wing that the greater part of them fell, and Lycophron their general.


4.44.2
2824
ἡ δὲ ἄλλη στρατιὰ τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ οὐ κατὰ δίωξιν πολλὴν οὐδὲ ταχείας φυγῆς γενομένης , ἐπεὶ ἐβιάσθη , ἐπαναχωρήσασα πρὸς τὰ μετέωρα ἱδρύθη .
The rest of the army, whose flight, when it was broken, was effected in this manner—with neither hot pursuit nor hurry—withdrew to the higher ground, and there took up its position.


4.44.3
2825
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὡς οὐκέτι αὐτοῖς ἐπῇσαν ἐς μάχην , τούς τε νεκροὺς ἐσκύλευον καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν ἀνῃροῦντο , τροπαῖόν τε εὐθέως ἔστησαν .
The Athenians, finding that they no longer advanced to engage them, spoiled the dead, and took up their own, and immediately erected a trophy.


4.44.4
2826
τοῖς δ’ ἡμίσεσι τῶν Κορινθίων , οἳ ἐν τῇ Κεγχρειᾷ ἐκάθηντο φύλακες μὴ ἐπὶ τὸν Κρομμυῶνα πλεύσωσι , τούτοις οὐ κατάδηλος ἡ μάχη ἦν ὑπὸ τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Ὀνείου ·
But to that half of the Corinthians which had been posted at Cenchreae for protection, lest the enemy should sail against Crommyon, the battle was not visible, owing to [an intervening ridge of] Mount Oneum;


4.44.4
2827
κονιορτὸν δὲ ὡς εἶδον καὶ ὡς ἔγνωσαν , ἐβοήθουν εὐθύς .
but when they saw dust, and were aware of it, they immediately went to the scene of action;


4.44.4
2828
ἐβοήθησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως πρεσβύτεροι τῶν Κορινθίων αἰσθόμενοι τὸ γεγενημένον .
as also did the older Corinthians from the city, when they found what had been done.


4.44.5
2829
ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ξύμπαντας αὐτοὺς ἐπιόντας καὶ νομίσαντες τῶν ἐγγὺς ἀστυγειτόνων Πελοποννησίων βοήθειαν ἐπιέναι , ἀνεχώρουν κατὰ τάχος ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς , ἔχοντες τὰ σκυλεύματα καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκροὺς πλὴν δυοῖν , οὓς ἐγκατέλιπον οὐ δυνάμενοι εὑρεῖν .
The Athenians, seeing them coming all together against them, and thinking that reinforcements were being brought by the neighbouring Peloponnesians, retreated with all speed to their ships, with the spoils and their own dead, except two whom they had left on the field because they could not find them.


4.44.6
2830
καὶ ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐπεραιώθησαν ἐς τὰς ἐπικειμένας νήσους , ἐκ δ’ αὐτῶν ἐπικηρυκευσάμενοι τοὺς νεκροὺς οὓς ἐγκατέλιπον ὑποσπόνδους ἀνείλοντο .
Having gone on board their ships, they crossed over to the islands that lie off the coast, and from them sent a herald, and took up under truce the bodies they had left behind them.


4.44.6
2831
ἀπέθανον δὲ Κορινθίων μὲν ἐν τῇ μάχῃ δώδεκα καὶ διακόσιοι , Ἀθηναίων δὲ ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους πεντήκοντα .
There were killed in the battle, on the side of the Corinthians, two hundred and twelve; of the Athenians, rather less than fifty.


4.45.1
2832
ἄραντες δὲ ἐκ τῶν νήσων οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔπλευσαν αὐθημερὸν ἐς Κρομμυῶνα τῆς Κορινθίας ·
Putting out from the islands, the Athenians sailed the same day to Crommyon in the Corinthian territory,


4.45.1
2833
ἀπέχει δὲ τῆς πόλεως εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν σταδίους .
distant from the city one hundred and twenty stades,


4.45.1
2834
καὶ καθορμισάμενοι τήν τε γῆν ἐδῄωσαν καὶ τὴν νύκτα ηὐλίσαντο .
and having come to their moorings, ravaged the land, and passed the night there.


4.45.2
2835
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ παραπλεύσαντες ἐς τὴν Ἐπιδαυρίαν πρῶτον καὶ ἀπόβασίν τινα ποιησάμενοι ἀφίκοντο ἐς Μέθανα τὴν μεταξὺ Ἐπιδαύρου καὶ Τροιζῆνος , καὶ ἀπολαβόντες τὸν τῆς χερσονήσου ἰσθμὸν ἐτείχισαν , ἐν ᾧ ἡ Μεθώνη ἐστί , καὶ φρούριον καταστησάμενοι ἐλῄστευον τὸν ἔπειτα χρόνον τήν τε Τροιζηνίαν γῆν καὶ Ἁλιάδα καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίαν .
The next day, having first coasted along to the Epidaurian territory and made a descent upon it, they came to Methone, which stands between Epidaurus and Troezen;


4.45.2
2836
ταῖς δὲ ναυσίν , ἐπειδὴ ἐξετείχισαν τὸ χωρίον , ἀπέπλευσαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
and cutting off the isthmus of the peninsula in which Methone is situated, they fortified it, and having made it a post for a garrison, continued afterwards to lay waste the land of Troezen, Haliae, and Epidaurus. After cutting off this spot by a wall, they sailed back home with their ships.


4.46.1
2837
κατὰ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον , καθ’ ὃν ταῦτα ἐγίγνετο , καὶ Εὐρυμέδων καὶ Σοφοκλῆς , ἐπειδὴ ἐκ τῆς Πύλου ἀπῆραν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν ναυσὶν Ἀθηναίων , ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Κέρκυραν ἐστράτευσαν μετὰ τῶν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῆς Ἰστώνης Κερκυραίων καθιδρυμένους , οἳ τότε μετὰ τὴν στάσιν διαβάντες ἐκράτουν τε τῆς γῆς καὶ πολλὰ ἔβλαπτον .
At the same time that these things were being done, Eurymedon and Sophocles, after weighing from Pylus for Sicily with an Athenian squadron, came to Corcyra, and with the Corcyraeans in the city carried on war upon those that had established themselves on Mount Istone, and who at that time, after crossing over subsequently to the insurrection, commanded the country, and were doing them much damage.


4.46.2
2838
προσβαλόντες δὲ τὸ μὲν τείχισμα εἷλον , οἱ δὲ ἄνδρες καταπεφευγότες ἁθρόοι πρὸς μετέωρόν τι ξυνέβησαν ὥστε τοὺς μὲν ἐπικούρους παραδοῦναι , περὶ δὲ σφῶν τὰ ὅπλα παραδόντων τὸν Ἀθηναίων δῆμον διαγνῶναι .
They attacked their strong-hold and took it, but the men, having escaped in a body to a higher eminence, surrendered on condition of giving up their auxiliaries, and letting the Athenian people decide their own fate, after they had given up their arms. So the generals carried them across under truce to the island of Ptychia, to be kept in custody until they were sent to Athens;


4.46.3
2839
καὶ αὐτοὺς ἐς τὴν νῆσον οἱ στρατηγοὶ τὴν Πτυχίαν ἐς φυλακὴν διεκόμισαν ὑποσπόνδους , μέχρι οὗ Ἀθήναζε πεμφθῶσιν , ὥστ’ , ἐάν τις ἁλῷ ἀποδιδράσκων , ἅπασι λελύσθαι τὰς σπονδάς .
with an understanding that if any one were caught running away, the treaty would be void in the case of all.


4.46.4
2840
οἱ δὲ τοῦ δήμου προστάται τῶν Κερκυραίων , δεδιότες μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς ἐλθόντας οὐκ ἀποκτείνωσι , μηχανῶνται τοιόνδε τι ·
But the leaders of the popular party at Corcyra, fearing. that the Athenians might not put to death those that were sent to them, contrive the following stratagem.


4.46.5
2841
τῶν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ πείθουσί τινας ὀλίγους , ὑποπέμψαντες φίλους καὶ διδάξαντες ὡς κατ’ εὔνοιαν δὴ λέγειν ὅτι κράτιστον αὐτοῖς εἴη ὡς τάχιστα ἀποδρᾶναι , πλοῖον δέ τι αὐτοὶ ἑτοιμάσειν ·
They persuade some few of the men in the island, by secretly sending friends to them, and instructing them to say, as though with a kind motive, that it was best for them to make their escape as quickly as possible, and that they would themselves get a vessel ready,


4.46.5
2842
μέλλειν γὰρ δὴ τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν Ἀθηναίων παραδώσειν αὐτοὺς τῷ δήμῳ τῶν Κερκυραίων .
for that the Athenian generals intended to give them up to the Corcyraean populace.


4.47.1
2843
ὡς δὲ ἔπεισαν , καὶ μηχανησαμένων τὸ πλοῖον ἐκπλέοντες ἐλήφθησαν , ἐλέλυντό τε αἱ σπονδαὶ καὶ τοῖς Κερκυραίοις παρεδίδοντο οἱ πάντες .
So when they had persuaded them, and through their own arrangements about the vessel the men were caught sailing away, the treaty was declared void, and the whole party given up to the Corcyraeans.


4.47.2
2844
ξυνελάβοντο δὲ τοῦ τοιούτου οὐχ ἥκιστα , ὥστε ἀκριβῆ τὴν πρόφασιν γενέσθαι καὶ τοὺς τεχνησαμένους ἀδεέστερον ἐγχειρῆσαι , οἱ στρατηγοὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων κατάδηλοι ὄντες τοὺς ἄνδρας μὴ ἂν βούλεσθαι ὑπ’ ἄλλων κομισθέντας , διότι αὐτοὶ ἐς Σικελίαν ἔπλεον , τὴν τιμὴν τοῖς ἄγουσι προσποιῆσαι .
And the Athenian generals contributed no small share to such a result—that the pretext seemed strictly true, and its contrivers took it in hand more securely—by showing that they would not wish the men to be conveyed to Athens by another party, (they themselves being bound for Sicily,) and so to confer the honour on those who took them there.


4.47.3
2845
παραλαβόντες δὲ αὐτοὺς οἱ Κερκυραῖοι ἐς οἴκημα μέγα κατεῖρξαν , καὶ ὕστερον ἐξάγοντες κατὰ εἴκοσιν ἄνδρας διῆγον διὰ δυοῖν στοίχοιν ὁπλιτῶν ἑκατέρωθεν παρατεταγμένων , δεδεμένους τε πρὸς ἀλλήλους καὶ παιομένους καὶ κεντουμένους ὑπὸ τῶν παρατεταγμένων , εἴ πού τίς τινα ἴδοι ἐχθρὸν ἑαυτοῦ ·
When the Corcyraeans had got possession of them, they shut them up in a large building, and afterwards taking them out by twenties, led them through two rows of heavy-armed soldiers posted on each side;


4.47.3
2846
μαστιγοφόροι τε παριόντες ἐπετάχυνον τῆς ὁδοῦ τοὺς σχολαίτερον προϊόντας .
the prisoners being bound together, and beaten and stabbed by the men ranged in the lines, wherever any of them happened to see a personal enemy; while men carrying whips went by their side, and hastened on the way those that were proceeding too slowly.


4.48.1
2847
καὶ ἐς μὲν ἄνδρας ἑξήκοντα ἔλαθον τοὺς ἐν τῷ οἰκήματι τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἐξαγαγόντες καὶ διαφθείραντες ( ᾤοντο γὰρ αὐτοὺς μεταστήσοντάς ποι ἄλλοσε ἄγειν ) ·
As many as sixty men they took out in this manner, and put to death without the knowledge of those in the building;


4.48.1
2848
ὡς δὲ ᾔσθοντο καί τις αὐτοῖς ἐδήλωσε , τούς τε Ἀθηναίους ἐπεκαλοῦντο καὶ ἐκέλευον σφᾶς , εἰ βούλονται , αὐτοὺς διαφθείρειν , ἔκ τε τοῦ οἰκήματος οὐκέτι ἤθελον ἐξιέναι , οὐδ’ ἐσιέναι ἔφασαν κατὰ δύναμιν περιόψεσθαι οὐδένα .
(for they supposed that they were taking them to be removed to some other place); but when they were aware of it, through some one's having pointed it out to them, they called on the Athenians, and desired that they would themselves put them to death, if they wished.


4.48.2
2849
οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι κατὰ μὲν τὰς θύρας οὐδ’ αὐτοὶ διενοοῦντο βιάζεσθαι , ἀναβάντες δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ τέγος τοῦ οἰκήματος καὶ διελόντες τὴν ὀροφὴν ἔβαλλον τῷ κεράμῳ καὶ ἐτόξευον κάτω .
They refused also any longer to leave the building, and said they would not, as far as they could prevent it, permit any one to come in. The Corcyraeans indeed were themselves not disposed to force a passage by the doors; but having gone up to the top of the building, and broken through the roof, they threw the tiles and discharged their arrows down on them.


4.48.3
2850
οἱ δὲ ἐφυλάσσοντό τε ὡς ἐδύναντο καὶ ἅμα οἱ πολλοὶ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς διέφθειρον , οἰστούς τε οὓς ἀφίεσαν ἐκεῖνοι ἐς τὰς σφαγὰς καθιέντες καὶ ἐκ κλινῶν τινῶν αἳ ἔτυχον αὐτοῖς ἐνοῦσαι τοῖς σπάρτοις καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἱματίων παραιρήματα ποιοῦντες ἀπαγχόμενοι , παντί τε τρόπῳ τὸ πολὺ τῆς νυκτός ( ἐπεγένετο γὰρ νὺξ τῷ παθήματι ) ἀναλοῦντες σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ βαλλόμενοι ὑπὸ τῶν ἄνω διεφθάρησαν .
The prisoners sheltered themselves as well as they could, while at the same time the greater part were dispatching themselves, by thrusting into their throats the arrows which their enemies discharged, and hanging themselves with the cords from some beds that happened to be in the place, and by making strips from their clothes; and so in every manner during the greater part of the night, (for night came on while the tragedy was acting,) they were destroying themselves, and were dispatched with missiles by those on the roof.


4.48.4
2851
καὶ αὐτοὺς οἱ Κερκυραῖοι , ἐπειδὴ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο , φορμηδὸν ἐπὶ ἁμάξας ἐπιβαλόντες ἀπήγαγον ἔξω τῆς πόλεως .
When it was day, the Corcyraeans threw them in layers on waggons, and carried them out of the city;


4.48.4
2852
τὰς δὲ γυναῖκας , ὅσαι ἐν τῷ τειχίσματι ἑάλωσαν , ἠνδραποδίσαντο .
while all the women that were taken in the building were reduced to slavery.


4.48.5
2853
τοιούτῳ μὲν τρόπῳ οἱ ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους Κερκυραῖοι ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου διεφθάρησαν , καὶ ἡ στάσις πολλὴ γενομένη ἐτελεύτησεν ἐς τοῦτο , ὅσα γε κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον τόνδε ·
In this way were the Corcyraeans of the mountain cut off by the commons;


4.48.5
2854
οὐ γὰρ ἔτι ἦν ὑπόλοιπον τῶν ἑτέρων ὅτι καὶ ἀξιόλογον .
and the sedition, after raging so violently, came to this termination, at least, as far as the present war is concerned; for of one of the two parties there was nothing left worth mentioning.


4.48.6
2855
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν , ἵναπερ τὸ πρῶτον ὥρμηντο , ἀποπλεύσαντες μετὰ τῶν ἐκεῖ ξυμμάχων ἐπολέμουν .
The Athenians then sailed away to Sicily, which was their original destination, and carried on the war with their allies there.


4.49.1
2856
καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Ναυπάκτῳ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνες ἅμα τελευτῶντος τοῦ θέρους στρατευσάμενοι Ἀνακτόριον Κορινθίων πόλιν , ἣ κεῖται ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ Ἀμπρακικοῦ κόλπου , ἔλαβον προδοσίᾳ ·
At the close of the summer, the Athenians at Naupactus and the Acarnanians made an expedition, and took Anactorium, a city belonging to the Corinthians, which is situated at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, and was betrayed to them.


4.49.1
2857
καὶ ἐκπέμψαντες Κορινθίους αὐτοὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνες οἰκήτορας ἀπὸ πάντων ἔσχον τὸ χωρίον .
And having turned out the Corinthians, Acarnanian settlers from all parts of the country themselves kept possession of the place.


4.49.1
2858
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And so the summer ended.


4.50.1
2859
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος Ἀριστείδης ὁ Ἀρχίππου , εἷς τῶν ἀργυρολόγων νεῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγός , αἳ ἐξεπέμφθησαν πρὸς τοὺς ξυμμάχους , Ἀρταφέρνην ἄνδρα Πέρσην παρὰ βασιλέως πορευόμενον ἐς Λακεδαίμονα ξυλλαμβάνει ἐν Ἠιόνι τῇ ἐπὶ Στρυμόνι .
The following winter Aristides son of Archippus, a commander of the Athenian ships which had been sent out to the allies to levy contributions, arrested at Eion on the Strymon Artaphernes, a Persian, on his way from the king to Lacedaemon.


4.50.2
2860
καὶ αὐτοῦ κομισθέντος οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰς μὲν ἐπιστολὰς μεταγραψάμενοι ἐκ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων γραμμάτων ἀνέγνωσαν , ἐν αἷς πολλῶν ἄλλων γεγραμμένων κεφάλαιον ἦν πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους , οὐ γιγνώσκειν ὅτι βούλονται ·
On his being conveyed to Athens, they got his despatches translated out of the Assyrian character, and read them: the substance of which, as regarded the Lacedaemonians, (though many other things were mentioned in them,) was, that the king did not understand what they would have;


4.50.2
2861
πολλῶν γὰρ ἐλθόντων πρέσβεων οὐδένα τ- αὐτὰ λέγειν ·
for though many ambassadors had come to him, no one ever made the same statement as another;


4.50.2
2862
εἰ οὖν τι βούλονται σαφὲς λέγειν , πέμψαι μετὰ τοῦ Πέρσου ἄνδρας ὡς αὐτόν .
if then they would but speak plainly, they might send men to him in company with this Persian.


4.50.3
2863
τὸν δὲ Ἀρταφέρνην ὕστερον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀποστέλλουσι τριήρει ἐς Ἔφεσον καὶ πρέσβεις ἅμα ·
The Athenians afterwards sent back Artaphernes in a trireme to Ephesus, and ambassadors with him;


4.50.3
2864
οἳ πυθόμενοι αὐτόθι βασιλέα Ἀρταξέρξην τὸν Ξέρξου νεωστὶ τεθνηκότα ( κατὰ γὰρ τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον ἐτελεύτησεν ) ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀνεχώρησαν .
but on hearing there that king Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes, was lately dead, (for it was at that time that he died,) they returned home.


4.51.1
2865
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος καὶ Χῖοι τὸ τεῖχος περιεῖλον τὸ καινὸν κελευσάντων Ἀθηναίων καὶ ὑποπτευσάντων ἐς αὐτούς τι νεωτεριεῖν , ποιησάμενοι μέντοι πρὸς Ἀθηναίους πίστεις καὶ βεβαιότητα ἐκ τῶν δυνατῶν μηδὲν περὶ σφᾶς νεώτερον βουλεύσειν .
The same winter also the Chians dismantled their new fortifications, at the command of the Athenians, and in consequence of their suspecting that they would form some new designs against them:


4.51.1
2866
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ ἕβδομον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
they obtained, however, pledges from the Athenians, and security (as far as they could) for their making no change in their treatment of them. And so the winter ended and the seventh year of this war, of which Thucydides wrote the history.


4.52.1
2867
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους εὐθὺς τοῦ τε ἡλίου ἐκλιπές τι ἐγένετο περὶ νουμηνίαν καὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ μηνὸς ἱσταμένου ἔσεισεν .
At the very commencement of the following summer, there was an eclipse of the sun at the time of a new moon, and in the early part of the same month an earthquake.


4.52.2
2868
καὶ οἱ Μυτιληναίων φυγάδες καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Λεσβίων , ὁρμώμενοι οἱ πολλοὶ ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου καὶ μισθωσάμενοι ἔκ τε Πελοποννήσου ἐπικουρικὸν καὶ αὐτόθεν ξυναγείραντες , αἱροῦσι Ῥοίτειον , καὶ λαβόντες δισχιλίους στατῆρας Φωκαΐτας ἀπέδοσαν πάλιν οὐδὲν ἀδικήσαντες ·
Moreover, the exiles of the the Mytilenaeans and the other Lesbians, setting out most of them from the continent, and having taken into their pay an auxiliary force from the Peloponnese, and raised troops from the neighbourhood, took Rhoeteum, but restored it without injury on the receipt of 2000 Phocaean staters.


4.52.3
2869
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἐπὶ Ἄντανδρον στρατεύσαντες προδοσίας γενομένης λαμβάνουσι τὴν πόλιν .
After this they marched against Antandrus, and took the town through the treachery of the inhabitants.


4.52.3
2870
καὶ ἦν αὐτῶν ἡ διάνοια τάς τε ἄλλας πόλεις τὰς Ἀκταίας καλουμένας , ἃς πρότερον Μυτιληναίων νεμομένων Ἀθηναῖοι εἶχον , ἐλευθεροῦν , καὶ πάντων μάλιστα τὴν Ἄντανδρον ·
And their design was to liberate both the other Actaean towns, as they were called—which the Athenians held, though formerly the Mytilenaeans owned them—and, above all, Antandrus;


4.52.3
2871
καὶ κρατυνάμενοι αὐτὴν ( ναῦς τε γὰρ εὐπορία ἦν ποιεῖσθαι , αὐτόθεν ξύλων ὑπαρχόντων καὶ τῆς Ἴδης ἐπικειμένης , καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ σκευῇ ) ῥᾳδίως ἀπ’ αὐτῆς ὁρμώμενοι τήν τε Λέσβον ἐγγὺς οὖσαν κακώσειν καὶ τὰ ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ Αἰολικὰ πολίσματα χειρώσεσθαι .
having fortified which, (for there were great facilities for building ships there, as there was a supply of timber, with Ida close at hand,) and sallying from it, as they easily might, with resources of every other kind, they purposed to ravage Lesbos, which lay near, and to subdue the Aeolian towns on the mainland.


4.52.3
2872
καὶ οἱ μὲν ταῦτα παρασκευάζεσθαι ἔμελλον .
Such were the preparations which they meant to make.


4.53.1
2873
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει ἑξήκοντα ναυσὶ καὶ δισχιλίοις ὁπλίταις ἱππεῦσί τε ὀλίγοις καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων Μιλησίους καὶ ἄλλους τινὰς ἀγαγόντες ἐστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Κύθηρα ·
The Athenians in the same summer made an expedition against Cythera, with sixty ships, two thousand heavy-armed, and a few cavalry, taking with them also from amongst the allies the Milesians and some others;


4.53.1
2874
ἐστρατήγει δὲ αὐτῶν Νικίας ὁ Νικηράτου καὶ Νικόστρατος ὁ Διειτρέφους καὶ Αὐτοκλῆς ὁ Τολμαίου .
under the command of Nicias son of Niceratus, Nicostratus son of Diotrephes, and Autocles son of Tolmaeus.


4.53.2
2875
τὰ δὲ Κύθηρα νῆσός ἐστιν , ἐπίκειται δὲ τῇ Λακωνικῇ κατὰ Μαλέαν ·
This Cythera is an island lying off Laconia, opposite to Malea.


4.53.2
2876
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δ’ εἰσὶ τῶν περιοίκων , καὶ κυθηροδίκης ἀρχὴ ἐκ τῆς Σπάρτης διέβαινεν αὐτόσε κατὰ ἔτος , ὁπλιτῶν τε φρουρὰν διέπεμπον αἰεὶ καὶ πολλὴν ἐπιμέλειαν ἐποιοῦντο .
The inhabitants are Laconians, of the class of the perioeci, and an officer called the Judge of Cythera went over to the place annually. They also sent over regularly a garrison of heavy-armed, and paid great attention to it.


4.53.3
2877
ἦν γὰρ αὐτοῖς τῶν τε ἀπ’ Αἰγύπτου καὶ Λιβύης ὁλκάδων προσβολή , καὶ λῃσταὶ ἅμα τὴν Λακωνικὴν ἧσσον ἐλύπουν ἐκ θαλάσσης , ᾗπερ μόνον οἷόν τε ἦν κακουργεῖσθαι ·
For it was their landing-place for the merchantmen from Egypt and Libya;


4.53.3
2878
πᾶσα γὰρ ἀνέχει πρὸς τὸ Σικελικὸν καὶ Κρητικὸν πέλαγος .
and at the same time privateers were less able to annoy Laconia from the sea, the only side on which it could be injured; for the whole of it runs out toward the Sicilian and Cretan seas.


4.54.1
2879
κατασχόντες οὖν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τῷ στρατῷ , δέκα μὲν ναυσὶ καὶ δισχιλίοις Μιλησίων ὁπλίταις τὴν ἐπὶ θαλάσσῃ πόλιν Σκάνδειαν καλουμένην αἱροῦσι , τῷ δὲ ἄλλῳ στρατεύματι ἀποβάντες τῆς νήσου ἐς τὰ πρὸς Μαλέαν τετραμμένα ἐχώρουν ἐπὶ τὴν ἐπὶ θαλάσσῃ πόλιν τῶν Κυθηρίων , καὶ ηὗρον εὐθὺς αὐτοὺς ἐστρατοπεδευμένους ἅπαντας .
The Athenians therefore, having made the land with their armament, with ten of their ships and two thousand heavy-armed of the Milesians, took the town on the coast called Scandea; while with the rest of their forces they landed on the side of the island looking towards Malea, and advanced against the lower town of Cythera, and at once found all the inhabitants encamped there.


4.54.2
2880
καὶ μάχης γενομένης ὀλίγον μέν τινα χρόνον ὑπέστησαν οἱ Κυθήριοι , ἔπειτα τραπόμενοι κατέφυγον ἐς τὴν ἄνω πόλιν , καὶ ὕστερον ξυνέβησαν πρὸς Νικίαν καὶ τοὺς ξυνάρχοντας Ἀθηναίοις ἐπιτρέψαι περὶ σφῶν αὐτῶν πλὴν θανάτου .
A battle having been fought, the Cytherians stood their ground for some short time, and then turned and fled into the upper town; after which they came to an agreement with Nicias and his colleagues to throw themselves on the mercy of the Athenians, only stipulating that they should not be put to death.


4.54.3
2881
ἦσαν δέ τινες καὶ γενόμενοι τῷ Νικίᾳ λόγοι πρότερον πρός τινας τῶν Κυθηρίων , δι’ ὃ καὶ θᾶσσον καὶ ἐπιτηδειότερον τό τε παραυτίκα καὶ τὸ ἔπειτα τὰ τῆς ὁμολογίας ἐπράχθη αὐτοῖς ·
Indeed there had been before certain proposals made by Nicias to some of the Cytherians, in consequence of which the terms of the capitulation were settled more quickly and favourably, both for their present and future interests:


4.54.3
2882
ἀνέστησαν γὰρ ἂν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι Κυθηρίους , Λακεδαιμονίους τε ὄντας καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ Λακωνικῇ τῆς νήσου οὕτως ἐπικειμένης .
else the Athenians would have expelled the Cytherians, both on the ground of their being Lacedaemonians and of the island being so adjacent to Laconia.


4.54.4
2883
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ξύμβασιν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τήν τε Σκάνδειαν τὸ ἐπὶ τῷ λιμένι πόλισμα παραλαβόντες καὶ τῶν Κυθήρων φυλακὴν ποιησάμενοι ἔπλευσαν ἔς τε Ἀσίνην καὶ Ἕλος καὶ τὰ πλεῖστα τῶν περὶ θάλασσαν , καὶ ἀποβάσεις ποιούμενοι καὶ ἐναυλιζόμενοι τῶν χωρίων οὗ καιρὸς εἴη ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν ἡμέρας μάλιστα ἑπτά .
After the capitulation, the Athenians, having got possession of Scandea, the town near the harbour, and appointed a garrison for Cythera, sailed to Asine, Helus, and most of the places on the sea; and making descents and passing the night on shore at such spots as were convenient, they continued ravaging the country about seven days.


4.55.1
2884
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἰδόντες μὲν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τὰ Κύθηρα ἔχοντας , προσδεχόμενοι δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν γῆν σφῶν ἀποβάσεις τοιαύτας ποιήσεσθαι , ἁθρόᾳ μὲν οὐδαμοῦ τῇ δυνάμει ἀντετάξαντο , κατὰ δὲ τὴν χώραν φρουρὰς διέπεμψαν , ὁπλιτῶν πλῆθος , ὡς ἑκασταχόσε ἔδει , καὶ τὰ ἄλλα ἐν φυλακῇ πολλῇ ἦσαν , φοβούμενοι μὴ σφίσι νεώτερόν τι γένηται τῶν περὶ τὴν κατάστασιν , γεγενημένου μὲν τοῦ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ πάθους ἀνελπίστου καὶ μεγάλου , Πύλου δὲ ἐχομένης καὶ Κυθήρων καὶ πανταχόθεν σφᾶς περιεστῶτος πολέμου ταχέος καὶ ἀπροφυλάκτου , ὥστε παρὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς ἱππέας τετρακοσίους κατεστήσαντο καὶ τοξότας , ἔς τε τὰ πολεμικά , εἴπερ ποτέ , μάλιστα δὴ ὀκνηρότεροι ἐγένοντο , ξυνεστῶτες παρὰ τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν σφῶν ἰδέαν τῆς παρασκευῆς ναυτικῷ ἀγῶνι , καὶ τούτῳ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους , οἷς τὸ μὴ ἐπιχειρούμενον αἰεὶ ἐλλιπὲς ἦν τῆς δοκήσεώς τι πράξειν ·
The Lacedaemonians, seeing the Athenians in possession of Cythera, and expecting them to make descents of this kind on their territory, no where opposed them with their collected forces, but sent about garrisons through the country, consisting of such numbers of heavy-armed as were required at the different places. And in other respects they were very cautious, fearing lest some innovation should be made in their constitution, in consequence of the unexpected and severe blow which had befallen them in the island, and of the occupation of Pylus and Cythera, and of their being surrounded on all sides by a war that was rapid and defied all precautions. So that, contrary to their custom, they raised four hundred horse and some bowmen;


4.55.3
2885
καὶ ἅμα τὰ τῆς τύχης πολλὰ καὶ ἐν ὀλίγῳ ξυμβάντα παρὰ λόγον αὐτοῖς ἔκπληξιν μεγίστην παρεῖχε , καὶ ἐδέδισαν μή ποτε αὖθις ξυμφορά τις αὐτοῖς περιτύχῃ οἵα καὶ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ .
At the same time the events of fortune, many of which had in a short space of time happened contrary to their expectation, caused them the greatest dismay; and they were afraid that some disaster like that in the island might again, some time or other, happen to them.


4.55.4
2886
ἀτολμότεροι δὲ δι’ αὐτὸ ἐς τὰς μάχας ἦσαν , καὶ πᾶν ὅτι κινήσειαν ᾤοντο ἁμαρτήσεσθαι διὰ τὸ τὴν γνώμην ἀνεχέγγυον γεγενῆσθαι ἐκ τῆς πρὶν ἀηθείας τοῦ κακοπραγεῖν .
And for this reason they had less courage for fighting, and thought that whatever movement they made they should do wrong; because their minds had lost all assurance, owing to their former inexperience in misfortune.


4.56.1
2887
τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις τότε τὴν παραθαλάσσιον δῃοῦσι τὰ μὲν πολλὰ ἡσύχασαν , ὡς καθ’ ἑκάστην φρουρὰν γίγνοιτό τις ἀπόβασις , πλήθει τε ἐλάσσους ἕκαστοι ἡγούμενοι εἶναι καὶ ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ ·
Accordingly, while the Athenians were at that time ravaging their sea-coast, whatever might be the garrison in the neighbourhood of which each descent was made, generally speaking they kept quiet, thinking themselves in each case too few to resist them, and from their present state of feeling.


4.56.1
2888
μία δὲ φρουρά , ἥπερ καὶ ἠμύνατο περὶ Κοτύρταν καὶ Ἀφροδιτίαν , τὸν μὲν ὄχλον τῶν ψιλῶν ἐσκεδασμένον ἐφόβησεν ἐπιδρομῇ , τῶν δὲ ὁπλιτῶν δεξαμένων ὑπεχώρησε πάλιν , καὶ ἄνδρες τέ τινες ἀπέθανον αὐτῶν ὀλίγοι καὶ ὅπλα ἐλήφθη , τροπαῖόν τε στήσαντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς Κύθηρα .
And one garrison which did offer resistance about Cotyrta and Aphrodisia, though it terrified by an attack the scattered crowd of light-armed, yet retreated again, on its charge being sustained by the heavy-armed; and some few men belonging to it were killed, and some arms were taken; and the Athenians raised a trophy, and then sailed back to Cythera.


4.56.2
2889
ἐκ δὲ αὐτῶν περιέπλευσαν ἐς Ἐπίδαυρον τὴν Λιμηράν , καὶ δῃώσαντες μέρος τι τῆς γῆς ἀφικνοῦνται ἐπὶ Θυρέαν , ἥ ἐστι μὲν τῆς Κυνουρίας γῆς καλουμένης , μεθορία δὲ τῆς Ἀργείας καὶ Λακωνικῆς ·
Thence they sailed round to the Limeran Epidaurus, and after laying waste some portion of the land, came to Thyrea, which forms a part of the Cynurian territory, as it is called, and is on the frontiers of Argos and Laconia.


4.56.2
2890
νεμόμενοι δὲ αὐτὴν ἔδοσαν Λακεδαιμόνιοι Αἰγινήταις ἐκπεσοῦσιν ἐνοικεῖν διά τε τὰς ὑπὸ τὸν σεισμὸν σφίσι γενομένας καὶ τῶν Εἱλώτων τὴν ἐπανάστασιν εὐεργεσίας καὶ ὅτι Ἀθηναίων ὑπακούοντες ὅμως πρὸς τὴν ἐκείνων γνώμην αἰεὶ ἕστασαν .
This district the Lacedaemonians, who owned it, gave to the Aeginetans, when expelled from their island, as a residence, for the service they had done them at the time of the earthquake and insurrection of the Helots, and because, though subject to Athens, they always stood on their side.


4.57.1
2891
προσπλεόντων οὖν ἔτι τῶν Ἀθηναίων οἱ Αἰγινῆται τὸ μὲν ἐπὶ τῇ θαλάσσῃ ὃ ἔτυχον οἰκοδομοῦντες τεῖχος ἐκλείπουσιν , ἐς δὲ τὴν ἄνω πόλιν , ἐν ᾗ ᾤκουν , ἀπεχώρησαν , ἀπέχουσαν σταδίους μάλιστα δέκα τῆς θαλάσσης .
While then the Athenians were yet sailing towards them, the Aeginetans evacuated the fortifications on the sea which they had happened to be building, and retreated to the upper town, in which they lived, at the distance of about ten states from the sea.


4.57.2
2892
καὶ αὐτοῖς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων φρουρὰ μία τῶν περὶ τὴν χώραν , ἥπερ καὶ ξυνετείχιζε , ξυνεσελθεῖν μὲν ἐς τὸ τεῖχος οὐκ ἠθέλησαν δεομένων τῶν Αἰγινητῶν , ἀλλ’ αὐτοῖς κίνδυνος ἐφαίνετο ἐς τὸ τεῖχος κατακλῄεσθαι ·
And one of the garrisons in the country, which was also assisting them in the works, would not go with them within the wall, though the Aeginetans requested them; but thought it dangerous to be shut up within it;


4.57.2
2893
ἀναχωρήσαντες δὲ ἐπὶ τὰ μετέωρα , ὡς οὐκ ἐνόμιζον ἀξιόμαχοι εἶναι , ἡσύχαζον .
and so having retreated to the higher ground remained quiet, as they did not consider themselves a match for the enemy.


4.57.3
2894
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι κατασχόντες καὶ χωρήσαντες εὐθὺς πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ αἱροῦσι τὴν Θυρέαν .
In the meantime, the Athenians landed, and advanced straightway with all their forces, and took Thyrea.


4.57.3
2895
καὶ τήν τε πόλιν κατέκαυσαν καὶ τὰ ἐνόντα ἐξεπόρθησαν , τούς τε Αἰγινήτας , ὅσοι μὴ ἐν χερσὶ διεφθάρησαν , ἄγοντες ἀφίκοντο ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας καὶ τὸν ἄρχοντα ὃς παρ’ αὐτοῖς ἦν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων , Τάνταλον τὸν Πατροκλέους ·
The town they burnt down, and plundered the property in it, and took the Aeginetans with them to Athens, excepting those that had fallen in battle, and the Lacedaemonian commander who was amongst them, Tantalus the son of Patrocles;


4.57.3
2896
ἐζωγρήθη γὰρ τετρωμένος .
for he was taken prisoner after being wounded.


4.57.4
2897
ἦγον δέ τινας καὶ ἐκ τῶν Κυθήρων ἄνδρας ὀλίγους , οὓς ἐδόκει ἀσφαλείας ἕνεκα μεταστῆσαι .
They also took with them some few individuals from Cythera, whom they thought best to remove for security.


4.57.4
2898
καὶ τούτους μὲν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐβουλεύσαντο καταθέσθαι ἐς τὰς νήσους , καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους Κυθηρίους οἰκοῦντας τὴν ἑαυτῶν φόρον τέσσαρα τάλαντα φέρειν , Αἰγινήτας δὲ ἀποκτεῖναι πάντας ὅσοι ἑάλωσαν διὰ τὴν προτέραν αἰεί ποτε ἔχθραν , Τάνταλον δὲ παρὰ τοὺς ἄλλους τοὺς ἐν τῇ νήσῳ Λακεδαιμονίους καταδῆσαι .
These the Athenians determined to deposit in the islands; to order the rest of the Cytherians, while they retained their own country, to pay a tribute of four talents; to put to death all the Aeginetans that had been taken, for their former perpetual hostility; and to throw Tantalus into prison with the other Lacedaemonians taken in the island.


4.58.1
2899
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους ἐν Σικελίᾳ Καμαριναίοις καὶ Γελῴοις ἐκεχειρία γίγνεται πρῶτον πρὸς ἀλλήλους ·
The same summer, the inhabitants of Camarina and Gela in Sicily first made an armistice with one another;


4.58.1
2900
εἶτα καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Σικελιῶται ξυνελθόντες ἐς Γέλαν , ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων πρέσβεις , ἐς λόγους κατέστησαν ἀλλήλοις , εἴ πως ξυναλλαγεῖεν .
and then all the rest of the Sicilians also assembled at Gela, with embassies from all the cities, and held a conference together on the subject of a reconciliation.


4.58.1
2901
καὶ ἄλλαι τε πολλαὶ γνῶμαι ἐλέγοντο ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα , διαφερομένων καὶ ἀξιούντων , ὡς ἕκαστοί τι ἐλασσοῦσθαι ἐνόμιζον , καὶ Ἑρμοκράτης ὁ Ἕρμωνος Συρακόσιος , ὅσπερ καὶ ἔπεισε μάλιστα αὐτούς , ἐς τὸ κοινὸν τοιούτους δὴ λόγους εἶπεν .
And many other opinions were expressed on both sides of the question, while they stated their differences and urged their claims, as they severally thought themselves injured; and Hermocrates son of Hermon, a Syracusan, the man who had the greatest influence with them, addressed the following words to the assembly:


4.59.1
2902
&quot; οὔτε πόλεως ὢν ἐλαχίστης , ὦ Σικελιῶται , τοὺς λόγους ποιήσομαι οὔτε πονουμένης μάλιστα τῷ πολέμῳ , ἐς κοινὸν δὲ τὴν δοκοῦσάν μοι βελτίστην γνώμην εἶναι ἀποφαινόμενος τῇ Σικελίᾳ πάσῃ .
"It is not because I am of a city that is either the least powerful, or the most distressed by hostilities, that I shall address you, Sicilians, but in order publicly to state what appears to me the best policy for the whole of Sicily.


4.59.2
2903
καὶ περὶ μὲν τοῦ πολεμεῖν ὡς χαλεπὸν τί ἄν τις πᾶν τὸ ἐνὸν ἐκλέγων ἐν εἰδόσι μακρηγοροίη ;
And now with regard to war, to prove that it is a disastrous thing, why need one particularize all the evil involved in it, and so make a long speech before those who are acquainted with it?


4.59.2
2904
οὐδεὶς γὰρ οὔτε ἀμαθίᾳ ἀναγκάζεται αὐτὸ δρᾶν , οὔτε φόβῳ , ἢν οἴηταί τι πλέον σχήσειν , ἀποτρέπεται .
For no one is either driven to engage in it through ignorance, deterred from it by fear, should he think that he will gain any advantage;


4.59.2
2905
ξυμβαίνει δὲ τοῖς μὲν τὰ κέρδη μείζω φαίνεσθαι τῶν δεινῶν , οἱ δὲ τοὺς κινδύνους ἐθέλουσιν ὑφίστασθαι πρὸ τοῦ αὐτίκα τι ἐλασσοῦσθαι ·
but it is the lot of the former to imagine the gains greater than the dangers; and the latter will face the perils rather than put up with any present loss.


4.59.3
2906
αὐτὰ δὲ ταῦτα εἰ μὴ ἐν καιρῷ τύχοιεν ἑκάτεροι πράσσοντες , αἱ παραινέσεις τῶν ξυναλλαγῶν ὠφέλιμοι .
But if both should happen to be thus acting unseasonably, exhortations to peace would be useful And this would be most serviceable to us too at the present time, if we did but believe it.


4.59.4
2907
ὃ καὶ ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ παρόντι πειθομένοις πλείστου ἂν ἄξιον γένοιτο ·
For it was surely with a purpose of well securing our own several interests that we both went to war at first,


4.59.4
2908
τὰ γὰρ ἴδια ἕκαστοι εὖ βουλευόμενοι δὴ θέσθαι τό τε πρῶτον ἐπολεμήσαμεν καὶ νῦν πρὸς ἀλλήλους δι’ ἀντιλογιῶν πειρώμεθα καταλλαγῆναι καί , ἢν ἄρα μὴ προχωρήσῃ ἴσον ἑκάστῳ ἔχοντι ἀπελθεῖν , πάλιν πολεμήσομεν .
and are endeavouring by means of conference to come to terms again with each other; and if each one should not succeed in going away with what is fair, we shall proceed to hostilities again.


4.60.1
2909
&quot; καίτοι γνῶναι χρὴ ὅτι οὐ περὶ τῶν ἰδίων μόνον , εἰ σωφρονοῦμεν , ἡ ξύνοδος ἔσται , ἀλλ’ εἰ ἐπιβουλευομένην τὴν πᾶσαν Σικελίαν , ὡς ἐγὼ κρίνω , ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων δυνησόμεθα ἔτι διασῶσαι ·
"We should be convinced, however, that it is not for our own separate interests alone, if we are wise, that this congress will be held;


4.60.1
2910
καὶ διαλλακτὰς πολὺ τῶν ἐμῶν λόγων ἀναγκαιοτέρους περὶ τῶνδε Ἀθηναίους νομίσαι , οἳ δύναμιν ἔχοντες μεγίστην τῶν Ἑλλήνων τάς τε ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν τηροῦσιν ὀλίγαις ναυσὶ παρόντες , καὶ ὀνόματι ἐννόμῳ ξυμμαχίας τὸ φύσει πολέμιον εὐπρεπῶς ἐς τὸ ξυμφέρον καθίστανται .
but to consider whether we shall be able any longer to save the whole of Sicily, which, as I conceive, is the object of the machinations of the Athenians. And we should regard that people as much more compulsory mediators in such case than my words; who, possessing as they do the greatest power of all the Greeks, are watching our blunders, being here with a few ships; and under the legitimate name of alliance are speciously bringing to a profitable conclusion their natural hostility to us.


4.60.2
2911
πόλεμον γὰρ αἰρομένων ἡμῶν καὶ ἐπαγομένων αὐτούς , ἄνδρας οἳ καὶ τοῖς μὴ ἐπικαλουμένοις αὐτοὶ ἐπιστρατεύουσι , κακῶς τε ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς ποιούντων τέλεσι τοῖς οἰκείοις , καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἅμα προκοπτόντων ἐκείνοις , εἰκός , ὅταν γνῶσιν ἡμᾶς τετρυχωμένους , καὶ πλέονί ποτε στόλῳ ἐλθόντας αὐτοὺς τάδε πάντα πειράσασθαι ὑπὸ σφᾶς ποιεῖσθαι .
For if we go to war, and call them in to our aid, men who of their own accord turn their arms even upon such as do not call them in; and if we injure ourselves by means of our own resources, and at the same time pave the way for their dominion: it is probable that when they observe us worn out, they will come hereafter with a great force, and endeavour to bring all these states into subjection to them.


4.61.1
2912
&quot; καίτοι τῇ ἑαυτῶν ἑκάστους , εἰ σωφρονοῦμεν , χρὴ τὰ μὴ προσήκοντα ἐπικτωμένους μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ ἑτοῖμα βλάπτοντας ξυμμάχους τε ἐπάγεσθαι καὶ τοὺς κινδύνους προσλαμβάνειν , νομίσαι τε στάσιν μάλιστα φθείρειν τὰς πόλεις καὶ τὴν Σικελίαν , ἧς γε οἱ ἔνοικοι ξύμπαντες μὲν ἐπιβουλευόμεθα , κατὰ πόλεις δὲ διέσταμεν .
"And yet we ought, if we are wise, to aim at acquiring for our own respective countries what does not belong to them, rather than at diminishing what they already have, both in calling in allies and incurring fresh dangers; and to consider that faction is most ruinous to states, and particularly to Sicily, the inhabitants of which are all being plotted against, while we are at variance city with city.


4.61.2
2913
ἃ χρὴ γνόντας καὶ ἰδιώτην ἰδιώτῃ καταλλαγῆναι καὶ πόλιν πόλει , καὶ πειρᾶσθαι κοινῇ σῴζειν τὴν πᾶσαν Σικελίαν , παρεστάναι δὲ μηδενὶ ὡς οἱ μὲν Δωριῆς ἡμῶν πολέμιοι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , τὸ δὲ Χαλκιδικὸν τῇ Ἰάδι ξυγγενείᾳ ἀσφαλές .
Knowing this then, we ought to make peace, individual with individual, and state with state, and to make a common effort to save the whole of Sicily: and the thought should be entertained by no one, that though the Dorian part of us are enemies of the Athenians, the Chalcidian race is secured by its Ionian connexion.


4.61.3
2914
οὐ γὰρ τοῖς ἔθνεσιν , ὅτι δίχα πέφυκε , τοῦ ἑτέρου ἔχθει ἐπίασιν , ἀλλὰ τῶν ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ ἀγαθῶν ἐφιέμενοι , ἃ κοινῇ κεκτήμεθα .
For they are not attacking our nations, because they are different, and from their hatred of one of them; but from coveting the good things of Sicily, which we possess in common.


4.61.4
2915
ἐδήλωσαν δὲ νῦν ἐν τῇ τοῦ Χαλκιδικοῦ γένους παρακλήσει ·
And this they have now shown upon the invitation of the Chalcidian race:


4.61.4
2916
τοῖς γὰρ οὐδεπώποτε σφίσι κατὰ τὸ ξυμμαχικὸν προσβοηθήσασιν αὐτοὶ τὸ δίκαιον μᾶλλον τῆς ξυνθήκης προθύμως παρέσχοντο .
for to those who had never yet assisted them on the ground of their alliance, they themselves with forwardness answered their claim, beyond the letter of the compact.


4.61.5
2917
καὶ τοὺς μὲν Ἀθηναίους ταῦτα πλεονεκτεῖν τε καὶ προνοεῖσθαι πολλὴ ξυγγνώμη , καὶ οὐ τοῖς ἄρχειν βουλομένοις μέμφομαι , ἀλλὰ τοῖς ὑπακούειν ἑτοιμοτέροις οὖσιν ·
And very excusable is it that the Athenians should practise this covetousness and forecasting; and I blame not those who wish to reign, but those who are too ready to be subject.


4.61.5
2918
πέφυκε γὰρ τὸ ἀνθρώπειον διὰ παντὸς ἄρχειν μὲν τοῦ εἴκοντος , φυλάσσεσθαι δὲ τὸ ἐπιόν .
For human nature is always disposed to rule those that submit, but to guard against those that attack.


4.61.6
2919
ὅσοι δὲ γιγνώσκοντες αὐτὰ μὴ ὀρθῶς προσκοποῦμεν , μηδὲ τοῦτό τις πρεσβύτατον ἥκει κρίνας , τὸ κοινῶς φοβερὸν ἅπαντας εὖ θέσθαι , ἁμαρτάνομεν .
And if any of us know this, but do not forecast as we ought, and if any one has come here without regarding it as his first care, that all should make a good arrangement for what is a general cause of alarm; we are mistaken in our views.


4.61.7
2920
τάχιστα δ’ ἂν ἀπαλλαγὴ αὐτοῦ γένοιτο , εἰ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ξυμβαῖμεν ·
Most speedily then should we be rid of that alarm by making peace with each other:


4.61.7
2921
οὐ γὰρ ἀπὸ τῆς αὑτῶν ὁρμῶνται Ἀθηναῖοι , ἀλλ’ ἐκ τῆς τῶν ἐπικαλεσαμένων .
for it is not from their own country that the Athenians set out against us, but from that of those who invited them here.


4.61.7
2922
καὶ οὕτως οὐ πόλεμος πολέμῳ , εἰρήνῃ δὲ διαφοραὶ ἀπραγμόνως παύονται , οἵ τ’ ἐπίκλητοι εὐπρεπῶς ἄδικοι ἐλθόντες εὐλόγως ἄπρακτοι ἀπίασιν .
And in this way war is not terminated by war, but our quarrels are ended without trouble by peace; and those who have been called in, having come with specious injustice, will go back with reasonable want of success.


4.62.1
2923
&quot; καὶ τὸ μὲν πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τοσοῦτον ἀγαθὸν εὖ βουλευομένοις εὑρίσκεται ·
"With regard to the Athenians then, so great is found to be the benefit of our taking good advice.


4.62.2
2924
τὴν δὲ ὑπὸ πάντων ὁμολογουμένην ἄριστον εἶναι εἰρήνην πῶς οὐ χρὴ καὶ ἐν ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ποιήσασθαι ;
And with regard to peace, which is acknowledged by all to be a most excellent thing, how can it fail to be incumbent on us to conclude it amongst ourselves?


4.62.2
2925
ἢ δοκεῖτε , εἴ τῴ τι ἔστιν ἀγαθὸν ἢ εἴ τῳ τὰ ἐναντία , οὐχ ἡσυχίαν μᾶλλον ἢ πόλεμον τὸ μὲν παῦσαι ἂν ἑκατέρῳ , τὸ δὲ ξυνδιασῶσαι , καὶ τὰς τιμὰς καὶ λαμπρότητας ἀκινδυνοτέρας ἔχειν τὴν εἰρήνην , ἄλλα τε ὅσα ἐν μήκει λόγων ἄν τις διέλθοι , ὥσπερ περὶ τοῦ πολεμεῖν ;
Or do you think, that whatever good thing, or the contrary, any one has, quiet would not more effectually than war put a stop to the latter, and help to preserve the former; and that peace has not the less hazardous honours and splendours?


4.62.2
2926
ἃ χρὴ σκεψαμένους μὴ τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους ὑπεριδεῖν , τὴν δὲ αὑτοῦ τινὰ σωτηρίαν μᾶλλον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν προϊδεῖν .
With all other topics which one might discuss in many words, on such a subject as war. Considering then these things, you ought not to disregard what I say, but should rather provide each for your own safety in compliance with it.


4.62.3
2927
καὶ εἴ τις βεβαίως τι ἢ τῷ δικαίῳ ἢ βίᾳ πράξειν οἴεται , τῷ παρ’ ἐλπίδα μὴ χαλεπῶς σφαλλέσθω , γνοὺς ὅτι πλείους ἤδη καὶ τιμωρίαις μετιόντες τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας καὶ ἐλπίσαντες ἕτεροι δυνάμει τινὶ πλεονεκτήσειν , οἱ μὲν οὐχ ὅσον οὐκ ἠμύναντο , ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἐσώθησαν , τοὺς δ’ ἀντὶ τοῦ πλέον ἔχειν προσκαταλιπεῖν τὰ αὑτῶν ξυνέβη .
And if any one think that he shall certainly gain some advantage, either by right or might, let him not be annoyed by failure through the unexpected result; knowing that many men ere now, both while pursuing with vengeance those who have wronged them, and hoping, in other instances, to win an advantage by greater power, in the one case, so far from avenging themselves, have not even saved themselves; and in the other, instead of gaining more, have happened also to lose what they had.


4.62.4
2928
τιμωρία γὰρ οὐκ εὐτυχεῖ δικαίως , ὅτι καὶ ἀδικεῖται ·
For vengeance is not necessarily successful, because a man is injured;


4.62.4
2929
οὐδὲ ἰσχὺς βέβαιον , διότι καὶ εὔελπι .
Nor is strength sure, because it is sanguine.


4.62.4
2930
τὸ δὲ ἀστάθμητον τοῦ μέλλοντος ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον κρατεῖ , πάντων τε σφαλερώτατον ὂν ὅμως καὶ χρησιμώτατον φαίνεται ·
But the incalculable nature of the future prevails to the greatest possible degree;


4.62.4
2931
ἐξ ἴσου γὰρ δεδιότες προμηθίᾳ μᾶλλον ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους ἐρχόμεθα .
And though the most deceptive of all things, still proves the most useful: for because we are equally afraid, we are more cautious in attacking one another.

&quot; καὶ νῦν τοῦ ἀφανοῦς τε τούτου διὰ τὸ ἀτέκμαρτον δέος καὶ διὰ τὸ ἤδη † φοβεροὺς παρόντας Ἀθηναίους , κατ’ ἀμφότερα ἐκπλαγέντες , καὶ τὸ ἐλλιπὲς τῆς γνώμης , ὧν ἕκαστός τι ᾠήθημεν πράξειν , ταῖς κωλύμαις ταύταις ἱκανῶς νομίσαντες εἰρχθῆναι , τοὺς ἐφεστῶτας πολεμίους ἐκ τῆς χώρας ἀποπέμπωμεν , καὶ αὐτοὶ μάλιστα μὲν ἐς ἀίδιον ξυμβῶμεν , εἰ δὲ μή , χρόνον ὡς πλεῖστον σπεισάμενοι τὰς ἰδίας διαφορὰς ἐς αὖθις ἀναβαλώμεθα .
"And now, on account of our indefinite fear of this unknown future, and our immediate dread of the Athenians' presence, being alarmed on both these grounds, and thinking, with regard to any failure in our ideas of what we severally thought to achieve, that these obstacles are a sufficient bar to their fulfilment, let us send away from the country the enemy that is amongst us, and ourselves make peace for ever, if possible; but if not that, let us make a treaty for the longest term we can, and put off our private differences to a future period.


4.63.2
2933
τὸ ξύμπαν τε δὴ γνῶμεν πειθόμενοι μὲν ἐμοὶ πόλιν ἕξοντες ἕκαστος ἐλευθέραν , ἀφ’ ἧς αὐτοκράτορες ὄντες τὸν εὖ καὶ κακῶς δρῶντα ἐξ ἴσου ἀρετῇ ἀμυνούμεθα ·
In a word, let us be convinced that by following my advice we shall each have a free city, from which we shall, as our own masters, make an equally good return to him who treats us either well or ill:


4.63.2
2934
ἢν δ’ ἀπιστήσαντες ἄλλοις ὑπακούσωμεν , οὐ περὶ τοῦ τιμωρήσασθαί τινα , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄγαν εἰ τύχοιμεν , φίλοι μὲν ἂν τοῖς ἐχθίστοις , διάφοροι δὲ οἷς οὐ χρὴ κατ’ ἀνάγκην γιγνοίμεθα .
But if, through not following it, we are subject to others, then, not to speak of avenging ourselves on any one, we necessarily become, even if most fortunate, friends to our greatest enemies, and at variance with those with whom we ought not to be so.


4.64.1
2935
&quot; καὶ ἐγὼ μέν , ἅπερ καὶ ἀρχόμενος εἶπον , πόλιν τε μεγίστην παρεχόμενος καὶ ἐπιών τῳ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀμυνούμενος ἀξιῶ προιδόμενος αὐτῶν ξυγχωρεῖν , καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἐναντίους οὕτω κακῶς δρᾶν ὥστε αὐτὸς τὰ πλείω βλάπτεσθαι , μηδὲ μωρίᾳ φιλονικῶν ἡγεῖσθαι τῆς τε οἰκείας γνώμης ὁμοίως αὐτοκράτωρ εἶναι καὶ ἧς οὐκ ἄρχω τύχης , ἀλλ’ ὅσον εἰκὸς ἡσσᾶσθαι .
" And for myself, although, as I said at the beginning of my speech, I represent a most powerful city, and am more likely to attack another than to defend myself, yet I think it right to provide against these these things, and to make concessions; and not so to injure my enemies as to incur greater damage myself; nor through a foolish animosity to think that I have absolute sway alike over my own plans and over fortune, which I cannot control;"


4.64.2
2936
καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους δικαιῶ τ- αὐτό μοι ποιῆσαι , ὑφ’ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν καὶ μὴ ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων τοῦτο παθεῖν .
" but to give way, as far as is reasonable. And I call on you all, of your own free will, to act in the same manner as myself, and not to be compelled to do it by your enemies."


4.64.3
2937
οὐδὲν γὰρ αἰσχρὸν οἰκείους οἰκείων ἡσσᾶσθαι , ἢ Δωριᾶ τινὰ Δωριῶς ἢ Χαλκιδέα τῶν ξυγγενῶν , τὸ δὲ ξύμπαν γείτονας ὄντας καὶ ξυνοίκους μιᾶς χώρας καὶ περιρρύτου καὶ ὄνομα ἓν κεκλημένους Σικελιώτας ·
For there is no disgrace in connexions giving way to connexions, whether a Dorian to a Dorian, or a Chalcidian to those of the same race;


4.64.3
2938
οἳ πολεμήσομέν τε , οἶμαι , ὅταν ξυμβῇ , καὶ ξυγχωρησόμεθά γε πάλιν καθ’ ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς λόγοις κοινοῖς χρώμενοι ·
In a word, all of us who are neighbours, and live together in one country, and that an island, and are called by the one name of Sicilians.


4.64.4
2939
τοὺς δὲ ἀλλοφύλους ἐπελθόντας ἁθρόοι αἰεί , ἢν σωφρονῶμεν , ἀμυνούμεθα , εἴπερ καὶ καθ’ ἑκάστους βλαπτόμενοι ξύμπαντες κινδυνεύομεν ·
For we shall go to war again, I suppose, when it may so happen, and come to terms again amongst ourselves by means of general conferences:


4.64.4
2940
ξυμμάχους δὲ οὐδέποτε τὸ λοιπὸν ἐπαξόμεθα οὐδὲ διαλλακτάς .
But to foreign invaders we shall always, if we are wise, offer united resistance, inasmuch as by our separate losses we are collectively endangered.


4.64.5
2941
τάδε γὰρ ποιοῦντες ἔν τε τῷ παρόντι δυοῖν ἀγαθοῖν οὐ στερήσομεν τὴν Σικελίαν , Ἀθηναίων τε ἀπαλλαγῆναι καὶ οἰκείου πολέμου , καὶ ἐς τὸ ἔπειτα καθ’ ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς ἐλευθέραν νεμούμεθα καὶ ὑπὸ ἄλλων ἧσσον ἐπιβουλευομένην &quot; .
" and we shall never in future call in any allies or mediators. For by acting thus we shall at the present time avoid depriving Sicily of two blessings—riddance both of the Athenians and of civil war—and shall in future enjoy it by ourselves in freedom, and less exposed to the machinations of others."


4.65.1
2942
τοιαῦτα τοῦ Ἑρμοκράτους εἰπόντος πειθόμενοι οἱ Σικελιῶται αὐτοὶ μὲν κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ξυνηνέχθησαν γνώμῃ ὥστε ἀπαλλάσσεσθαι τοῦ πολέμου ἔχοντες ἃ ἕκαστοι ἔχουσι , τοῖς δὲ Καμαριναίοις Μοργαντίνην εἶναι ἀργύριον τακτὸν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις ἀποδοῦσιν ·
Hermocrates having spoken to this effect, the Sicilians agreed amongst themselves in a determination to have done with the war, retaining their several possessions, but that Morgantina should be ceded to the Camarinaeans on their paying a stipulated sum of money to the Syracusans.


4.65.2
2943
οἱ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ξύμμαχοι παρακαλέσαντες αὐτῶν τοὺς ἐν τέλει ὄντας εἶπον ὅτι ξυμβήσονται καὶ αἱ σπονδαὶ ἔσονται κ- ἐκείνοις κοιναί .
So the allies of the Athenians called those of them who were in command, and said that they should conclude peace, and that the treaty would extend to them also.


4.65.2
2944
ἐπαινεσάντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐποιοῦντο τὴν ὁμολογίαν , καὶ αἱ νῆες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπέπλευσαν μετὰ ταῦτα ἐκ Σικελίας .
When the generals had expressed their assent, they concluded peace, and the Athenian ships afterwards sailed away from Sicily.


4.65.3
2945
ἐλθόντας δὲ τοὺς στρατηγοὺς οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς μὲν φυγῇ ἐζημίωσαν , Πυθόδωρον καὶ Σοφοκλέα , τὸν δὲ τρίτον Εὐρυμέδοντα χρήματα ἐπράξαντο , ὡς ἐξὸν αὐτοῖς τὰ ἐν Σικελίᾳ καταστρέψασθαι δώροις πεισθέντες ἀποχωρήσειαν .
But on the arrival of the generals, the Athenians at home banished Pythodorus and Sophocles, and fined Eurymedon, on the belief of their having been bribed to return, when they might have brought Sicily under their dominion.


4.65.4
2946
οὕτω τῇ τε παρούσῃ εὐτυχίᾳ χρώμενοι ἠξίουν σφίσι μηδὲν ἐναντιοῦσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ δυνατὰ ἐν ἴσῳ καὶ τὰ ἀπορώτερα μεγάλῃ τε ὁμοίως καὶ ἐνδεεστέρᾳ παρασκευῇ κατεργάζεσθαι .
Thus in their present success they presumed that they could meet with no impediment, but equally achieve what was possible and impossible, with ample or deficient resources alike.


4.65.4
2947
αἰτία δ’ ἦν ἡ παρὰ λόγον τῶν πλεόνων εὐπραγία αὐτοῖς ὑποτιθεῖσα ἰσχὺν τῆς ἐλπίδος .
The reason of which was their general success beyond their calculations, which suggested to them an idea of strength resting only on hope.


4.66.1
2948
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους Μεγαρῆς οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει πιεζόμενοι ὑπό τε Ἀθηναίων τῷ πολέμῳ , αἰεὶ κατὰ ἔτος ἕκαστον δὶς ἐσβαλλόντων πανστρατιᾷ ἐς τὴν χώραν , καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν σφετέρων φυγάδων τῶν ἐκ Πηγῶν , οἳ στασιασάντων ἐκπεσόντες ὑπὸ τοῦ πλήθους χαλεποὶ ἦσαν λῃστεύοντες , ἐποιοῦντο λόγους ἐν ἀλλήλοις ὡς χρὴ δεξαμένους τοὺς φεύγοντας μὴ ἀμφοτέρωθεν τὴν πόλιν φθείρειν .
The same summer, the Megareans in the city, pressed at once by the hostilities of the Athenians, who always invaded their country in full force twice a year, and by their own exiles in Pegae, who had been expelled during the strife of factions by the popular party, and harassed them by their forays, began to discuss amongst themselves the propriety of receiving back their exiles, and not ruining the city in both ways.


4.66.2
2949
οἱ δὲ φίλοι τῶν ἔξω τὸν θροῦν αἰσθόμενοι φανερῶς μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον καὶ αὐτοὶ ἠξίουν τούτου τοῦ λόγου ἔχεσθαι .
The friends of the banished, when aware of such discussion, themselves begged them more openly than before to adopt this proposal.


4.66.3
2950
γνόντες δὲ οἱ τοῦ δήμου προστάται οὐ δυνατὸν τὸν δῆμον ἐσόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν κακῶν μετὰ σφῶν καρτερεῖν , ποιοῦνται λόγους δείσαντες πρὸς τοὺς τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγούς , Ἱπποκράτη τε τὸν Ἀρίφρονος καὶ Δημοσθένη τὸν Ἀλκισθένους , βουλόμενοι ἐνδοῦναι τὴν πόλιν καὶ νομίζοντες ἐλάσσω σφίσι τὸν κίνδυνον ἢ τοὺς ἐκπεσόντας ὑπὸ σφῶν κατελθεῖν .
But the leaders of the commons, knowing that the populace would not be able under the pressure of their sufferings to hold out with them, in their fear entered into communication with the Athenian generals, Hippocrates son of Ariphron, and Demosthenes son of Alcisthenes, wishing to betray the city to them, and thinking that the danger to themselves would be less than from the return of those who had been banished by them.


4.66.3
2951
ξυνέβησάν τε πρῶτα μὲν τὰ μακρὰ τείχη ἑλεῖν Ἀθηναίους ( ἦν δὲ σταδίων μάλιστα ὀκτὼ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ τὴν Νίσαιαν τὸν λιμένα αὐτῶν ) , ὅπως μὴ ἐπιβοηθήσωσιν ἐκ τῆς Νισαίας οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι , ἐν ᾗ αὐτοὶ μόνοι ἐφρούρουν βεβαιότητος ἕνεκα τῶν Μεγάρων , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τὴν ἄνω πόλιν πειρᾶσθαι ἐνδοῦναι ·
It was agreed then that in the first place the Athenians should take the long walls, (they were about eight stades in length, from the city to Nisaea their port,) that the Peloponnesians might not come to the rescue from Nisaea, where they alone formed the garrison to secure the good faith of Megara; and then that they should endeavour to put the upper town into their hands:


4.66.3
2952
ῥᾷον δ’ ἤδη ἔμελλον προσχωρήσειν τούτου γεγενημένου .
and they thought the inhabitants would the more readily surrender when that had been done.


4.67.1
2953
οἱ οὖν Ἀθηναῖοι , ἐπειδὴ ἀπό τε τῶν ἔργων καὶ τῶν λόγων παρεσκεύαστο ἀμφοτέροις , ὑπὸ νύκτα πλεύσαντες ἐς Μινῴαν τὴν Μεγαρέων νῆσον ὁπλίταις ἑξακοσίοις , ὧν Ἱπποκράτης ἦρχεν , ἐν ὀρύγματι ἐκαθέζοντο , ὅθεν ἐπλίνθευον τὰ τείχη καὶ ἀπεῖχεν οὐ πολύ ·
The Athenians therefore, when preparations had been made on each side, both by deeds and words, sailed in the night to Minoa, an island off Megara, with six hundred heavyarmed under the command of Hippocrates, and posted themselves in an excavated piece of ground, from which they used to make their bricks, and which was not far off;


4.67.2
2954
οἱ δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Δημοσθένους τοῦ ἑτέρου στρατηγοῦ Πλαταιῆς τε ψιλοὶ καὶ ἕτεροι περίπολοι ἐνήδρευσαν ἐς τὸ Ἐνυάλιον , ὅ ἐστιν ἔλασσον ἄπωθεν .
while the troops, with Demosthenes, the other commander, consisting of light-armed Plataeans, and a second corps composed of placed themselves in ambuscade in the ground consecrated to Mars, which was at a less distance.


4.67.2
2955
καὶ ᾔσθετο οὐδεὶς εἰ μὴ οἱ ἄνδρες οἷς ἐπιμελὲς ἦν εἰδέναι τὴν νύκτα ταύτην .
Now no one was aware of this but those who took care to know [what was doing] that night.


4.67.3
2956
καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἕως ἔμελλε γίγνεσθαι , οἱ προδιδόντες τῶν Μεγαρέων οὗτοι τοιόνδε ἐποίησαν .
When day was about to dawn, the traitors amongst the Megareans did as follows.


4.67.3
2957
ἀκάτιον ἀμφηρικὸν ὡς λῃσταί , ἐκ πολλοῦ τεθεραπευκότες τὴν ἄνοιξιν τῶν πυλῶν , εἰώθεσαν ἐπὶ ἁμάξῃ , πείθοντες τὸν ἄρχοντα , διὰ τῆς τάφρου κατακομίζειν τῆς νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἐκπλεῖν ·
They had for a long time past used means to secure the opening of the gates, and with the consent of the officer in command, in the guise of privateers, to carry on a cart, during the night, a boat worked by sculls along the trench down to the sea, and so sail out;


4.67.3
2958
καὶ πρὶν ἡμέραν εἶναι πάλιν αὐτὸ τῇ ἁμάξῃ κομίσαντες ἐς τὸ τεῖχος κατὰ τὰς πύλας ἐσῆγον , ὅπως τοῖς ἐκ τῆς Μινῴας Ἀθηναίοις ἀφανὴς δὴ εἴη ἡ φυλακή , μὴ ὄντος ἐν τῷ λιμένι πλοίου φανεροῦ μηδενός .
and before it was day, they brought it again on the cart, and took it within the wall through the gates; that the Athenians, as they pretended, might not know what precautions to take, no boat being visible in the harbour.


4.67.4
2959
καὶ τότε πρὸς ταῖς πύλαις ἤδη ἦν ἡ ἅμαξα , καὶ ἀνοιχθεισῶν κατὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς ὡς τῷ ἀκατίῳ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἐγίγνετο γὰρ ἀπὸ ξυνθήματος τὸ τοιοῦτον ) ἰδόντες ἔθεον δρόμῳ ἐκ τῆς ἐνέδρας , βουλόμενοι φθάσαι πρὶν ξυγκλῃσθῆναι πάλιν τὰς πύλας καὶ ἕως ἔτι ἡ ἅμαξα ἐν αὐταῖς ἦν , κώλυμα οὖσα προσθεῖναι ·
And on that occasion the cart was already at the gates, and on their being opened in the usual manner for the skiff, as they thought, the Athenians, (for this had been done by agreement with them,) on seeing it, ran full speed from their ambush, wishing to reach the spot before the gates were shut again, and while the cart was still in the entrance, and prevented their being closed;


4.67.4
2960
καὶ αὐτοῖς ἅμα καὶ οἱ ξυμπράσσοντες Μεγαρῆς τοὺς κατὰ τὰς πύλας φύλακας κτείνουσιν .
the Megareans who were in concert with them at the same time dispatching the guard at the gate.


4.67.5
2961
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν οἱ περὶ τὸν Δημοσθένη Πλαταιῆς τε καὶ περίπολοι ἐσέδραμον οὗ νῦν τὸ τροπαῖόν ἐστι , καὶ εὐθὺς ἐντὸς τῶν πυλῶν ( ᾔσθοντο γὰρ οἱ ἐγγύτατα Πελοποννήσιοι ) μαχόμενοι τοὺς προσβοηθοῦντας οἱ Πλαταιῆς ἐκράτησαν καὶ τοῖς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὁπλίταις ἐπιφερομένοις βεβαίους τὰς πύλας παρέσχον ·
Demosthenes with his Plataeans and  were the first to run in, (at the point where the trophy now stands,) and as soon as they were within the wall, (for now the nearest Peloponnesians were aware of it,) the Plataeans engaged with and defeated those who came to the rescue, and secured the gates for the advancing heavy-armed of the Athenians.


4.68.1
2962
ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἤδη ὁ αἰεὶ ἐντὸς γιγνόμενος ἐχώρει ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος .
Then each of the Athenians, as he successively entered, proceeded against the wall.


4.68.2
2963
καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι φρουροὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἀντίσχοντες ἠμύνοντο ὀλίγοι , καὶ ἀπέθανόν τινες αὐτῶν , οἱ δὲ πλείους ἐς φυγὴν κατέστησαν , φοβηθέντες ἐν νυκτί τε πολεμίων προσπεπτωκότων καὶ τῶν προδιδόντων Μεγαρέων ἀντιμαχομένων , νομίσαντες τοὺς ἅπαντας σφᾶς Μεγαρέας προδεδωκέναι .
And of the Peloponnesian garrison a few at first resisted, and defended themselves, and some of them were killed; but the greater part took to flight, being terrified in consequence of the enemy having attacked them by night, and the Megarean traitors fighting against them; and thinking that all the Megareans had betrayed them.


4.68.3
2964
ξυνέπεσε γὰρ καὶ τὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων κήρυκα ἀφ’ ἑαυτοῦ γνώμης κηρύξαι τὸν βουλόμενον ἰέναι Μεγαρέων μετὰ Ἀθηναίων θησόμενον τὰ ὅπλα .
For it happened that the Athenian herald had of his own accord proclaimed, that whoever of the Megareans wished, should go and pile his arms with the Athenians.


4.68.3
2965
οἱ δ’ ὡς ἤκουσαν , οὐκέτι ἀνέμενον , ἀλλὰ τῷ ὄντι νομίσαντες κοινῇ πολεμεῖσθαι κατέφυγον ἐς τὴν Νίσαιαν .
So when they heard that, they stayed no longer; but thinking that they were certainly the objects of a common attack, fled for refuge to Nisaea.


4.68.4
2966
ἅμα δὲ ἕῳ ἑαλωκότων ἤδη τῶν τειχῶν καὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει Μεγαρέων θορυβουμένων οἱ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους πράξαντες καὶ ἄλλο μετ’ αὐτῶν πλῆθος , ὃ ξυνῄδει , ἔφασαν χρῆναι ἀνοίγειν τὰς πύλας καὶ ἐπεξιέναι ἐς μάχην .
In the morning, when the walls were now taken, and the Megareans in the city were in confusion, those who had negotiated with the Athenians, and others with them, viz. the popular party who were privy to the measure, said that they ought to throw open the gates, and march out to battle. It had been arranged by them, that when the gates were opened, the Athenians should rush in;


4.68.5
2967
ξυνέκειτο δὲ αὐτοῖς τῶν πυλῶν ἀνοιχθεισῶν ἐσπίπτειν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , αὐτοὶ δὲ διάδηλοι ἔμελλον ἔσεσθαι ( λίπα γὰρ ἀλείψεσθαι ) , ὅπως μὴ ἀδικῶνται .
and they themselves would be distinguished from the rest, for they said they would anoint themselves with oil, that they might not be hurt.


4.68.5
2968
ἀσφάλεια δὲ αὐτοῖς μᾶλλον ἐγίγνετο τῆς ἀνοίξεως ·
And they felt the greater security in opening the gates,


4.68.5
2969
καὶ γὰρ οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἐλευσῖνος κατὰ τὸ ξυγκείμενον τετρακισχίλιοι ὁπλῖται τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ ἱππῆς ἑξακόσιοι οἱ τὴν νύκτα πορευόμενοι παρῆσαν .
since, according to agreement, the four thousand Athenian heavy-armed from Eleusis, and six hundred horse, had marched all night, and were now there.


4.68.6
2970
ἀληλιμμένων δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ ὄντων ἤδη περὶ τὰς πύλας καταγορεύει τις ξυνειδὼς τοῖς ἑτέροις τὸ ἐπιβούλευμα .
But when they were anointed, and were now standing about the gates, one of their associates gave information of the plot to the other party,


4.68.6
2971
καὶ οἳ ξυστραφέντες ἁθρόοι ἦλθον καὶ οὐκ ἔφασαν χρῆναι οὔτε ἐπεξιέναι ( οὐδὲ γὰρ πρότερόν πω τοῦτο ἰσχύοντες μᾶλλον τολμῆσαι ) οὔτε ἐς κίνδυνον φανερὸν τὴν πόλιν καταγαγεῖν ·
who consequently united, and came in a body, and urged that they ought neither to march out, (for not even before, when they were stronger, had they ever ventured on this,) nor to bring the city into evident danger;


4.68.6
2972
εἴ τε μὴ πείσεταί τις , αὐτοῦ τὴν μάχην ἔσεσθαι .
and if any one did not obey them, there, [in Megara itself,] should the battle be fought.


4.68.6
2973
ἐδήλουν δὲ οὐδὲν ὅτι ἴσασι τὰ πρασσόμενα , ἀλλὰ ὡς τὰ βέλτιστα βουλεύοντες ἰσχυρίζοντο , καὶ ἅμα περὶ τὰς πύλας παρέμενον φυλάσσοντες , ὥστε οὐκ ἐγένετο τοῖς ἐπιβουλεύουσι πρᾶξαι ὃ ἔμελλον .
But they gave no intimation of their being acquainted with their practices, but positively maintained that they were giving the best advice; and at the same time they kept their post about the gates, so that it was not possible for the conspirators to accomplish what they intended.


4.69.1
2974
γνόντες δὲ οἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοὶ ὅτι ἐναντίωμά τι ἐγένετο καὶ τὴν πόλιν βίᾳ οὐχ οἷοί τε ἔσονται λαβεῖν , τὴν Νίσαιαν εὐθὺς περιετείχιζον , νομίζοντες , εἰ πρὶν ἐπιβοηθῆσαί τινας ἐξέλοιεν , θᾶσσον ἂν καὶ τὰ Μέγαρα προσχωρῆσαι ( παρεγένετο δὲ σίδηρός τε ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ταχὺ καὶ λιθουργοὶ καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐπιτήδεια ) ·
The Athenian generals, finding that some obstacle had arisen, and that they would not be able to take the city by force, immediately proceeded to invest Nisaea; thinking that if they could take it before it was relieved, Megara also would the more quickly surrender.


4.69.2
2975
ἀρξάμενοι δ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ὃ εἶχον καὶ διοικοδομήσαντες τὸ πρὸς Μεγαρέας , ἀπ’ ἐκείνου ἑκατέρωθεν ἐς θάλασσαν τῆς Νισαίας τάφρον τε καὶ τείχη διελομένη ἡ στρατιά , ἔκ τε τοῦ προαστείου λίθοις καὶ πλίνθοις χρώμενοι , καὶ κόπτοντες τὰ δένδρα καὶ ὕλην ἀπεσταύρουν εἴ πῃ δέοιτό τι ·
Now iron, stone-masons. and all other requisites were quickly brought from Athens. So they began from the wall which they occupied, and built a cross-wall on the side of Megara, from the point mentioned down to the sea on each side of Nisaea; the whole army having divided amongst themselves the trench and walls;


4.69.2
2976
καὶ αἱ οἰκίαι τοῦ προαστείου ἐπάλξεις λαμβάνουσαι αὐταὶ ὑπῆρχον ἔρυμα .
and they used the stones and bricks from the suburb, and cutting down the fruit trees and timber, strengthened with a palisade whatever point might require it. The houses, too, in the suburb, when provided with battlements, were in themselves a fortification.


4.69.3
2977
καὶ ταύτην μὲν τὴν ἡμέραν ὅλην εἰργάζοντο ·
That whole day they continued working;


4.69.3
2978
τῇ δὲ ὑστεραίᾳ περὶ δείλην τὸ τεῖχος ὅσον οὐκ ἀπετετέλεστο , καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Νισαίᾳ δείσαντες , σίτου τε ἀπορίᾳ ( ἐφ’ ἡμέραν γὰρ ἐκ τῆς ἄνω πόλεως ἐχρῶντο ) καὶ τοὺς Πελοποννησίους οὐ νομίζοντες ταχὺ ἐπιβοηθήσειν , τούς τε Μεγαρέας πολεμίους ἡγούμενοι , ξυνέβησαν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ῥητοῦ μὲν ἕκαστον ἀργυρίου ἀπολυθῆναι ὅπλα παραδόντας , τοῖς δὲ Λακεδαιμονίοις , τῷ τε ἄρχοντι καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος ἐνῆν , χρῆσθαι Ἀθηναίους ὅτι ἂν βούλωνται .
and about afternoon of the next day the wall was all but completed, when the garrison in Nisaea, in despair of provisions, (for they used to receive daily rations from the upper city,) not thinking that the Peloponnesians would soon relieve them, and supposing the Megareans to be their enemies, capitulated to the Athenians, on condition that after surrendering their arms they should each be ransomed for a stipulated sum; but that the Lacedaemonians, both the commander and all others in the place, should be treated by the Athenians according to their pleasure.


4.69.4
2979
ἐπὶ τούτοις ὁμολογήσαντες ἐξῆλθον , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ μακρὰ τείχη ἀπορρήξαντες ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν Μεγαρέων πόλεως καὶ τὴν Νίσαιαν παραλαβόντες τ- ἄλλα παρεσκευάζοντο .
and the Athenians, having broken down the long walls at their abutment on Megara, and having taken possession of Nisaea, proceeded with their other preparations.


4.70.1
2980
Βρασίδας δὲ ὁ Τέλλιδος Λακεδαιμόνιος κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον ἐτύγχανε περὶ Σικυῶνα καὶ Κόρινθον ὤν , ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης στρατείαν παρασκευαζόμενος .
Now Brasidas son of Tellis, the Lacedaemonian, happened at this time to be in the neighbourhood of Sicyon and Corinth, preparing an army for Thrace.


4.70.1
2981
καὶ ὡς ᾔσθετο τῶν τειχῶν τὴν ἅλωσιν , δείσας περί τε τοῖς ἐν τῇ Νισαίᾳ Πελοποννησίοις καὶ μὴ τὰ Μέγαρα ληφθῇ , πέμπει ἔς τε τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς κελεύων κατὰ τάχος στρατιᾷ ἀπαντῆσαι ἐπὶ Τριποδίσκον ( ἔστι δὲ κώμη τῆς Μεγαρίδος ὄνομα τοῦτο ἔχουσα ὑπὸ τῷ ὄρει τῇ Γερανείᾳ ) , καὶ αὐτὸς ἔχων ἦλθεν ἑπτακοσίους μὲν καὶ δισχιλίους Κορινθίων ὁπλίτας , Φλειασίων δὲ τετρακοσίους , Σικυωνίων δὲ ἑξακοσίους , καὶ τοὺς μεθ’ αὑτοῦ ὅσοι ἤδη ξυνειλεγμένοι ἦσαν , οἰόμενος τὴν Νίσαιαν ἔτι καταλήψεσθαι ἀνάλωτον .
And when he heard of the capture of the walls, fearing both for the Peloponnesians in Nisaea, and lest Megara should be taken, he sent to the Boeotians with orders to meet him with a body of troops as quickly as possible at Tripodiscus, (it is a village in the Megarean territory that has this name, under Mount Gerania,) and went himself with two thousand seven hundred Corinthian heavy-armed, four hundred Phliasian, six hundred Sicyonian, and all his own forces that had been already raised, thinking that he should still find Nisaea untaken.


4.70.2
2982
ὡς δὲ ἐπύθετο ( ἔτυχε γὰρ νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τὸν Τριποδίσκον ἐξελθών ) , ἀπολέξας τριακοσίους τοῦ στρατοῦ , πρὶν ἔκπυστος γενέσθαι , προσῆλθε τῇ τῶν Μεγαρέων πόλει λαθὼν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ὄντας περὶ τὴν θάλασσαν , βουλόμενος μὲν τῷ λόγῳ καὶ ἅμα , εἰ δύναιτο , ἔργῳ τῆς Νισαίας πειρᾶσαι , τὸ δὲ μέγιστον , τὴν τῶν Μεγαρέων πόλιν ἐσελθὼν βεβαιώσασθαι .
But when he heard of its capture, (for he happened to have gone out to Tripodiscus by night,) picking out three hundred men from his army, before he was heard of, he advanced to Megara unobserved by the Athenians, who were about the shore;


4.70.2
2983
καὶ ἠξίου δέξασθαι σφᾶς , λέγων ἐν ἐλπίδι εἶναι ἀναλαβεῖν Νίσαιαν .
wishing nominally, and really too, if he could, to make an attempt on Nisaea; but, above all, to effect an entrance into Megara, and secure it. Accordingly he begged them to receive his forces, telling them that he was in hope of recovering Nisaea.


4.71.1
2984
αἱ δὲ τῶν Μεγαρέων στάσεις φοβούμεναι , οἱ μὲν μὴ τοὺς φεύγοντας σφίσιν ἐσαγαγὼν αὐτοὺς ἐκβάλῃ , οἱ δὲ μὴ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ὁ δῆμος δείσας ἐπίθηται σφίσι καὶ ἡ πόλις ἐν μάχῃ καθ’ αὑτὴν οὖσα ἐγγὺς ἐφεδρευόντων Ἀθηναίων ἀπόληται , οὐκ ἐδέξαντο , ἀλλ’ ἀμφοτέροις ἐδόκει ἡσυχάσασι τὸ μέλλον περιιδεῖν .
But the Megarean factions were afraid, on the one side, that he might introduce the exiles, and expel them; on the other, that the popular party, through fear of this very thing, might attack them, and so the city be ruined by their fighting with each other, while the Athenians were close at hand in ambush against them; and therefore they did not receive him, but both parties determined to remain quiet, and wait to see the result.


4.71.2
2985
ἤλπιζον γὰρ καὶ μάχην ἑκάτεροι ἔσεσθαι τῶν τε Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν προσβοηθησάντων , καὶ οὕτω σφίσιν ἀσφαλεστέρως ἔχειν , οἷς τις εἴη εὔνους , κρατήσασι προσχωρῆσαι ·
For each side expected that a battle would be fought between the Athenians and those who had come to relieve the place, and that so it would be safer for themselves to go over to the side they favoured, if it were victorious.


4.71.2
2986
ὁ δὲ Βρασίδας ὡς οὐκ ἔπειθεν , ἀνεχώρησε πάλιν ἐς τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα .
When therefore Brasidas did not prevail on them, he returned again to the rest of the army.


4.72.1
2987
ἅμα δὲ τῇ ἕῳ οἱ Βοιωτοὶ παρῆσαν , διανενοημένοι μὲν καὶ πρὶν Βρασίδαν πέμψαι βοηθεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ Μέγαρα , ὡς οὐκ ἀλλοτρίου ὄντος τοῦ κινδύνου , καὶ ἤδη ὄντες πανστρατιᾷ Πλαταιᾶσιν ·
In the morning the Boeotians joined them, having indeed purposed, even before Brasidas sent to them, to march to the relief of Megara, considering the danger to affect themselves, and being already in full force at Plataea;


4.72.1
2988
ἐπειδὴ δὲ καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ ἄγγελος , πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐρρώσθησαν , καὶ ἀποστείλαντες διακοσίους καὶ δισχιλίους ὁπλίτας καὶ ἱππέας ἑξακοσίους τοῖς πλέοσιν ἀπῆλθον πάλιν .
But when the messenger reached them, they felt much more confidence, and after despatching two thousand two hundred heavy-armed, and six hundred cavalry, they returned again with the main force.


4.72.2
2989
παρόντος δὲ ἤδη ξύμπαντος τοῦ στρατεύματος , ὁπλιτῶν οὐκ ἔλασσον ἑξακισχιλίων , καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων τῶν μὲν ὁπλιτῶν περί τε τὴν Νίσαιαν ὄντων καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ἐν τάξει , τῶν δὲ ψιλῶν ἀνὰ τὸ πεδίον ἐσκεδασμένων , οἱ ἱππῆς οἱ τῶν Βοιωτῶν ἀπροσδοκήτοις ἐπιπεσόντες τοῖς ψιλοῖς ἔτρεψαν ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ( ἐν γὰρ τῷ πρὸ τοῦ οὐδεμία βοήθειά πω τοῖς Μεγαρεῦσιν οὐδαμόθεν ἐπῆλθεν ) ·
When the whole army was now come, amounting to no less than six thousand heavy-armed, and when the Athenian heavy-armed were formed in line about Nisaea at the shore, but their light-armed were dispersed over the plain; the Boeotian horse fell upon the light-armed, and drove them to the sea, while they were not expecting it; for before this no succours had yet come to the Megareans from any quarter.


4.72.3
2990
ἀντεπεξελάσαντες δὲ καὶ οἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐς χεῖρας ᾖσαν , καὶ ἐγένετο ἱππομαχία ἐπὶ πολύ , ἐν ᾗ ἀξιοῦσιν ἑκάτεροι οὐχ ἥσσους γενέσθαι .
But the Athenian horse charged in return, and came to close quarters with them; and there was a cavalry action which lasted for a long time, in which both parties claim to have had the better.


4.72.4
2991
τὸν μὲν γὰρ ἵππαρχον τῶν Βοιωτῶν καὶ ἄλλους τινὰς οὐ πολλοὺς πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν Νίσαιαν προσελάσαντας οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ ἀποκτείναντες ἐσκύλευσαν , καὶ τῶν τε νεκρῶν τούτων κρατήσαντες ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν καὶ τροπαῖον ἔστησαν ·
For the Athenians, close under the walls of Nisaea, charged, killed, and stripped the Boeotian commander of the horse, and some few others;


4.72.4
2992
οὐ μέντοι ἔν γε τῷ παντὶ ἔργῳ βεβαίως οὐδέτεροι τελευτήσαντες ἀπεκρίθησαν , ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν Βοιωτοὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἑαυτῶν , οἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν Νίσαιαν .
And having got possession of these bodies, restored them under truce, and elected a trophy: yet, regarding the action as a whole, neither party retired with a decided result, but the Boeotians drew off to their forces, and the Athenians to Nisaea.


4.73.1
2993
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο Βρασίδας καὶ τὸ στράτευμα ἐχώρουν ἐγγυτέρω τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ τῆς τῶν Μεγαρέων πόλεως , καὶ καταλαβόντες χωρίον ἐπιτήδειον παραταξάμενοι ἡσύχαζον , οἰόμενοι σφίσιν ἐπιέναι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ τοὺς Μεγαρέας ἐπιστάμενοι περιορωμένους ὁποτέρων ἡ νίκη ἔσται .
After this, Brasidas and the army moved nearer to the sea and to Megara; and having chosen a convenient spot, drew up in order of battle, and remained still, thinking that the Athenians would advance against them, and knowing that the Megareans were waiting to see on which side would be the victory.


4.73.2
2994
καλῶς δὲ ἐνόμιζον σφίσιν ἀμφότερα ἔχειν , ἅμα μὲν τὸ μὴ ἐπιχειρεῖν προτέρους μηδὲ μάχης καὶ κινδύνου ἑκόντας ἄρξαι , ἐπειδή γε ἐν φανερῷ ἔδειξαν ἑτοῖμοι ὄντες ἀμύνεσθαι , καὶ αὐτοῖς ὥσπερ ἀκονιτὶ τὴν νίκην δικαίως ἂν τίθεσθαι , ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ δὲ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Μεγαρέας ὀρθῶς ξυμβαίνειν ·
And they considered that both results were favourable for them, their not being the first to make the attack, and voluntarily to begin an engagement with all its hazard, (since, at any rate, they had clearly shown that they were ready to defend themselves,) and the victory's being fairly assigned to them, without any struggle, so to speak; and that at the same time it was favourable to their interest at Megara.


4.73.3
2995
εἰ μὲν γὰρ μὴ ὤφθησαν ἐλθόντες , οὐκ ἂν ἐν τύχῃ γίγνεσθαι σφίσιν , ἀλλὰ σαφῶς ἂν ὥσπερ ἡσσηθέντων στερηθῆναι εὐθὺς τῆς πόλεως ·
For if they had not shown themselves there, they would not have had a chance, but would certainly have lost the city, being considered as good as beaten.


4.73.3
2996
νῦν δὲ κἂν τυχεῖν αὐτοὺς Ἀθηναίους μὴ βουληθέντας ἀγωνίζεσθαι , ὥστε ἀμαχητὶ ἂν περιγενέσθαι αὐτοῖς ὧν ἕνεκα ἦλθον .
But as it was, the Athenians might happen to be not disposed for a contest; so that without fighting they would succeed in the objects of their coming.


4.73.3
2997
ὅπερ καὶ ἐγένετο .
And this was indeed the case.


4.73.4
2998
οἱ γὰρ Μεγαρῆς , ὡς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐτάξαντο μὲν παρὰ τὰ μακρὰ τείχη ἐξελθόντες , ἡσύχαζον δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ μὴ ἐπιόντων , λογιζόμενοι καὶ οἱ ἐκείνων στρατηγοὶ μὴ ἀντίπαλον εἶναι σφίσι τὸν κίνδυνον , ἐπειδὴ καὶ τὰ πλείω αὐτοῖς προυκεχωρήκει , ἄρξασι μάχης πρὸς πλέονας αὐτῶν ἢ λαβεῖν νικήσαντας Μέγαρα ἢ σφαλέντας τῷ βελτίστῳ τοῦ ὁπλιτικοῦ βλαφθῆναι , τοῖς δὲ ξυμπάσης τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ τῶν παρόντων μέρος ἕκαστον κινδυνεύειν εἰκότως ἐθέλειν τολμᾶν , χρόνον δὲ ἐπισχόντες καὶ ὡς οὐδὲν ἀφ’ ἑκατέρων ἐπεχειρεῖτο , ἀπῆλθον πρότερον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὴν Νίσαιαν καὶ αὖθις οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ὅθενπερ ὡρμήθησαν .
For the Athenians came out, and drew up by the long walls, but remained quiet on their side also, as the enemy did not attack them: since their commanders too considered it no equal hazard, on the one hand for them, after succeeding in most of their designs, to commence an engagement against superior numbers, and either, if victorious, only to take Megara, or, if beaten, to sacrifice the flower of their heavy-soldiery;


4.73.4
2999
οὕτω δὴ τῷ μὲν Βρασίδᾳ αὐτῷ καὶ τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων ἄρχουσιν οἱ τῶν φευγόντων φίλοι Μεγαρῆς , ὡς ἐπικρατήσαντι καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων οὐκέτι ἐθελησάντων μάχεσθαι , θαρσοῦντες μᾶλλον ἀνοίγουσί τε τὰς πύλας καὶ δεξάμενοι καταπεπληγμένων ἤδη τῶν πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους πραξάντων ἐς λόγους ἔρχονται .
And, on the other hand, for merely a part of their enemies' whole force, nay even of that which was present in each case, to be willing, as they reasonably might, with boldness to risk a battle. So when, after waiting some time and no attack being made on either side, the Athenians first returned to Nisaea, and then the Peloponnesians to the point they had set out from; under these circumstances the friends of the Megarean exiles with greater confidence threw open the gates to Brasidas and the commanders from the different states, (considering that he had proved his superior strength, and that the Athenians had no longer been willing to fight,) and having received them, proceeded to confer with them, while those who had negotiated with the Athenians were now confounded.


4.74.1
3000
καὶ ὕστερον ὁ μὲν διαλυθέντων τῶν ξυμμάχων κατὰ πόλεις ἐπανελθὼν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον τὴν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης στρατείαν παρεσκεύαζεν , ἵναπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ὥρμητο ·
Afterwards, when Brasidas had dismissed the allies to their several cities, he himself went back to Corinth, and prepared for his expedition to Thrace, which was his original destination.


4.74.2
3001
οἱ δὲ ἐν τῇ πόλει Μεγαρῆς , ἀποχωρησάντων καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπ’ οἴκου , ὅσοι μὲν τῶν πραγμάτων πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μάλιστα μετέσχον , εἰδότες ὅτι ὤφθησαν εὐθὺς ὑπεξῆλθον , οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι κοινολογησάμενοι τοῖς τῶν φευγόντων φίλοις κατάγουσι τοὺς ἐκ Πηγῶν , ὁρκώσαντες πίστεσι μεγάλαις μηδὲν μνησικακήσειν , βουλεύσειν δὲ τῇ πόλει τὰ ἄριστα .
When the Athenians also had returned home, such of the Megareans in the city as had been most implicated in the negotiations with them, knowing that they had been marked, immediately stole away; while the rest, having conferred with the friends of the exiles, restored the party at Pegae, after binding them by solemn oaths to forget the past, and to advise what was best for the city.


4.74.3
3002
οἱ δὲ ἐπειδὴ ἐν ταῖς ἀρχαῖς ἐγένοντο καὶ ἐξέτασιν ὅπλων ἐποιήσαντο , διαστήσαντες τοὺς λόχους ἐξελέξαντο τῶν τε ἐχθρῶν καὶ οἳ ἐδόκουν μάλιστα ξυμπρᾶξαι τὰ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἄνδρας ὡς ἑκατόν , καὶ τούτων πέρι ἀναγκάσαντες τὸν δῆμον ψῆφον φανερὰν διενεγκεῖν , ὡς κατεγνώσθησαν , ἔκτειναν , καὶ ἐς ὀλιγαρχίαν τὰ μάλιστα κατέστησαν τὴν πόλιν .
When, however, they had been put in office, and held a review of the heavy-armed troops, having separated the battalions, they selected a hundred of their enemies, and of those who appeared to have joined most decidedly in the negotiations with the Athenians; and having compelled the commons to pass an open sentence upon them, on their being condemned, they put them to death, and established a thorough oligarchy in the city.


4.74.4
3003
καὶ πλεῖστον δὴ χρόνον αὕτη ὑπ’ ἐλαχίστων γενομένη ἐκ στάσεως μετάστασις ξυνέμεινεν .
And this change of government lasted a very long time, though effected by a very few men through the triumph of a faction.


4.75.1
3004
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους τῆς Ἀντάνδρου ὑπὸ τῶν Μυτιληναίων , ὥσπερ διενοοῦντο , μελλούσης κατασκευάζεσθαι , οἱ τῶν ἀργυρολόγων νεῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοὶ Δημόδοκος καὶ Ἀριστείδης , ὄντες περὶ Ἑλλήσποντον ( ὁ γὰρ τρίτος αὐτῶν Λάμαχος δέκα ναυσὶν ἐς τὸν Πόντον ἐσεπεπλεύκει ) ὡς ᾐσθάνοντο τὴν παρασκευὴν τοῦ χωρίου καὶ ἐδόκει αὐτοῖς δεινὸν εἶναι μὴ ὥσπερ τὰ Ἄναια ἐπὶ τῇ Σάμῳ γένηται , ἔνθα οἱ φεύγοντες τῶν Σαμίων καταστάντες τούς τε Πελοποννησίους ὠφέλουν ἐς τὰ ναυτικὰ κυβερνήτας πέμποντες καὶ τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει Σαμίους ἐς ταραχὴν καθίστασαν καὶ τοὺς ἐξιόντας ἐδέχοντο ·
The same summer, when Antandrus was going to be strengthened by the Mytilenaeans, as they were planning [when we last mentioned them], Demodocus and Aristides, the commanders of the ships sent to levy contributions, being about the Hellespont, (for Lamachus, their third colleague, had sailed with ten ships into the Pontus,) became aware of the provisions made for the place, and thinking there was danger of its becoming what Anaea was to Samos—where the Samian exiles had established themselves, and both assisted the Peloponnesians by sending pilates to their squadrons, and threw the Samians in the city into confusion, and received those who deserted them.


4.75.1
3005
οὕτω δὴ ξυναγείραντες ἀπὸ τῶν ξυμμάχων στρατιὰν καὶ πλεύσαντες , μάχῃ τε νικήσαντες τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Ἀντάνδρου ἐπεξελθόντας , ἀναλαμβάνουσι τὸ χωρίον πάλιν .
On these grounds they collected a force from the allies and set sail, and having defeated in a battle those who came out from Antandrus against them, retook the place.


4.75.2
3006
καὶ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ἐς τὸν Πόντον ἐσπλεύσας Λάμαχος , ἐν τῇ Ἡρακλεώτιδι ὁρμίσας ἐς τὸν Κάλητα ποταμὸν ἀπόλλυσι τὰς ναῦς ὕδατος ἄνωθεν γενομένου καὶ κατελθόντος αἰφνιδίου τοῦ ῥεύματος ·
Not long after, Lamachus, who had sailed into the Pontus, having anchored in the river Calex, in the territory of Heraclea, lost his ships in consequence of a rain in the interior, and the flood coming suddenly down upon them.


4.75.2
3007
αὐτὸς δὲ καὶ ἡ στρατιὰ πεζῇ διὰ Βιθυνῶν Θρᾳκῶν , οἵ εἰσι πέραν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ , ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Καλχηδόνα τὴν ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ Πόντου Μεγαρέων ἀποικίαν .
He himself and his troops went by land through the Bithynian Thracians, who are situated across the strait in Asia, to Chalcedon, the Megarean colony at the mouth of the Pontus.


4.76.1
3008
ἐν δὲ τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει καὶ Δημοσθένης Ἀθηναίων στρατηγὸς τεσσαράκοντα ναυσὶν ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Ναύπακτον , εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν ἐκ τῆς Μεγαρίδος ἀναχώρησιν .
The same summer Demosthenes, the Athenian general, went to Naupactus with forty ships immediately after the return from the Megarid.


4.76.2
3009
τῷ γὰρ Ἱπποκράτει καὶ ἐκείνῳ τὰ Βοιώτια πράγματα ἀπό τινων ἀνδρῶν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν ἐπράσσετο , βουλομένων μεταστῆσαι τὸν κόσμον καὶ ἐς δημοκρατίαν ὥσπερ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τρέψαι ·
For communications respecting the affairs of Boeotia were being carried on with Hippocrates and him by certain men in the cities, who wished to change the constitution, and to bring them under a democracy like that of Athens;


4.76.2
3010
καὶ Πτοιοδώρου μάλιστ’ ἀνδρὸς φυγάδος ἐκ Θηβῶν ἐσηγουμένου τάδε αὐτοῖς παρεσκευάσθη .
it being especially under the direction of Ptoeodorus, an exile from Thebes, that these preparations were made by them.


4.76.3
3011
Σίφας μὲν ἔμελλόν τινες προδώσειν ( αἱ δὲ Σῖφαί εἰσι τῆς Θεσπικῆς γῆς ἐν τῷ Κρισαίῳ κόλπῳ ἐπιθαλασσίδιοι ) ·
A party was to betray to them Siphae, a seaport town in the Thespian territory, on the Crisaean Bay;


4.76.3
3012
Χαιρώνειαν δέ , ἣ ἐς Ὀρχομενὸν τὸν Μινύειον πρότερον καλούμενον , νῦν δὲ Βοιώτιον , ξυντελεῖ , ἄλλοι ἐξ Ὀρχομενοῦ ἐνεδίδοσαν , καὶ οἱ Ὀρχομενίων φυγάδες ξυνέπρασσον τὰ μάλιστα καὶ ἄνδρας ἐμισθοῦντο ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ( ἔστι δὲ ἡ Χαιρώνεια ἔσχατον τῆς Βοιωτίας πρὸς τῇ Φανοτίδι τῆς Φωκίδος ) , καὶ Φωκέων μετεῖχόν τινες .
While Chaeronea, which was dependent on what was formerly called the Minyan, but now the Boeotian Orchomenus, was to be delivered up by another party in that city; the exiles from it also co-operating most warmly, and raising mercenary troops from the Peloponnese. Chaeronea is the frontier town too of Boeotia, near to Phanotis in Phocis, and a party of Phocians joined in the design. On the other hand, the Athenians were to seize Delium, the sanctuary of Apollo in the territory of Tanagra, looking towards Euboea;


4.76.4
3013
τοὺς δὲ Ἀθηναίους ἔδει Δήλιον καταλαβεῖν τὸ ἐν τῇ Ταναγραίᾳ πρὸς Εὔβοιαν τετραμμένον Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερόν , ἅμα δὲ ταῦτα ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ῥητῇ γίγνεσθαι , ὅπως μὴ ξυμβοηθήσωσιν ἐπὶ τὸ Δήλιον οἱ Βοιωτοὶ ἁθρόοι , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν ἕκαστοι κινούμενα .
and these measures were to be simultaneously executed on the same day; that the Boeotians might not oppose them in a body at Delium, but have to attend to their own respective neighbourhoods that were being revolutionized.


4.76.5
3014
καὶ εἰ κατορθοῖτο ἡ πεῖρα καὶ τὸ Δήλιον τειχισθείη , ῥᾳδίως ἤλπιζον , εἰ καὶ μὴ παραυτίκα νεωτερίζοιτό τι τῶν κατὰ τὰς πολιτείας τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς , ἐχομένων τούτων τῶν χωρίων καὶ λῃστευομένης τῆς γῆς καὶ οὔσης ἑκάστοις διὰ βραχέος ἀποστροφῆς , οὐ μενεῖν κατὰ χώραν τὰ πράγματα , ἀλλὰ χρόνῳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων μὲν προσιόντων τοῖς ἀφεστηκόσι , τοῖς δὲ οὐκ οὔσης ἁθρόας τῆς δυνάμεως , καταστήσειν αὐτὰ ἐς τὸ ἐπιτήδειον .
And should the attempt succeed, and Delium be fortified, they confidently hoped, that even if no change in their constitution were immediately made by the Boeotians, yet when these posts were occupied by Athenian garrisons, and the land was being plundered, and the several parties had a rallying place close at hand, that things would not remain in their present position, but that, in the course of time, when the Athenians supported the disaffected, and the power of the oligarchs was disunited, they would settle them to their own advantage. Such then was the design in preparation.


4.77.1
3015
ἡ μὲν οὖν ἐπιβουλὴ τοιαύτη παρεσκευάζετο , ὁ δὲ Ἱπποκράτης αὐτὸς μὲν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως δύναμιν ἔχων , ὁπότε καιρὸς εἴη , ἔμελλε στρατεύειν ἐς τοὺς Βοιωτούς , τὸν δὲ Δημοσθένη προαπέστειλε ταῖς τεσσαράκοντα ναυσὶν ἐς τὴν Ναύπακτον , ὅπως ἐξ ἐκείνων τῶν χωρίων στρατὸν ξυλλέξας Ἀκαρνάνων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων πλέοι ἐπὶ τὰς Σίφας ὡς προδοθησομένας ·
Now Hippocrates himself, with a force raised at home, was ready, when the time came, to take the field against the Boeotians;


4.77.1
3016
ἡμέρα δ’ αὐτοῖς εἴρητο ᾗ ἔδει ἅμα ταῦτα πράσσειν .
But Demosthenes he sent on before, with the forty ships mentioned, to Naupactus; that after raising in those quarters an army of Acamanians and the other allies, he might sail to Siphae, in expectation of its being betrayed to him: and the day had been fixed between them on which they were simultaneously to carry out these plans.


4.77.2
3017
καὶ ὁ μὲν Δημοσθένης ἀφικόμενος , Οἰνιάδας δὲ ὑπό τε Ἀκαρνάνων πάντων κατηναγκασμένους καταλαβὼν ἐς τὴν Ἀθηναίων ξυμμαχίαν καὶ αὐτὸς ἀναστήσας τὸ ξυμμαχικὸν τὸ ἐκείνῃ πᾶν , ἐπὶ Σαλύνθιον καὶ Ἀγραίους στρατεύσας πρῶτον καὶ προσποιησάμενος τ- ἄλλα ἡτοιμάζετο ὡς ἐπὶ τὰς Σίφας , ὅταν δέῃ , ἀπαντησόμενος .
Accordingly, Demosthenes went to Naupactus, and finding $Aeniadae compelled by all the Acarnanians to join the Athenian confederacy, and having himself raised all the allies on that side, and marched first against Salynthius and the Agraeans, and reduced them to subjection, he proceeded to make his other preparations for going at the proper time to Siphae.


4.78.1
3018
Βρασίδας δὲ κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον τοῦ θέρους πορευόμενος ἑπτακοσίοις καὶ χιλίοις ὁπλίταις ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ἐπειδὴ ἐγένετο ἐν Ἡρακλείᾳ τῇ ἐν Τραχῖνι καί , προπέμψαντος αὐτοῦ ἄγγελον ἐς Φάρσαλον παρὰ τοὺς ἐπιτηδείους , ἀξιοῦντος διάγειν ἑαυτὸν καὶ τὴν στρατιάν , ἦλθον ἐς Μελίτειαν τῆς Ἀχαΐας Πάναιρός τε καὶ Δῶρος καὶ Ἱππολοχίδας καὶ Τορύλαος καὶ Στρόφακος πρόξενος ὢν Χαλκιδέων , τότε δὴ ἐπορεύετο .
About the same part of the summer, when Brasidas, being on his march with one thousand seven hundred heavy-armed to the Thrace-ward countries, had come to Heraclea in Trachinia; and when, on his sending before him a messenger to his partisans in Pharsalus, and requesting them to conduct himself and his army through the country, there came to Melitia, in Achaia, Panaerus, Dorus, Hippolochidas, Torylaus, and Strophacus, who was  to the Chalcidians.


4.78.2
3019
ἦγον δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι Θεσσαλῶν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐκ Λαρίσης Νικονίδας Περδίκκᾳ ἐπιτήδειος ὤν .
Upon that he proceeded on his march, being conducted both by other Thessalians, and especially by Niconidas of Larissa, who was a friend of Perdiccas.


4.78.2
3020
τὴν γὰρ Θεσσαλίαν ἄλλως τε οὐκ εὔπορον ἦν διιέναι ἄνευ ἀγωγοῦ καὶ μετὰ ὅπλων γε δή , καὶ τοῖς πᾶσί γε ὁμοίως Ἕλλησιν ὕποπτον καθειστήκει τὴν τῶν πέλας μὴ πείσαντας διιέναι ·
For on other grounds it was not easy to pass through Thessaly without an escort, and with an armed force, especially, to pass through a neighbour's country without having obtained his consent, was regarded with suspicion by all the Greeks alike.


4.78.2
3021
τοῖς τε Ἀθηναίοις αἰεί ποτε τὸ πλῆθος τῶν Θεσσαλῶν εὔνουν ὑπῆρχεν .
Besides, the great mass of the Thessalians had always been on friendly terms with Athens;


4.78.3
3022
ὥστε εἰ μὴ δυναστείᾳ μᾶλλον ἢ ἰσονομίᾳ ἐχρῶντο τὸ ἐγχώριον οἱ Θεσσαλοί , οὐκ ἄν ποτε προῆλθεν , ἐπεὶ καὶ τότε πορευομένῳ αὐτῷ ἀπαντήσαντες ἄλλοι τῶν τ- ἐναντία τούτοις βουλομένων ἐπὶ τῷ Ἐνιπεῖ ποταμῷ ἐκώλυον καὶ ἀδικεῖν ἔφασαν ἄνευ τοῦ πάντων κοινοῦ πορευόμενον .
so that, had not Thessaly, by the constitution of their country, been under the dominion of a few individuals, rather than in the enjoyment of civil equality, he would never have made his way; since even as it was, another party, of contrary views to those who have been named, met him on his march on the river Enipeus, and tried to stop him, telling him that he did wrong in advancing without the national consent.


4.78.4
3023
οἱ δὲ ἄγοντες οὔτε ἀκόντων ἔφασαν διάξειν , αἰφνίδιόν τε παραγενόμενον ξένοι ὄντες κομίζειν .
But his conductors said that they would not escort him against their will, and that they were only attending him as friends, on his unexpectedly coming to them.


4.78.4
3024
ἔλεγε δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ Βρασίδας τῇ Θεσσαλῶν γῇ καὶ αὐτοῖς φίλος ὢν ἰέναι καὶ Ἀθηναίοις πολεμίοις οὖσι καὶ οὐκ ἐκείνοις ὅπλα ἐπιφέρειν , Θεσσαλοῖς τε οὐκ εἰδέναι καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις ἔχθραν οὖσαν ὥστε τῇ ἀλλήλων γῇ μὴ χρῆσθαι , νῦν τε ἀκόντων ἐκείνων οὐκ ἂν προελθεῖν ( οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν δύνασθαι ) , οὐ μέντοι ἀξιοῦν γε εἴργεσθαι .
Brasidas himself also told them that he came as a friend both to the country of the Thessalians and to themselves, and was bringing his forces against the Athenians, who were at war with his country, and not against them; nor did he know of any enmity existing between the Thessalians and the Lacedaemonians, to prevent their having access to each other's territory:


4.78.5
3025
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀκούσαντες ταῦτα ἀπῆλθον , ὁ δὲ κελευόντων τῶν ἀγωγῶν , πρίν τι πλέον ξυστῆναι τὸ κωλῦσον , ἐχώρει οὐδὲν ἐπισχὼν δρόμῳ .
After hearing this, they went away; and he, without halting at all, pushed on at a rapid pace, according to the advice of his conductors, before a greater force might be collected to stop him.

3026
καὶ ταύτῃ μὲν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ , ᾗ ἐκ τῆς Μελιτείας ἀφώρμησεν , ἐς Φάρσαλόν τε ἐτέλεσε καὶ ἐστρατοπεδεύσατο ἐπὶ τῷ Ἀπιδανῷ ποταμῷ , ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ἐς Φάκιον , καὶ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐς Περραιβίαν .
And so on the day of his setting out from Melitia he performed the whole distance to Pharsalus, and encamped on the river Apidanus; from there he went to Phacium, and from there to Perrhaebia.


4.78.6
3027
ἀπὸ δὲ τούτου ἤδη οἱ μὲν τῶν Θεσσαλῶν ἀγωγοὶ πάλιν ἀπῆλθον , οἱ δὲ Περραιβοὶ αὐτόν , ὑπήκοοι ὄντες Θεσσαλῶν , κατέστησαν ἐς Δῖον τῆς Περδίκκου ἀρχῆς , ὃ ὑπὸ τῷ Ὀλύμπῳ Μακεδονίας πρὸς Θεσσαλοὺς πόλισμα κεῖται .
thence to Phacium, and thence to Peraebia. At that point his Thessalian escort returned; but the Peraxbians, who were subject to the Thessalians, brought him to Dium, in the dominions of Perdiccas, a town of Macedonia lying under Mount Olympus, on the side of Thessaly.


4.79.1
3028
τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ Βρασίδας Θεσσαλίαν φθάσας διέδραμε πρίν τινα κωλύειν παρασκευάσασθαι , καὶ ἀφίκετο ὡς Περδίκκαν καὶ ἐς τὴν Χαλκιδικήν .
In this way Brasidas stole a rapid march through Thessaly, before any one was prepared to stop him, and reached Perdiccas and Chalcidice.


4.79.2
3029
ἐκ γὰρ τῆς Πελοποννήσου , ὡς τὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ηὐτύχει , δείσαντες οἵ τε ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ἀφεστῶτες Ἀθηναίων καὶ Περδίκκας ἐξήγαγον τὸν στρατόν , οἱ μὲν Χαλκιδῆς νομίζοντες ἐπὶ σφᾶς πρῶτον ὁρμήσειν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ( καὶ ἅμα αἱ πλησιόχωροι πόλεις αὐτῶν αἱ οὐκ ἀφεστηκυῖαι ξυνεπῆγον κρύφα ) , Περδίκκας δὲ πολέμιος μὲν οὐκ ὢν ἐκ τοῦ φανεροῦ , φοβούμενος δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς τὰ παλαιὰ διάφορα τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ μάλιστα βουλόμενος Ἀρραβαῖον τὸν Λυγκηστῶν βασιλέα παραστήσασθαι .
For what brought the army up out of the Peloponnese, while the affairs of Athens were so prosperous, was the fear of the Thrace-ward cities which had revolted from the Athenians, and that of Perdiccas:


4.79.3
3030
ξυνέβη δὲ αὐτοῖς , ὥστε ῥᾷον ἐκ τῆς Πελοποννήσου στρατὸν ἐξαγαγεῖν , ἡ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἐν τῷ παρόντι κακοπραγία .
the Chalcidians thinking that the Athenians would in the first place march against them, (and moreover, the cities near to them which had not revolted, secretly joined in the invitation,) and Perdiccas, though not an open enemy, yet being afraid, on his part also, because of his old quarrels with the Athenians, and most of all being desirous of reducing to subjection Arrhibaeus, the king of the Lyncestians.


4.80.1
3031
τῶν γὰρ Ἀθηναίων ἐγκειμένων τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα τῇ ἐκείνων γῇ ἤλπιζον ἀποτρέψειν αὐτοὺς μάλιστα , εἰ ἀντιπαραλυποῖεν πέμψαντες ἐπὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους αὐτῶν στρατιάν , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἑτοίμων ὄντων τρέφειν τε καὶ ἐπὶ ἀποστάσει σφᾶς ἐπικαλουμένων .
And what contributed to their getting the army out of the Peloponnese the more easily, was the misfortune of the Lacedaemonians at that time. For as the Athenians were pressing hard upon the Peloponnese, and especially upon  territory, they hoped to divert them from it most effectually, if they annoyed them in return by sending an army to their allies; especially as they were ready to maintain it, and were calling them to their aid, with a view to revolting.


4.80.2
3032
καὶ ἅμα τῶν Εἱλώτων βουλομένοις ἦν ἐπὶ προφάσει ἐκπέμψαι , μή τι πρὸς τὰ παρόντα τῆς Πύλου ἐχομένης νεωτερίσωσιν ·
Besides, they were glad to have a pretext for sending away some of the Helots; lest in the present state of affairs, when Pylus was occupied by an enemy, they might attempt some revolution.


4.80.3
3033
ἐπεὶ καὶ τόδε ἔπραξαν φοβούμενοι αὐτῶν τὴν σκαιότητα καὶ τὸ πλῆθος ( αἰεὶ γὰρ τὰ πολλὰ Λακεδαιμονίοις πρὸς τοὺς Εἵλωτας τῆς φυλακῆς πέρι μάλιστα καθειστήκει ) ·
Indeed through fear of their youth and great numbers, they even perpetrated the following deed: (for at all times most of the Lacedaemonian institutions were framed particularly with a view to the Helots, to guard against them.)


4.80.3
3034
προεῖπον αὐτῶν ὅσοι ἀξιοῦσιν ἐν τοῖς πολέμοις γεγενῆσθαι σφίσιν ἄριστοι ,κρίνεσθαι , ὡς ἐλευθερώσοντες , πεῖραν ποιούμενοι καὶ ἡγούμενοι τούτους σφίσιν ὑπὸ φρονήματος , οἵπερ καὶ ἠξίωσαν πρῶτος ἕκαστος ἐλευθεροῦσθαι , μάλιστα ἂν καὶ ἐπιθέσθαι .
They made proclamation, that as many of them as claimed to have done the state most service against the enemy should be picked out, professing that they would give them their liberty; thus applying a test to them, and thinking that those who severally claimed to be first made free, would also, through their high spirit, be most ready to attack them.


4.80.4
3035
καὶ προκρίναντες ἐς δισχιλίους , οἱ μὲν ἐστεφανώσαντό τε καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ περιῆλθον ὡς ἠλευθερωμένοι , οἱ δὲ οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον ἠφάνισάν τε αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐδεὶς ᾔσθετο ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἕκαστος διεφθάρη .
Having thus selected as many as two thousand, the Helots crowned themselves, and went round to the temples, on the strength of having gained their freedom; but the Spartans soon after did away with them, and no one ever knew by what means they were severally dispatched. And on this occasion they eagerly sent away seven hundred of them with Brasidas as heavy-armed troops:


4.80.5
3036
καὶ τότε προθύμως τῷ Βρασίδᾳ αὐτῶν ξυνέπεμψαν ἑπτακοσίους ὁπλίτας , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους ἐκ τῆς Πελοποννήσου μισθῷ πείσας ἐξήγαγεν .
the rest of his army he induced by pay to follow him from the Peloponnese. As for Brasidas himself, it was chiefly at his own desire that the Lacedaemonians sent him out.


4.81.1
3037
αὐτόν τε Βρασίδαν βουλόμενον μάλιστα Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀπέστειλαν ( προυθυμήθησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Χαλκιδῆς ) , ἄνδρα ἔν τε τῇ Σπάρτῃ δοκοῦντα δραστήριον εἶναι ἐς τὰ πάντα καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐξῆλθε πλείστου ἄξιον Λακεδαιμονίοις γενόμενον .
But the Chalcidians were also very anxious to have him, as a man who both appeared, while in Sparta, to be active in every thing, and after he had gone from home, proved himself most valuable to the Lacedaemonians.


4.81.2
3038
τό τε γὰρ παραυτίκα ἑαυτὸν παρασχὼν δίκαιον καὶ μέτριον ἐς τὰς πόλεις ἀπέστησε τὰ πολλά , τὰ δὲ προδοσίᾳ εἷλε τῶν χωρίων , ὥστε τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις γίγνεσθαι ξυμβαίνειν τε βουλομένοις , ὅπερ ἐποίησαν , ἀνταπόδοσιν καὶ ἀποδοχὴν χωρίων καὶ τοῦ πολέμου ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου λώφησιν ·
For at that present time, by showing himself just and moderate towards the cities, he caused their revolt in most instances;


4.81.2
3039
ἔς τε τὸν χρόνῳ ὕστερον μετὰ τὰ ἐκ Σικελίας πόλεμον ἡ τότε Βρασίδου ἀρετὴ καὶ ξύνεσις , τῶν μὲν πείρᾳ αἰσθομένων , τῶν δὲ ἀκοῇ νομισάντων , μάλιστα ἐπιθυμίαν ἐνεποίει τοῖς Ἀθηναίων ξυμμάχοις ἐς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους .
While other places he took through their being betrayed to him; so that the Lacedaemonians, if they might wish to conclude peace, (as they did,) had towns to give and receive back, and a respite from the war in the Peloponnese. And at a later period of the war, after what had happened in Sicily, it was the probity and tact of Brasidas at this time, experienced by some and heard of by others, that most raised amongst the allies of Athens a strong inclination towards the Lacedaemonians.


4.81.3
3040
πρῶτος γὰρ ἐξελθὼν καὶ δόξας εἶναι κατὰ πάντα ἀγαθὸς ἐλπίδα ἐγκατέλιπε βέβαιον ὡς καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι τοιοῦτοί εἰσιν .
For by going out first, and showing himself to be in all respects a worthy man, he left amongst them an assured hope that the rest also were like him.


4.82.1
3041
τότε δ’ οὖν ἀφικομένου αὐτοῦ ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι πυθόμενοι τόν τε Περδίκκαν πολέμιον ποιοῦνται , νομίσαντες αἴτιον εἶναι τῆς παρόδου , καὶ τῶν ταύτῃ ξυμμάχων φυλακὴν πλέονα κατεστήσαντο .
On his arrival then at this time in the countries Thrace-ward, the Athenians, when they heard it, declared war against Perdiccas, thinking that he was the cause of his march thither; and kept a closer watch over their allies in that quarter.


4.83.1
3042
Περδίκκας δὲ Βρασίδαν καὶ τὴν στρατιὰν εὐθὺς λαβὼν μετὰ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ δυνάμεως στρατεύει ἐπὶ Ἀρραβαῖον τὸν Βρομεροῦ Λυγκηστῶν Μακεδόνων βασιλέα ὅμορον ὄντα , διαφορᾶς τε αὐτῷ οὔσης καὶ βουλόμενος καταστρέψασθαι .
Perdiccas immediately took Brasidas and his army, and led them with his own forces against Arrhibaeus the son of Bromerus, king of the Lyncestian Macedonians, whose territory bordered on his own; for he had a quarrel with him, and wished to reduce him to subjection.


4.83.2
3043
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐγένετο τῷ στρατῷ μετὰ τοῦ Βρασίδου ἐπὶ τῇ ἐσβολῇ τῆς Λύγκου , Βρασίδας λόγοις ἔφη βούλεσθαι πρῶτον ἐλθὼν πρὸ πολέμου Ἀρραβαῖον ξύμμαχον Λακεδαιμονίων , ἢν δύνηται , ποιῆσαι .
But when he had come with his army, accompanied by Brasidas, to the pass into Lyncus, Brasidas told him that he wished to go, before hostilities were commenced, and by means of words bring Arrhibaeus into alliance with the Lacedaemonians, if he could.


4.83.3
3044
καὶ γάρ τι καὶ Ἀρραβαῖος ἐπεκηρυκεύετο , ἑτοῖμος ὢν Βρασίδᾳ μέσῳ δικαστῇ ἐπιτρέπειν ·
Indeed Arrhibaeus sent a herald to make some advances, being willing to refer the matter to Brasidas as an arbitrator between them:


4.83.3
3045
καὶ οἱ Χαλκιδέων πρέσβεις ξυμπαρόντες ἐδίδασκον αὐτὸν μὴ ὑπεξελεῖν τῷ Περδίκκᾳ τὰ δεινά , ἵνα προθυμοτέρῳ ἔχοιεν καὶ ἐς τὰ ἑαυτῶν χρῆσθαι .
And the Chalcidian envoys who were with him, advised him not to remove the apprehensions of Perdiccas, that they might be able to command his more hearty assistance in their own affairs also.


4.83.4
3046
ἅμα δέ τι καὶ εἰρήκεσαν τοιοῦτον οἱ παρὰ τοῦ Περδίκκου ἐν τῇ Λακεδαίμονι , ὡς πολλὰ αὐτοῖς τῶν περὶ αὑτὸν χωρίων ξύμμαχα ποιήσοι , ὥστε ἐκ τοῦ τοιούτου κοινῇ μᾶλλον ὁ Βρασίδας τὰ τοῦ Ἀρραβαίου ἠξίου πράσσειν .
Besides, the envoys from Perdiccas had made at Lacedaemon a declaration to this effect, that he would bring many places around him into alliance with them; so that Brasidas, on the strength of this, thought himself entitled to arrange the affairs of Arrhibaeus in common with Perdiccas, rather than leave them to him alone.


4.83.5
3047
Περδίκκας δὲ οὔτε δικαστὴν ἔφη Βρασίδαν τῶν σφετέρων διαφορῶν ἀγαγεῖν , μᾶλλον δὲ καθαιρέτην ὧν ἂν αὐτὸς ἀποφαίνῃ πολεμίων , ἀδικήσειν τε εἰ αὐτοῦ τρέφοντος τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ στρατοῦ ξυνέσται Ἀρραβαίῳ .
But Perdiccas said that he had not taken Brasidas as an arbitrator in their disputes, but rather to destroy the enemies he should point out to him; and, that he would act unjustly. if, while he supported half his army, he should hold a conference with Arrhibaeus.


4.83.6
3048
ὁ δὲ ἄκοντος καὶ ἐκ διαφορᾶς ξυγγίγνεται , καὶ πεισθεὶς τοῖς λόγοις ἀπήγαγε τὴν στρατιὰν πρὶν ἐσβαλεῖν ἐς τὴν χώραν .
But Brasidas, against the king's will, and after a quarrel with him, had a meeting with Arrhibaeus, and being persuaded by his arguments, drew off the army before they entered his country.


4.83.6
3049
Περδίκκας δὲ μετὰ τοῦτο τρίτον μέρος ἀνθ’ ἡμίσεος τῆς τροφῆς ἐδίδου , νομίζων ἀδικεῖσθαι .
And Perdiccas after this supplied but a third, instead of half, towards the support of the army, considering himself to be aggrieved.


4.84.1
3050
ἐν δὲ τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει εὐθὺς ὁ Βρασίδας ἔχων καὶ Χαλκιδέας ἐπὶ Ἄκανθον τὴν Ἀνδρίων ἀποικίαν ὀλίγον πρὸ τρυγήτου ἐστράτευσεν .
The same summer, Brasidas, accompanied by the Chalcidians, immediately made an expedition against Acanthus, the colony of the Andrians, a little before the vintage.


4.84.2
3051
οἱ δὲ περὶ τοῦ δέχεσθαι αὐτὸν κατ’ ἀλλήλους ἐστασίαζον , οἵ τε μετὰ τῶν Χαλκιδέων ξυνεπάγοντες καὶ ὁ δῆμος .
The people there were divided into parties amongst themselves on the subject of receiving him, those who with the Chalcidians joined in inviting him, and the commons [who were opposed to it].


4.84.2
3052
ὅμως δὲ διὰ τοῦ καρποῦ τὸ δέος ἔτι ἔξω ὄντος πεισθὲν τὸ πλῆθος ὑπὸ τοῦ Βρασίδου δέξασθαί τε αὐτὸν μόνον καὶ ἀκούσαντας βουλεύσασθαι , δέχεται ·
Nevertheless, through fear for their fruit, which was still out, when the commons were urged by Brasidas to admit him alone, and to decide after hearing him, they admitted him.


4.84.2
3053
καὶ καταστὰς ἐπὶ τὸ πλῆθος ( ἦν δὲ οὐδὲ ἀδύνατος , ὡς Λακεδαιμόνιος , εἰπεῖν ) ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
And coming forward to speak to the people, (being, for a Lacedaemonian, not deficient in eloquence,) he addressed them as follows:


4.85.1
3054
&quot; ἡ μὲν ἔκπεμψίς μου καὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων , ὦ Ἀκάνθιοι , γεγένηται τὴν αἰτίαν ἐπαληθεύουσα ἣν ἀρχόμενοι τοῦ πολέμου προείπομεν , Ἀθηναίοις ἐλευθεροῦντες τὴν Ἑλλάδα πολεμήσειν ·
"The sending out, Acanthians, of myself and my army by the Lacedaemonians, has been executed to verify the reason we alleged for hostilities at the commencement of them, viz. that to liberate Greece we should go to war with the Athenians.


4.85.2
3055
εἰ δὲ χρόνῳ ἐπήλθομεν , σφαλέντες τῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐκεῖ πολέμου δόξης , ᾗ διὰ τάχους αὐτοὶ ἄνευ τοῦ ὑμετέρου κινδύνου ἠλπίσαμεν Ἀθηναίους καθαιρήσειν , μηδεὶς μεμφθῇ ·
And if we have been long in coming to you, through being disappointed in our expectation regarding the war in those parts, according to which we hoped quickly by ourselves, and without any risk on your part, to overthrow the Athenians, let no one find fault with us;


4.85.2
3056
νῦν γάρ , ὅτε παρέσχεν , ἀφιγμένοι καὶ μετὰ ὑμῶν πειρασόμεθα κατεργάζεσθαι αὐτούς .
For now, when we had an opportunity, we are come, and will endeavour, in concert with you, to subdue them. But I am astonished at my being shut out of your gates, and that my arrival should be unwelcome to any of you.


4.85.3
3057
θαυμάζω δὲ τῇ τε ἀποκλῄσει μου τῶν πυλῶν , καὶ εἰ μὴ ἀσμένοις ὑμῖν ἀφῖγμαι .
For we Lacedaemonians, as thinking that we should come to men who in feeling, at any rate, were on our side, even before we actually joined them, and that we should be welcome to you, ran the great risk of making a march of many days through the country of strangers, and evinced all possible zeal:


4.85.4
3058
ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οἰόμενοί τε παρὰ ξυμμάχους , καὶ πρὶν ἔργῳ ἀφικέσθαι , τῇ γοῦν γνώμῃ ἥξειν καὶ βουλομένοις ἔσεσθαι , κίνδυνόν τε τοσόνδε ἀνερρίψαμεν διὰ τῆς ἀλλοτρίας πολλῶν ἡμερῶν ὁδὸν ἰόντες καὶ πᾶν τὸ πρόθυμον παρεχόμενοι ·
and now, if you have aught else in mind, or if you should stand in the way of your own liberty, and that of the rest of the Greeks, it would be a hard case.


4.85.5
3059
ὑμεῖς δὲ εἴ τι ἄλλο ἐν νῷ ἔχετε ἢ εἰ ἐναντιώσεσθε τῇ τε ὑμετέρᾳ αὐτῶν ἐλευθερίᾳ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Ἑλλήνων , δεινὸν ἂν εἴη .
For it is not merely that you oppose me yourselves, but of those also to whom I may apply, each will be less disposed to come over to me, raising a difficulty on the ground that you, to whom I first came, and who are seen in the possession of a considerable city, and are considered to be prudent men, did not admit me.


4.85.6
3060
καὶ γὰρ οὐ μόνον ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἀνθίστασθε , ἀλλὰ καὶ οἷς ἂν ἐπίω , ἧσσόν τις ἐμοὶ πρόσεισι , δυσχερὲς ποιούμενοι εἰ ἐπὶ οὓς πρῶτον ἦλθον ὑμᾶς , καὶ πόλιν ἀξιόχρεων παρεχομένους καὶ ξύνεσιν δοκοῦντας ἔχειν , μὴ ἐδέξασθε ·
And I shall not be able to prove the credibility of the reason [alleged by us for the war], but shall be charged with either bringing to them a liberty which has an unjust end in view, or of having come too weak and powerless to assist them against the Athenians, in case of their attacking them.


4.85.6
3061
καὶ τὴν αἰτίαν οὐχ ἕξω πιστὴν ἀποδεικνύναι , ἀλλ’ ἢ ἄδικον τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἐπιφέρειν ἢ ἀσθενὴς καὶ ἀδύνατος τιμωρῆσαι τὰ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους , ἢν ἐπίωσιν , ἀφῖχθαι .
And yet when I went with the army I now have to the relief of Nisaea, the Athenians, though more numerous, were unwilling to engage with me: so that it is not likely, that coming with forces conveyed by sea, they will send against you an army equal in numbers to that at Nisaea.


4.85.7
3062
καίτοι στρατιᾷ γε τῇδ’ ἣν νῦν ἐγὼ ἔχω ἐπὶ Νίσαιαν ἐμοῦ βοηθήσαντος οὐκ ἠθέλησαν Ἀθηναῖοι πλέονες ὄντες προσμεῖξαι , ὥστε οὐκ εἰκὸς νηίτῃ γε αὐτοὺς τῷ ἐν Νισαίᾳ στρατῷ ἴσον πλῆθος ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἀποστεῖλαι .
With regard to myself, too, I have come to you, not for the injury, but for the liberation of the Greeks-having bound the Lacedaemonian authorities by the most solemn oaths, that such as I win over shall assuredly be independent confederates-nor, again, that we may have allies whom we have got by violence or deceit, but, on the contrary, prepared to act as allies to you, who are enslaved by the Athenians. I claim, therefore, neither to be suspected myself, since I have given the strongest pledges for my honesty, nor to be considered a powerless avenger; and I call on you to come over to me with confidence.


4.86.1
3063
αὐτός τε οὐκ ἐπὶ κακῷ , ἐπ’ ἐλευθερώσει δὲ τῶν Ἑλλήνων παρελήλυθα , ὅρκοις τε Λακεδαιμονίων καταλαβὼν τὰ τέλη τοῖς μεγίστοις ἦ μὴν οὓς ἂν ἔγωγε προσαγάγωμαι ξυμμάχους ἔσεσθαι αὐτονόμους , καὶ ἅμα οὐχ ἵνα ξυμμάχους ὑμᾶς ἔχωμεν ἢ βίᾳ ἢ ἀπάτῃ προσλαβόντες , ἀλλὰ τ- ἐναντίον ὑμῖν δεδουλωμένοις ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων ξυμμαχήσοντες .
"And if any one be backward to do so, from being personally afraid of some individual or other, lest I should put the city into the hands of a particular party, let him above all others feel confidence. For I am not come to be a partisan; nor am I minded to bring you a doubtful liberty, as I should do, if, disregarding your hereditary constitution, I should enslave the many to the few, or the few to the many.


4.86.2
3064
οὔκουν ἀξιῶ οὔτ’ αὐτὸς ὑποπτεύεσθαι , πίστεις γε διδοὺς τὰς μεγίστας , οὐδὲ τιμωρὸς ἀδύνατος νομισθῆναι , προσχωρεῖν τε ὑμᾶς θαρσήσαντας .
For that would be more grievous than foreign dominion;


4.86.3
3065
καὶ εἴ τις ἰδίᾳ τινὰ δεδιὼς ἄρα , μὴ ἐγώ τισι προσθῶ τὴν πόλιν , ἀπρόθυμός ἐστι , πάντων μάλιστα πιστευσάτω .
and towards us Lacedaemonians no obligation would be felt for our exertions, but instead of honour and glory, accusation rather.


4.86.4
3066
οὐ γὰρ ξυστασιάσων ἥκω , οὐδὲ ἂν σαφῆ τὴν ἐλευθερίαν νομίζω ἐπιφέρειν , εἰ τὸ πάτριον παρεὶς τὸ πλέον τοῖς ὀλίγοις ἢ τὸ ἔλασσον τοῖς πᾶσι δουλώσαιμι .
And those charges with which we are throwing down the Athenians, we should ourselves seem to incur in a more odious degree than a party which has shown no pretensions to honesty. For to gain advantage by specious trickery is more disgraceful, at any rate for men in high station, than to do it by open violence:


4.86.5
3067
χαλεπωτέρα γὰρ ἂν τῆς ἀλλοφύλου ἀρχῆς εἴη , καὶ ἡμῖν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις οὐκ ἂν ἀντὶ πόνων χάρις καθίσταιτο , ἀντὶ δὲ τιμῆς καὶ δόξης αἰτία μᾶλλον ·
Since the one is a case of aggression on the plea of might, which fortune has given; the other, by the insidiousness of a dishonest policy. So great care do we take for things which most deeply interest us;


4.86.5
3068
οἷς τε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐγκλήμασι καταπολεμοῦμεν , αὐτοὶ ἂν φαινοίμεθα ἐχθίονα ἢ ὁ μὴ ὑποδείξας ἀρετὴν κατακτώμενοι .
For not only would it be a harder yoke than a foreign rule, but for us Lacedaemonians, instead of gratitude for our pains, there would be blame, instead of honour and glory, reproach;


4.86.6
3069
ἀπάτῃ γὰρ εὐπρεπεῖ αἴσχιον τοῖς γε ἐν ἀξιώματι πλεονεκτῆσαι ἢ βίᾳ ἐμφανεῖ ·
For it is more disgraceful for men in high position to overreach by fraud than by open force;


4.86.6
3070
τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἰσχύος δικαιώσει , ἣν ἡ τύχη ἔδωκεν , ἐπέρχεται , τὸ δὲ γνώμης ἀδίκου ἐπιβουλῇ .
For the one, under the plea of strength which fortune has given, comes with a justification; the other, through the insidiousness of an unfair policy.


4.87.1
3071
οὕτω πολλὴν περιωπὴν τῶν ἡμῖν ἐς τὰ μέγιστα διαφόρων ποιούμεθα , καὶ οὐκ ἂν μείζω πρὸς τοῖς ὅρκοις βεβαίωσιν λάβοιτε ἢ οἷς τὰ ἔργα ἐκ τῶν λόγων ἀναθρούμενα δόκησιν ἀναγκαίαν παρέχεται ὡς καὶ ξυμφέρει ὁμοίως ὡς εἶπον .
" But if, when I advance these arguments, you say that you have not the power to comply with them, and yet claim, on the strength of your kind wishes, to incur no harm by refusing;"


4.87.2
3072
&quot; εἰ δ’ ἐμοῦ ταῦτα προϊσχομένου ἀδύνατοι μὲν φήσετε εἶναι , εὖνοι δ’ ὄντες ἀξιώσετε μὴ κακούμενοι διωθεῖσθαι καὶ τὴν ἐλευθερίαν μὴ ἀκίνδυνον ὑμῖν φαίνεσθαι , δίκαιόν τε εἶναι , οἷς καὶ δυνατὸν δέχεσθαι αὐτήν , τούτοις καὶ ἐπιφέρειν , ἄκοντα δὲ μηδένα προσαναγκάζειν , μάρτυρας μὲν θεοὺς καὶ ἥρως τοὺς ἐγχωρίους ποιήσομαι ὡς ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ ἥκων οὐ πείθω , γῆν δὲ τὴν ὑμετέραν δῃῶν πειράσομαι βιάζεσθαι , καὶ οὐκ ἀδικεῖν ἔτι νομιῶ , προσεῖναι δέ τί μοι καὶ κατὰ δύο ἀνάγκας τὸ εὔλογον , τῶν μὲν Λακεδαιμονίων , ὅπως μὴ τῷ ὑμετέρῳ εὔνῳ , εἰ μὴ προσαχθήσεσθε , τοῖς ἀπὸ ὑμῶν χρήμασι φερομένοις παρ’ Ἀθηναίους βλάπτωνται , οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες ἵνα μὴ κωλύωνται ὑφ’ ὑμῶν δουλείας ἀπαλλαγῆναι .
" and allege that freedom does not appear to you unaccompanied with danger, and that it is right to offer it to those who have the power to accept it, but to force it on no one against his will: in that case, I will take the gods and heroes of your country to witness, that after coming for your benefit, I cannot prevail upon you to accept it; and will endeavour to compel you by ravaging your country. Nor shall I then think that I am doing wrong, but that reason is on my side, on the ground of two compulsory considerations;"


4.87.4
3073
οὐ γὰρ δὴ εἰκότως γ’ ἂν τάδε πράσσοιμεν , οὐδὲ ὀφείλομεν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι μὴ κοινοῦ τινὸς ἀγαθοῦ αἰτίᾳ τοὺς μὴ βουλομένους ἐλευθεροῦν ·
" nor are we Lacedaemonians bound to liberate those who do not wish it, except on the plea of some general good. Nor is it dominion that we aim at;"


4.87.5
3074
οὐδ’ αὖ ἀρχῆς ἐφιέμεθα , παῦσαι δὲ μᾶλλον ἑτέρους σπεύδοντες τοὺς πλείους ἂν ἀδικοῖμεν , εἰ ξύμπασιν αὐτονομίαν ἐπιφέροντες ὑμᾶς τοὺς ἐναντιουμένους περιίδοιμεν .
" but rather being anxious, as we are, to stop others from acquiring it, we should wrong the majority, if, when bringing independence to all, we should permit you to stand in the way of it."


4.87.6
3075
πρὸς ταῦτα βουλεύεσθε εὖ , καὶ ἀγωνίσασθε τοῖς τε Ἕλλησιν ἄρξαι πρῶτοι ἐλευθερίας καὶ ἀίδιον δόξαν καταθέσθαι , καὶ αὐτοὶ τά τε ἴδια μὴ βλαφθῆναι καὶ ξυμπάσῃ τῇ πόλει τὸ κάλλιστον ὄνομα περιθεῖναι &quot; .
" Wherefore advise well, and strive to be the first to give liberty to the Greeks, and to lay up for yourselves everlasting glory; and both to avoid suffering in your private capacities, and to confer on your whole city the most honourable title."


4.88.1
3076
ὁ μὲν Βρασίδας τοσαῦτα εἶπεν .
To this effect spoke Brasidas.

οἱ δὲ Ἀκάνθιοι ,πολλῶν λεχθέντων πρότερον ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα , κρύφα διαψηφισάμενοι , διά τε τὸ ἐπαγωγὰ εἰπεῖν τὸν Βρασίδαν καὶ περὶ τοῦ καρποῦ φόβῳ ἔγνωσαν οἱ πλείους ἀφίστασθαι Ἀθηναίων , καὶ πιστώσαντες αὐτὸν τοῖς ὅρκοις οὓς τὰ τέλη τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ὀμόσαντα αὐτὸν ἐξέπεμψαν , ἦ μὴν ἔσεσθαι ξυμμάχους αὐτονόμους οὓς ἂν προσαγάγηται , οὕτω δέχονται τὸν στρατόν .
The Acanthians, after much previous speaking on both sides of the question, gave their votes upon it in secret; and because Brasidas had urged alluring arguments, and at the same time through fear for their fruit, the majority determined to revolt from the Athenians; and after pledging him to the oaths which the Lacedaemonian authorities swore before they sent him out, that such as he won over should assuredly be independent allies, in this way they admitted the army.


4.88.2
3078
καὶ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον καὶ Στάγιρος Ἀνδρίων ἀποικία ξυναπέστη .
Not long after, Stagirus, a colony of the Andrians, also joined them in revolt.


4.88.2
3079
ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἐν τῷ θέρει τούτῳ ἐγένετο .
Such then were the events of this summer.


4.89.1
3080
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος εὐθὺς ἀρχομένου , ὡς τῷ Ἱπποκράτει καὶ Δημοσθένει στρατηγοῖς οὖσιν Ἀθηναίων τὰ ἐν τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς ἐνεδίδοτο καὶ ἔδει τὸν μὲν Δημοσθένη ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐς τὰς Σίφας ἀπαντῆσαι , τὸν δ’ ἐπὶ τὸ Δήλιον , γενομένης διαμαρτίας τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐς ἃς ἔδει ἀμφοτέρους στρατεύειν , ὁ μὲν Δημοσθένης πρότερον πλεύσας πρὸς τὰς Σίφας καὶ ἔχων ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶν Ἀκαρνᾶνας καὶ τῶν ἐκεῖ πολλοὺς ξυμμάχων , ἄπρακτος γίγνεται μηνυθέντος τοῦ ἐπιβουλεύματος ὑπὸ Νικομάχου ἀνδρὸς Φωκέως ἐκ Φανοτέως , ὃς Λακεδαιμονίοις εἶπεν , ἐκεῖνοι δὲ Βοιωτοῖς ·
At the very commencement of the following winter, when the towns in Boeotia were to be delivered up to Hippocrates and Demosthenes, the Athenian generals, and Demosthenes was to repair with his ships to Siphae, Hippocrates to Delium; a mistake having been made in the days on which they were both to take the field, Demosthenes sailed first to Siphae, with the Acarnanians and many allies from those parts on board, but did not succeed in his undertaking, through information of the design having been given by Nicomachus, a Phocian of Phanoteus, who told the Lacedaemonians, and they the Boeotians.


4.89.2
3081
καὶ βοηθείας γενομένης πάντων Βοιωτῶν ( οὐ γάρ πω Ἱπποκράτης παρελύπει ἐν τῇ γῇ ὤν ) προκαταλαμβάνονται αἵ τε Σῖφαι καὶ ἡ Χαιρώνεια .
Accordingly, succours being brought by all the Boeotians, (for Hippocrates was not yet in their country to make a diversion,) Siphae and Chaeronea were secured by surprise;


4.89.2
3082
ὡς δὲ ᾔσθοντο οἱ πράσσοντες τὸ ἁμάρτημα , οὐδὲν ἐκίνησαν τῶν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν .
And when the conspirators were aware of the mistake, they attempted no movement in the cities.


4.90.1
3083
ὁ δὲ Ἱπποκράτης ἀναστήσας Ἀθηναίους πανδημεί , αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς μετοίκους καὶ ξένων ὅσοι παρῆσαν ὕστερος ἀφικνεῖται ἐπὶ τὸ Δήλιον , ἤδη τῶν Βοιωτῶν ἀνακεχωρηκότων ἀπὸ τῶν Σιφῶν ·
But Hippocrates, having drawn out the whole population of Athens, citizens, resident aliens, and all the foreigners then in the city, afterwards arrived at Delium, when the Boeotians had now returned from Siphae;


4.90.1
3084
καὶ καθίσας τὸν στρατὸν Δήλιον ἐτείχιζε τοιῷδε τρόπῳ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος .
And having encamped his army, proceeded to fortify Delium, the sanctuary of Apollo, in the following manner.


4.90.2
3085
τάφρον μὲν κύκλῳ περὶ τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ τὸν νεὼν ἔσκαπτον , ἐκ δὲ τοῦ ὀρύγματος ἀνέβαλλον ἀντὶ τείχους τὸν χοῦν , καὶ σταυροὺς παρακαταπηγνύντες , ἄμπελον κόπτοντες τὴν περὶ τὸ ἱερὸν ἐσέβαλλον καὶ λίθους ἅμα καὶ πλίνθον ἐκ τῶν οἰκοπέδων τῶν ἐγγὺς καθαιροῦντες , καὶ παντὶ τρόπῳ ἐμετεώριζον τὸ ἔρυμα .
They dug a trench all round the sacred precinct and the fane, and from the ground thus excavated threw up the earth in a mound, as a substitute for a wall;


4.90.2
3086
πύργους τε ξυλίνους κατέστησαν ᾗ καιρὸς ἦν καὶ τοῦ ἱεροῦ οἰκοδόμημα οὐδὲν ὑπῆρχεν ·
And fixing stakes on it, cut down the vines that were round the sanctuary and threw them in, taking down also at the same time stones and brick-work from the neighbouring houses;


4.90.2
3087
ἥπερ γὰρ ἦν στοὰ κατεπεπτώκει .
And so they ran up the work in every way. They also erected wooden towers where there was occasion for them, and where there was not already any building belonging to the temple;


4.90.3
3088
ἡμέρᾳ δὲ ἀρξάμενοι τρίτῃ ὡς οἴκοθεν ὥρμησαν ταύτην τε εἰργάζοντο καὶ τὴν τετάρτην καὶ τῆς πέμπτης μέχρι ἀρίστου .
for [on one side] the gallery that once existed had fallen down. Having begun the work on the third day after setting out from home, they continued it that day, the fourth, and till dinner-time of the fifth.


4.90.4
3089
ἔπειτα , ὡς τὰ πλεῖστα ἀπετετέλεστο , τὸ μὲν στρατόπεδον προαπεχώρησεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Δηλίου οἷον δέκα σταδίους ὡς ἐπ’ οἴκου πορευόμενον , καὶ οἱ μὲν ψιλοὶ οἱ πλεῖστοι εὐθὺς ἐχώρουν , οἱ δ’ ὁπλῖται θέμενοι τὰ ὅπλα ἡσύχαζον ·
Then, as the main part of it was finished, the army went forward from Delium about ten stades on its way home;


4.90.4
3090
Ἱπποκράτης δὲ ὑπομένων ἔτι καθίστατο φυλακάς τε καὶ τὰ περὶ τὸ προτείχισμα , ὅσα ἦν ὑπόλοιπα , ὡς χρῆν ἐπιτελέσαι .
Whence most of the light-armed proceeded straight on, but the heavy-armed halted, and remained stationary; while Hippocrates was still staying behind, and arranging the guards, and how they should complete such parts of the out-works as remained to be finished.


4.91.1
3091
οἱ δὲ Βοιωτοὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις ξυνελέγοντο ἐς τὴν Τάναγραν ·
Now during the days thus employed, the Boeotians were mustering at Tanagra;


4.91.1
3092
καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων παρῆσαν καὶ ᾐσθάνοντο τοὺς Ἀθηναίους προχωροῦντας ἐπ’ οἴκου , τῶν ἄλλων βοιωταρχῶν , οἵ εἰσιν ἕνδεκα , οὐ ξυνεπαινούντων μάχεσθαι , ἐπειδὴ οὐκ ἐν τῇ Βοιωτίᾳ ἔτι εἰσί ( μάλιστα γὰρ ἐν μεθορίοις τῆς Ὠρωπίας οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἦσαν , ὅτε ἔθεντο τὰ ὅπλα ) , Παγώνδας ὁ Αἰολάδου βοιωταρχῶν ἐκ Θηβῶν μετ’ Ἀριανθίδου τοῦ Λυσιμαχίδου καὶ ἡγεμονίας οὔσης αὐτοῦ βουλόμενος τὴν μάχην ποιῆσαι καὶ νομίζων ἄμεινον εἶναι κινδυνεῦσαι , προσκαλῶν ἑκάστους κατὰ λόχους , ὅπως μὴ ἁθρόοι ἐκλίποιεν τὰ ὅπλα , ἔπειθε τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς ἰέναι ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ τὸν ἀγῶνα ποιεῖσθαι , λέγων τοιάδε .
And when they were come from all the cities, and found the Athenians on their progress homeward, the rest of the Boeotarchs, (who were eleven in number,) not consenting to an engagement, since the Athenians were no longer in Boeotia, (for they were just within the borders of the Oropian territory when they halted,) Pagondas son of Aeoladas, being Boeotarch of Thebes together with Arianthidas son of Lysimachidas, and having the command at the time, wished to fight the battle, and thought it best to run the risk; and so, calling the men to him separately, in their different battalions, that they might not all at once leave the arms that were piled, he tried to persuade the Boeotians to march against the Athenians and bring on the contest, by speaking to this effect:


4.92.1
3093
&quot; χρῆν μέν , ὦ ἄνδρες Βοιωτοί , μηδ’ ἐς ἐπίνοιάν τινα ἡμῶν ἐλθεῖν τῶν ἀρχόντων ὡς οὐκ εἰκὸς Ἀθηναίοις , ἢν ἄρα μὴ ἐν τῇ Βοιωτίᾳ ἔτι καταλάβωμεν αὐτούς , διὰ μάχης ἐλθεῖν .
"Men of Boeotia, it should not have even entered the thoughts of any of us your commanders, that it would not be right to engage with the Athenians, in case we found them no longer in Boeotia.


4.92.1
3094
τὴν γὰρ Βοιωτίαν ἐκ τῆς ὁμόρου ἐλθόντες τεῖχος ἐνοικοδομησάμενοι μέλλουσι φθείρειν , καὶ εἰσὶ δήπου πολέμιοι ἐν ᾧ τε ἂν χωρίῳ καταληφθῶσι καὶ ὅθεν ἐπελθόντες πολέμια ἔδρασαν .
For it is Boeotia that they intend to ravage, after coming from the border territory, and building a fortress in it: and so they are surely our enemies, wherever they may be found, and from whatever country they may have come to act as enemies would."


4.92.2
3095
νυνὶ δ’ εἴ τῳ καὶ ἀσφαλέστερον ἔδοξεν εἶναι , μεταγνώτω .
"But now, if any one has thought this the safer course, let him change his mind on the question.


4.92.2
3096
οὐ γὰρ τὸ προμηθές , οἷς ἂν ἄλλος ἐπίῃ , περὶ τῆς σφετέρας ὁμοίως ἐνδέχεται λογισμὸν καὶ ὅστις τὰ μὲν ἑαυτοῦ ἔχει , τοῦ πλέονος δὲ ὀρεγόμενος ἑκών τινι ἐπέρχεται .
For prudence, in the case of men attacked by others, does not admit of such nice calculation as in the case of those who are enjoying their own, and yet wilfully attack others through coveting more. The custom of your country, too, is to repel alike a foreign force that has invaded you, whether in your own or in your neighbour's territory."


4.92.3
3097
πάτριόν τε ὑμῖν στρατὸν ἀλλόφυλον ἐπελθόντα καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκείᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ τῶν πέλας ὁμοίως ἀμύνεσθαι .
"But against Athenians, and borderers besides, this is far more necessary than against any others.


4.92.3
3098
Ἀθηναίους δὲ καὶ προσέτι ὁμόρους ὄντας πολλῷ μάλιστα δεῖ .
For, with respect to their neighbours, equality in the case of all men constitutes liberty;"


4.92.4
3099
πρός τε γὰρ τοὺς ἀστυγείτονας πᾶσι τὸ ἀντίπαλον καὶ ἐλεύθερον καθίσταται , καὶ πρὸς τούτους γε δή , οἳ καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἐγγύς , ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἄπωθεν πειρῶνται δουλοῦσθαι , πῶς οὐ χρὴ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἔσχατον ἀγῶνος ἐλθεῖν ( παράδειγμα δὲ ἔχομεν τούς τε ἀντιπέρας Εὐβοέας καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος τὸ πολὺ ὡς αὐτοῖς διάκειται ) , καὶ γνῶναι ὅτι τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις οἱ πλησιόχωροι περὶ γῆς ὅρων τὰς μάχας ποιοῦνται , ἡμῖν δὲ ἐς πᾶσαν , ἢν νικηθῶμεν , εἷς ὅρος οὐκ ἀντίλεκτος παγήσεται ;
" and against these men, most especially, who endeavour to make vassals not only of those who are near them, but of those also who are far away, how can it fail to be our duty to struggle to the very utmost? (for in the Euboeans across the strait, and in the greater part of the rest of Greece, we have an example of the position in which they stand towards them;) and to be convinced, that with others their neighbours fight about the boundaries of their land, but that in our case there will be fixed for the whole of it, if we are conquered, one boundary, not to be controverted; for they will invade it and take by force whatever we have."


4.92.5
3100
ἐσελθόντες γὰρ βίᾳ τὰ ἡμέτερα ἕξουσιν .
"For, if they enter by force, they will hold our possessions.


4.92.5
3101
τοσούτῳ ἐπικινδυνοτέραν ἑτέρων τὴν παροίκησιν τῶνδε ἔχομεν .
So much more dangerous neighbours have we in these men than in any others.


4.92.5
3102
εἰώθασί τε οἱ ἰσχύος που θράσει τοῖς πέλας , ὥσπερ Ἀθηναῖοι νῦν , ἐπιόντες τὸν μὲν ἡσυχάζοντα καὶ ἐν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ μόνον ἀμυνόμενον ἀδεέστερον ἐπιστρατεύειν , τὸν δὲ ἔξω ὅρων προαπαντῶντα καί , ἢν καιρὸς ᾖ , πολέμου ἄρχοντα ἧσσον ἑτοίμως κατέχειν .
It is usual, also, with such as through confidence in their power attack those who are near them, as the Athenians are now doing, to march more fearlessly against those who remain quiet, and only defend themselves in their own territory; but to be less ready to grapple with those who meet them beyond their borders, and strike the first blow, if they have an opportunity. And we have had a proof of this in the case of these very men;"


4.92.6
3103
πεῖραν δὲ ἔχομεν ἡμεῖς αὐτοῦ ἐς τούσδε ·
"For by conquering them at Coronaea, when they got possession of our country through our own divisions,


4.92.6
3104
νικήσαντες γὰρ ἐν Κορωνείᾳ αὐτούς , ὅτε τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν στασιαζόντων κατέσχον , πολλὴν ἄδειαν τῇ Βοιωτίᾳ μέχρι τοῦδε κατεστήσαμεν .
we won great security for Boeotia, which has lasted up to the present time."


4.92.7
3105
ὧν χρὴ μνησθέντας ἡμᾶς τούς τε πρεσβυτέρους ὁμοιωθῆναι τοῖς πρὶν ἔργοις , τούς τε νεωτέρους πατέρων τῶν τότε ἀγαθῶν γενομένων παῖδας πειρᾶσθαι μὴ αἰσχῦναι τὰς προσηκούσας ἀρετάς , πιστεύσαντας δὲ τῷ θεῷ πρὸς ἡμῶν ἔσεσθαι , οὗ τὸ ἱερὸν ἀνόμως τειχίσαντες νέμονται , καὶ τοῖς ἱεροῖς ἃ ἡμῖν θυσαμένοις καλὰ φαίνεται , ὁμόσε χωρῆσαι τοῖσδε καὶ δεῖξαι ὅτι ὧν μὲν ἐφίενται πρὸς τοὺς μὴ ἀμυνομένους ἐπιόντες κτάσθων , οἷς δὲ γενναῖον τήν τε αὑτῶν αἰεὶ ἐλευθεροῦν μάχῃ καὶ τὴν ἄλλων μὴ δουλοῦσθαι ἀδίκως , ἀνανταγώνιστοι ἀπ’ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀπίασιν &quot; .
" Remembering which, we ought, the older part of us, to come up to our former deeds, and the younger, as sons of fathers who then behaved so bravely, to strive not to disgrace the noble qualities that by birth belong to them; but to trust that the gods will be on our side, whose sanctuary they have lawlessly fortified, and are using, and to rely on the omens, which, after sacrificing, appear favourable to us; and so to meet these men in battle, and show them that what they want they must go and get by attacking such as will not resist them; but that from those who deem it noble ever to secure by their arms the liberty of their own country, and not to enslave unjustly that of other people, they shall not go away without a struggle."


4.93.1
3106
τοιαῦτα ὁ Παγώνδας τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς παραινέσας ἔπεισεν ἰέναι ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους .
By thus exhorting the Boeotians, Pagondas persuaded them to go against the Athenians,


4.93.1
3107
καὶ κατὰ τάχος ἀναστήσας ἦγε τὸν στρατόν ( ἤδη γὰρ καὶ τῆς ἡμέρας ὀψὲ ἦν ) , καὶ ἐπειδὴ προσέμειξεν ἐγγὺς τοῦ στρατεύματος αὐτῶν , ἐς χωρίον καθίσας ὅθεν λόφου ὄντος μεταξὺ οὐκ ἐθεώρουν ἀλλήλους , ἔτασσέ τε καὶ παρεσκευάζετο ὡς ἐς μάχην .
And quickly breaking up his camp, led the army forward (for it was now late in the day). On approaching near to their forces, he placed his troops in a position where, in consequence of a hill intervening, the armies did not see each other;


4.93.2
3108
τῷ δὲ Ἱπποκράτει ὄντι περὶ τὸ Δήλιον ὡς αὐτῷ ἠγγέλθη ὅτι Βοιωτοὶ ἐπέρχονται , πέμπει ἐς τὸ στράτευμα κελεύων ἐς τάξιν καθίστασθαι , καὶ αὐτὸς οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον ἐπῆλθε , καταλιπὼν ὡς τριακοσίους ἱππέας περὶ τὸ Δήλιον , ὅπως φύλακές τε ἅμα εἶεν , εἴ τις ἐπίοι αὐτῷ , καὶ τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς καιρὸν φυλάξαντες ἐπιγένοιντο ἐν τῇ μάχῃ .
and there he drew them up, and made his arrangements for battle. When Hippocrates, who was still at Delium, received tidings of the advance of the Boeotians, he sent to his troops, with orders to throw themselves into line, and himself joined them soon after, leaving three hundred horse at Delium, both to defend it if any one came against it, and to watch their opportunity and fall upon the Boeotians during the engagement.


4.93.3
3109
Βοιωτοὶ δὲ πρὸς τούτους ἀντικατέστησαν τοὺς ἀμυνουμένους , καὶ ἐπειδὴ καλῶς αὐτοῖς εἶχεν , ὑπερεφάνησαν τοῦ λόφου καὶ ἔθεντο τὰ ὅπλα τεταγμένοι ὥσπερ ἔμελλον , ὁπλῖται ἑπτακισχίλιοι μάλιστα καὶ ψιλοὶ ὑπὲρ μυρίους , ἱππῆς δὲ χίλιοι καὶ πελτασταὶ πεντακόσιοι .
Against these the Boeotians posted a division to resist their charge; and when all was well arranged by them, they appeared over the hill, and halted in the order they intended to fight in, to the number of about seven thousand heavy-armed, more than ten thousand light-armed, one thousand horse, and five hundred targeteers.


4.93.4
3110
εἶχον δὲ δεξιὸν μὲν κέρας Θηβαῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμοροι αὐτοῖς ·
The right wing was held by the Thebans and those of the same division of Boeotia;


4.93.4
3111
μέσοι δὲ Ἁλιάρτιοι καὶ Κορωναῖοι καὶ Κωπαιῆς καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι οἱ περὶ τὴν λίμνην ·
The centre by the Haliartians, Coronaeans, Copaeans, and the other people round the lake;


4.93.4
3112
τὸ δὲ εὐώνυμον εἶχον Θεσπιῆς καὶ Ταναγραῖοι καὶ Ὀρχομένιοι .
The left by the Thespians, Tanagraeans, and Orchomenians.


4.93.4
3113
ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ κέρᾳ ἑκατέρῳ οἱ ἱππῆς καὶ ψιλοὶ ἦσαν .
The cavalry and light-armed were posted on each flank.


4.93.4
3114
ἐπ’ ἀσπίδας δὲ πέντε μὲν καὶ εἴκοσι Θηβαῖοι ἐτάξαντο , οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ὡς ἕκαστοι ἔτυχον .
The Thebans formed their line five-and-twenty deep; the rest, as might happen.


4.93.5
3115
αὕτη μὲν Βοιωτῶν παρασκευὴ καὶ διάκοσμος ἦν ·
These then were the forces and the dispositions of the Boeotians.


4.94.1
3116
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ οἱ μὲν ὁπλῖται ἐπὶ ὀκτὼ πᾶν τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐτάξαντο ὄντες πλήθει ἰσοπαλεῖς τοῖς ἐναντίοις , ἱππῆς δὲ ἐφ’ ἑκατέρῳ τῷ κέρᾳ .
On the side of the Athenians, the heavy-armed formed their whole line eight deep, being equal in numbers to their adversaries, with the cavalry on each flank.


4.94.1
3117
ψιλοὶ δὲ ἐκ παρασκευῆς μὲν ὡπλισμένοι οὔτε τότε παρῆσαν οὔτε ἐγένοντο τῇ πόλει ·
As for light-armed regularly equipped, there were neither any present on that occasion, nor had the state ever raised any.


4.94.1
3118
οἵπερ δὲ ξυνεσέβαλον ὄντες πολλαπλάσιοι τῶν ἐναντίων , ἄοπλοί τε πολλοὶ ἠκολούθησαν , ἅτε πανστρατιᾶς ξένων τῶν παρόντων καὶ ἀστῶν γενομένης , καὶ ὡς τὸ πρῶτον ὥρμησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου , οὐ παρεγένοντο ὅτι μὴ ὀλίγοι .
Such as had joined in the invasion, though many times more numerous than those on the other side, had, for the most part, followed unarmed; inasmuch as there was a levy "en masse" of foreigners who were present, as well as of citizens; and on their first setting out for home, they did not, with a few exceptions, keep to their standards.


4.94.2
3119
καθεστώτων δὲ ἐς τὴν τάξιν καὶ ἤδη μελλόντων ξυνιέναι , Ἱπποκράτης ὁ στρατηγὸς ἐπιπαριὼν τὸ στρατόπεδον τῶν Ἀθηναίων παρεκελεύετό τε καὶ ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
When the armies were formed in line, and now on the point of engaging, Hippocrates, the general, passed along the Athenian ranks, and encouraged them, by speaking as follows:


4.95.1
3120
&quot; ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , δι’ ὀλίγου μὲν ἡ παραίνεσις γίγνεται , τὸ ἴσον δὲ πρός γε τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ἄνδρας δύναται καὶ ὑπόμνησιν μᾶλλον ἔχει ἢ ἐπικέλευσιν .
" Athenians, my advice is given you in a few words, but it is equally availing to brave men, and is intended to remind, rather than exhort you."


4.95.2
3121
παραστῇ δὲ μηδενὶ ὑμῶν ὡς ἐν τῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ οὐ προσῆκον τοσόνδε κίνδυνον ἀναρριπτοῦμεν .
"Let the thought then be entertained by none of you, that we are improperly running this hazard in another people's territory.


4.95.2
3122
ἐν γὰρ τῇ τούτων ὑπὲρ τῆς ἡμετέρας ὁ ἀγὼν ἔσται ·
For though in these men's territory, the struggle will be for the good of our own;


4.95.2
3123
καὶ ἢν νικήσωμεν , οὐ μή ποτε ὑμῖν Πελοποννήσιοι ἐς τὴν χώραν ἄνευ τῆς τῶνδε ἵππου ἐσβάλωσιν , ἐν δὲ μιᾷ μάχῃ τήνδε τε προσκτᾶσθε καὶ ἐκείνην μᾶλλον ἐλευθεροῦτε .
And if we conquer, the Peloponnesians will never invade your country, when deprived of the Boeotian horse; but in one battle you will both gain possession of this land, and confirm the liberty of that."


4.95.3
3124
χωρήσατε οὖν ἀξίως ἐς αὐτοὺς τῆς τε πόλεως , ἣν ἕκαστος πατρίδα ἔχων πρώτην ἐν τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἀγάλλεται , καὶ τῶν πατέρων , οἳ τούσδε μάχῃ κρατοῦντες μετὰ Μυρωνίδου ἐν Οἰνοφύτοις τὴν Βοιωτίαν ποτὲ ἔσχον &quot; .
" Advance to meet them, then, in a manner worthy of the state in which each of you boasts that he has the first country in Greece; and of your fathers, who, by defeating these men in battle at Aenophyta, under Myronides, once got possession of Boeotia."


4.96.1
3125
τοιαῦτα τοῦ Ἱπποκράτους παρακελευομένου καὶ μέχρι μὲν μέσου τοῦ στρατοπέδου ἐπελθόντος , τὸ δὲ πλέον οὐκέτι φθάσαντος , οἱ Βοιωτοί , παρακελευσαμένου καὶ σφίσιν ὡς διὰ ταχέων καὶ ἐνταῦθα Παγώνδου , παιανίσαντες ἐπῇσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λόφου .
While Hippocrates was thus exhorting his men, and when he had reached the centre of the line, but had not had time to go farther, the Boeotians, having also been exhorted in few words by Pagondas, on that occasion as well as the former, raised their paean, and advanced against them from the hill.


4.96.1
3126
ἀντεπῇσαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ προσέμειξαν δρόμῳ .
The Athenians, on their side, also advanced to meet them, and closed with them at a run.


4.96.2
3127
καὶ ἑκατέρων τῶν στρατοπέδων τὰ ἔσχατα οὐκ ἦλθεν ἐς χεῖρας , ἀλλὰ τὸ αὐτὸ ἔπαθεν ·
The extremity of neither line came into action, but both were in the same case;


4.96.2
3128
ῥύακες γὰρ ἐκώλυσαν .
For water-courses were in their way:


4.96.2
3129
τὸ δὲ ἄλλο καρτερᾷ μάχῃ καὶ ὠθισμῷ ἀσπίδων ξυνειστήκει .
But the rest met in an obstinate engagement, shield to shield.


4.96.3
3130
καὶ τὸ μὲν εὐώνυμον τῶν Βοιωτῶν καὶ μέχρι μέσου ἡσσᾶτο ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καὶ ἐπίεσαν τούς τε ἄλλους ταύτῃ καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα τοὺς Θεσπιᾶς .
And the Boeotian left, and as far as the centre, was beaten by the Athenians, who pressed hard both the others posted there, and especially the Thespians.


4.96.3
3131
ὑποχωρησάντων γὰρ αὐτοῖς τῶν παρατεταγμένων , καὶ κυκλωθέντων ἐν ὀλίγῳ , οἵπερ διεφθάρησαν Θεσπιῶν , ἐν χερσὶν ἀμυνόμενοι κατεκόπησαν ·
For the troops next to them in the line having given way, and the Thespians being thus surrounded in a narrow space, those of them who were killed were cut down while defending themselves hand to hand;


4.96.3
3132
καί τινες καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων διὰ τὴν κύκλωσιν ταραχθέντες ἠγνόησάν τε καὶ ἀπέκτειναν ἀλλήλους .
But some of the Athenians, through being surrounded, were in confusion, and killed each other without knowing it.


4.96.4
3133
τὸ μὲν οὖν ταύτῃ ἡσσᾶτο τῶν Βοιωτῶν καὶ πρὸς τὸ μαχόμενον κατέφυγε , τὸ δὲ δεξιόν , ᾗ οἱ Θηβαῖοι ἦσαν , ἐκράτει τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καὶ ὠσάμενοι κατὰ βραχὺ τὸ πρῶτον ἐπηκολούθουν .
and some of the Athenians also, being thrown into confusion through surrounding the enemy, failed to recognise their own men, and so killed each other. This part then of the Boeotian line was beaten, and retreated on that which was still fighting;


4.96.5
3134
καὶ ξυνέβη , Παγώνδου περιπέμψαντος δύο τέλη τῶν ἱππέων ἐκ τοῦ ἀφανοῦς περὶ τὸν λόφον , ὡς ἐπόνει τὸ εὐώνυμον αὐτῶν , καὶ ὑπερφανέντων αἰφνιδίως , τὸ νικῶν τῶν Ἀθηναίων κέρας , νομίσαν ἄλλο στράτευμα ἐπιέναι , ἐς φόβον καταστῆναι ·
but their right, where the Thebans were posted, had the advantage over the Athenians, and drove them back, and pursued them, though but gradually at first. It happened also, that Pagondas having secretly sent two squadrons of horse round the hill when his left was distressed, and these suddenly making their appearance, the victorious wing of the Athenians, thinking that another army was coming against them, was seized with a panic;


4.96.6
3135
καὶ ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἤδη , ὑπό τε τοῦ τοιούτου καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν Θηβαίων ἐφεπομένων καὶ παραρρηγνύντων , φυγὴ καθειστήκει παντὸς τοῦ στρατοῦ τῶν Ἀθηναίων .
and so now on both parts of the field, owing to this supposition, and to the Thebans' pursuing them and breaking their line, the whole Athenian army took to flight.


4.96.7
3136
καὶ οἱ μὲν πρὸς τὸ Δήλιόν τε καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ὥρμησαν , οἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ Ὠρωποῦ , ἄλλοι δὲ πρὸς Πάρνηθα τὸ ὄρος , οἱ δὲ ὡς ἕκαστοί τινα εἶχον ἐλπίδα σωτηρίας .
Some hurried to Delium and the sea-coast, others towards Oropus, others to Mount Parnes, and others as they severally had hope of saving themselves.


4.96.8
3137
Βοιωτοὶ δὲ ἐφεπόμενοι ἔκτεινον , καὶ μάλιστα οἱ ἱππῆς οἵ τε αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ Λοκροὶ βεβοηθηκότες ἄρτι τῆς τροπῆς γιγνομένης ·
The Boeotians, in the mean time, were pursuing them close, and putting them to the sword, especially the cavalry, both their own and the Locrian, which came to their succour just as the rout took place;


4.96.8
3138
νυκτὸς δὲ ἐπιλαβούσης τὸ ἔργον ῥᾷον τὸ πλῆθος τῶν φευγόντων διεσώθη .
But the mass of the fugitives escaped more easily than they would else have done, in consequence of night coming on before the business was over.


4.96.9
3139
καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ οἵ τε ἐκ τοῦ Ὠρωποῦ καὶ οἱ ἐκ τοῦ Δηλίου φυλακὴν ἐγκαταλιπόντες ( εἶχον γὰρ αὐτὸ ὅμως ἔτι ) ἀπεκομίσθησαν κατὰ θάλασσαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The next day, the troops at Oropus and those at Delium, having left a garrison in it, (for they still continued to hold it notwithstanding,) returned home by sea.


4.97.1
3140
καὶ οἱ Βοιωτοὶ τροπαῖον στήσαντες καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν ἀνελόμενοι νεκροὺς τούς τε τῶν πολεμίων σκυλεύσαντες καὶ φυλακὴν καταλιπόντες ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν Τάναγραν , καὶ τῷ Δηλίῳ ἐπεβούλευον ὡς προσβαλοῦντες .
The Boeotians, after erecting a trophy, taking up their own dead, stripping those of the enemy, and leaving a guard over them, retired to Tanagra, and formed plans for assaulting Delium.


4.97.2
3141
ἐκ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων κῆρυξ πορευόμενος ἐπὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ἀπαντᾷ κήρυκι Βοιωτῷ , ὃς αὐτὸν ἀποστρέψας καὶ εἰπὼν ὅτι οὐδὲν πράξει πρὶν ἂν αὐτὸς ἀναχωρήσῃ πάλιν , καταστὰς ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἔλεγε τὰ παρὰ τῶν Βοιωτῶν , ὅτι οὐ δικαίως δράσειαν παραβαίνοντες τὰ νόμιμα τῶν Ἑλλήνων ·
Meanwhile, a herald from the Athenians, coming to ask back the dead, met a Boeotian herald, who turned him back, and told him that he would gain nothing before he himself had come back again. Then he went to the Athenians, and delivered the message of the Boeotians, viz. " that they had not acted right in violating the laws of the Greeks. For it was a principle acknowledged by all, that in an invasion of each other's territory, they should abstain from injuring the temples that were in it."


4.97.3
3142
πᾶσι γὰρ εἶναι καθεστηκὸς ἰόντας ἐπὶ τὴν ἀλλήλων ἱερῶν τῶν ἐνόντων ἀπέχεσθαι , Ἀθηναίους δὲ Δήλιον τειχίσαντας ἐνοικεῖν , καὶ ὅσα ἄνθρωποι ἐν βεβήλῳ δρῶσι πάντα γίγνεσθαι αὐτόθι , ὕδωρ τε ὃ ἦν ἄψαυστον σφίσι πλὴν πρὸς τὰ ἱερὰ χέρνιβι χρῆσθαι , ἀνασπάσαντας ὑδρεύεσθαι ·
" But the Athenians had fortified Delium, and were living in it, every thing that men do in profane ground being done there; and they drew and used for ordinary purposes the water which was never touched by themselves, except to use in the laver of purification."


4.97.4
3143
ὥστε ὑπέρ τε τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἑαυτῶν Βοιωτούς , ἐπικαλουμένους τοὺς ὁμωχέτας δαίμονας καὶ τὸν Ἀπόλλω , προαγορεύειν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἀπιόντας ἀποφέρεσθαι τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν .
" In the god's behalf, therefore, as well as their own, the Boeotians appealed to the associated deities and to Apollo, and charged them to retire from the sanctuary, and then take back the dead which belonged to them."


4.98.1
3144
τοσαῦτα τοῦ κήρυκος εἰπόντος οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι πέμψαντες παρὰ τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς ἑαυτῶν κήρυκα τοῦ μὲν ἱεροῦ οὔτε ἀδικῆσαι ἔφασαν οὐδὲν οὔτε τοῦ λοιποῦ ἑκόντες βλάψειν ·
The herald having spoken to this effect, the Athenians sent their own herald to the Boeotians, and said, that as for the sanctuary, they had neither done it any injury, nor would they in future voluntarily damage it;


4.98.1
3145
οὐδὲ γὰρ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐσελθεῖν ἐπὶ τούτῳ , ἀλλ’ ἵνα ἐξ αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας μᾶλλον σφᾶς ἀμύνωνται .
For neither had they originally entered it for that purpose, but to avenge themselves from it on those who were rather injuring them.


4.98.2
3146
τὸν δὲ νόμον τοῖς Ἕλλησιν εἶναι , ὧν ἂν ᾖ τὸ κράτος τῆς γῆς ἑκάστης ἤν τε πλέονος ἤν τε βραχυτέρας , τούτων καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ αἰεὶ γίγνεσθαι , τρόποις θεραπευόμενα οἷς ἂν πρὸς τοῖς εἰωθόσι καὶ δύνωνται .
Now the law of the Greeks was, that whoever in any case had command of the country, whether more or less extensive, to them the temples always belonged, provided they received such honours as the occupiers had the power to pay, without limiting them to what were usual.


4.98.3
3147
καὶ γὰρ Βοιωτοὺς καὶ τοὺς πολλοὺς τῶν ἄλλων , ὅσοι ἐξαναστήσαντές τινα βίᾳ νέμονται γῆν , ἀλλοτρίοις ἱεροῖς τὸ πρῶτον ἐπελθόντας οἰκεῖα νῦν κεκτῆσθαι .
For the Boeotians, and most others who had expelled any people from their country and taken forcible possession of it, had proceeded against temples which originally belonged to others, and now held them as their own. And if the Athenians had been able to make themselves masters of the Boeotian territory to a greater extent, such would have been the case:


4.98.4
3148
καὶ αὐτοί , εἰ μὲν ἐπὶ πλέον δυνηθῆναι τῆς ἐκείνων κρατῆσαι , τοῦτ’ ἂν ἔχειν ·
But as it was, from the part in which they then were they would not, if they could help it, retire;


4.98.4
3149
νῦν δὲ ἐν ᾧ μέρει εἰσίν , ἑκόντες εἶναι ὡς ἐκ σφετέρου οὐκ ἀπιέναι .
As they considered that it belonged to them.


4.98.5
3150
ὕδωρ τε ἐν τῇ ἀνάγκῃ κινῆσαι , ἣν οὐκ αὐτοὶ ὕβρει προσθέσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἐκείνους προτέρους ἐπὶ τὴν σφετέραν ἐλθόντας ἀμυνόμενοι βιάζεσθαι χρῆσθαι .
The water they had disturbed under the pressure of necessity, which they had not wantonly brought on themselves; but they were compelled to use it while defending themselves against the Boeotians, who had first come against their country.


4.98.6
3151
πᾶν δ’ εἰκὸς εἶναι τὸ πολέμῳ καὶ δεινῷ τινὶ κατειργόμενον ξύγγνωμόν τι γίγνεσθαι καὶ πρὸς τοῦ θεοῦ .
And every thing, it was natural to suppose, done under pressure of war, or any other danger, would be considered as pardonable even in the eyes of the god.


4.98.6
3152
καὶ γὰρ τῶν ἀκουσίων ἁμαρτημάτων καταφυγὴν εἶναι τοὺς βωμούς , παρανομίαν τε ἐπὶ τοῖς μὴ ἀνάγκῃ κακοῖς ὀνομασθῆναι καὶ οὐκ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ξυμφορῶν τι τολμήσασιν .
For the altars were a place of refuge in unintentional offences; and transgression was a term applied to those who were wicked through no compulsion, and not to those who had ventured to do any thing in consequence of their misfortunes.


4.98.7
3153
τούς τε νεκροὺς πολὺ μειζόνως ἐκείνους ἀντὶ ἱερῶν ἀξιοῦντας ἀποδιδόναι ἀσεβεῖν ἢ τοὺς μὴ ἐθέλοντας ἱεροῖς τὰ πρέποντα κομίζεσθαι .
Nay, the Boeotians were much more impious in wishing to give back dead bodies in return for sanctuaries, than they were who would not at the price of sanctuaries recover things not suitable [for such bartering].


4.98.8
3154
σαφῶς τε ἐκέλευον σφίσιν εἰπεῖν μὴ ἀπιοῦσιν ἐκ τῆς Βοιωτῶν γῆς ( οὐ γὰρ ἐν τῇ ἐκείνων ἔτι εἶναι , ἐν ᾗ δὲ δορὶ ἐκτήσαντο ) , ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὰ πάτρια τοὺς νεκροὺς σπένδουσιν ἀναιρεῖσθαι .
They begged, then, that they would simply tell them to take up their dead, not " after evacuating the territory of the Boeotians" —for they were no longer in their territory, but in one which they had won with their arms—but, " on making a truce according to the custom of their fathers."


4.99.1
3155
οἱ δὲ Βοιωτοὶ ἀπεκρίναντο , εἰ μὲν ἐν τῇ Βοιωτίᾳ εἰσίν , ἀπιόντας ἐκ τῆς ἑαυτῶν ἀποφέρεσθαι τὰ σφέτερα , εἰ δὲ ἐν τῇ ἐκείνων , αὐτοὺς γιγνώσκειν τὸ ποιητέον , νομίζοντες , τὴν μὲν Ὠρωπίαν , ἐν ᾗ τοὺς νεκροὺς ἐν μεθορίοις τῆς μάχης γενομένης κεῖσθαι ξυνέβη , Ἀθηναίων κατὰ τὸ ὑπήκοον εἶναι , καὶ οὐκ ἂν αὐτοὺς βίᾳ σφῶν κρατῆσαι αὐτῶν ·
The Boeotians replied, that "if they were in Boeotia, they might take up their dead after evacuating the country. But if in Athenian territory, then they knew themselves what to do:" Considering that the Oropian territory, in which the bodies happened to be lying, (for the battle was fought on the borders,) was indeed subject to Athens, and yet that the Athenians could not get possession of them without their consent.


4.99.1
3156
οὐδ’ αὖ ἐσπένδοντο δῆθεν ὑπὲρ τῆς ἐκείνων ·
Nor, again, were they disposed, they said, to grant any truce for a country belonging to Athens;


4.99.1
3157
τὸ δὲ &quot; ἐκ τῆς ἑαυτῶν’ εὐπρεπὲς εἶναι ἀποκρίνασθαι &quot; ἀπιόντας καὶ ἀπολαβεῖν ἃ ἀπαιτοῦσιν &quot; .
but they thought it was a fair answer to give, that "when they had evacuated the Boeotian territory, they might then recover what they asked."


4.99.1
3158
ὁ δὲ κῆρυξ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀκούσας ἀπῆλθεν ἄπρακτος .
So the herald of the Athenians, after hearing their answer, returned without effecting his object.


4.100.1
3159
καὶ οἱ Βοιωτοὶ εὐθὺς μεταπεμψάμενοι ἔκ τε τοῦ Μηλιῶς κόλπου ἀκοντιστὰς καὶ σφενδονήτας , καὶ βεβοηθηκότων αὐτοῖς μετὰ τὴν μάχην Κορινθίων τε δισχιλίων ὁπλιτῶν καὶ τῶν ἐκ Νισαίας ἐξεληλυθότων Πελοποννησίων φρουρῶν καὶ Μεγαρέων ἅμα , ἐστράτευσαν ἐπὶ τὸ Δήλιον καὶ προσέβαλον τῷ τειχίσματι , ἄλλῳ τε τρόπῳ πειράσαντες καὶ μηχανὴν προσήγαγον , ἥπερ εἷλεν αὐτό , τοιάνδε .
The Boeotians immediately sent for dartmen and slingers from the Malian gulf, and having been reinforced since the battle by two thousand Corinthian heavy-armed, and the Peloponnesian garrison which had evacuated Nisaea, and some Megareans with them, they marched against Delium and assaulted the fortress, both attempting it in other ways, and bringing against it an engine of the following description, which was the means of taking it.


4.100.2
3160
κεραίαν μεγάλην δίχα πρίσαντες ἐκοίλαναν ἅπασαν καὶ ξυνήρμοσαν πάλιν ἀκριβῶς ὥσπερ αὐλόν , καὶ ἐπ’ ἄκραν λέβητά τε ἤρτησαν ἁλύσεσι καὶ ἀκροφύσιον ἀπὸ τῆς κεραίας σιδηροῦν ἐς αὐτὸν νεῦον καθεῖτο , καὶ ἐσεσιδήρωτο ἐπὶ μέγα καὶ τοῦ ἄλλου ξύλου .
Having sawn a great beam in two, they hollowed out the whole of it, and fitted it nicely together again, like a pipe, and hung by chains at the end of it a caldron, into which was placed an iron bellows-pipe, inclining from the beam, the timber also being for a considerable distance covered with iron.


4.100.3
3161
προσῆγον δὲ ἐκ πολλοῦ ἁμάξαις τῷ τείχει , ᾗ μάλιστα τῇ ἀμπέλῳ καὶ τοῖς ξύλοις ᾠκοδόμητο ·
This they brought up from a distance on carts to that part of the wall where it had been chiefly built of the vines and timber;


4.100.3
3162
καὶ ὁπότε εἴη ἐγγύς , φύσας μεγάλας ἐσθέντες ἐς τὸ πρὸς ἑαυτῶν ἄκρον τῆς κεραίας ἐφύσων .
And when it was near, they applied great bellows to the end of the beam next themselves, and blew them.


4.100.4
3163
ἡ δὲ πνοὴ ἰοῦσα στεγανῶς ἐς τὸν λέβητα , ἔχοντα ἄνθρακάς τε ἡμμένους καὶ θεῖον καὶ πίσσαν , φλόγα ἐποίει μεγάλην καὶ ἧψε τοῦ τείχους , ὥστε μηδένα ἔτι ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ μεῖναι , ἀλλὰ ἀπολιπόντας ἐς φυγὴν καταστῆναι καὶ τὸ τείχισμα τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἁλῶναι .
The blast passing closely confined into the caldron, which held lighted coals, sulphur, and pitch, produced a great flame, and set fire to a part of the wall; so that no one could any longer stand upon it, but they left it and took to flight; and in this way the fortress was taken.


4.100.5
3164
τῶν δὲ φρουρῶν οἱ μὲν ἀπέθανον , διακόσιοι δὲ ἐλήφθησαν ·
Of the garrison some were killed, and two hundred taken;


4.100.5
3165
τῶν δὲ ἄλλων τὸ πλῆθος ἐς τὰς ναῦς ἐσβὰν ἀπεκομίσθη ἐπ’ οἴκου .
Of the rest the greater part got on board their ships, and returned home.


4.101.1
3166
τοῦ δὲ Δηλίου ἑπτακαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ληφθέντος μετὰ τὴν μάχην καὶ τοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων κήρυκος οὐδὲν ἐπισταμένου τῶν γεγενημένων ἐλθόντος οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον αὖθις περὶ τῶν νεκρῶν , ἀπέδοσαν οἱ Βοιωτοὶ καὶ οὐκέτι τ- αὐτὰ ἀπεκρίναντο .
Delium having thus been taken on the fifteenth day after the battle, and the Athenian herald, without knowing any thing that had happened, having soon after come again respecting the bodies, the Boeotians restored them, and no longer made the same answer as before.


4.101.2
3167
ἀπέθανον δὲ Βοιωτῶν μὲν ἐν τῇ μάχῃ ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους πεντακοσίων , Ἀθηναίων δὲ ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους χιλίων καὶ Ἱπποκράτης ὁ στρατηγός , ψιλῶν δὲ καὶ σκευοφόρων πολὺς ἀριθμός .
There fell in the engagement, of the Boeotians, not quite five hundred; of the Athenians, not quite a thousand, and Hippocrates the general; but of light-armed and camp-followers a great number.


4.101.3
3168
μετὰ δὲ τὴν μάχην ταύτην καὶ ὁ Δημοσθένης ὀλίγῳ ὕστερον , ὡς αὐτῷ τότε πλεύσαντι τὰ περὶ τὰς Σίφας τῆς προδοσίας πέρι οὐ προυχώρησεν , ἔχων τὸν στρατὸν ἐπὶ τῶν νεῶν τῶν τε Ἀκαρνάνων καὶ Ἀγραίων καὶ Ἀθηναίων τετρακοσίους ὁπλίτας , ἀπόβασιν ἐποιήσατο ἐς τὴν Σικυωνίαν .
A short time after this battle, Demosthenes, having had no success with regard to Siphae being betrayed to him, when he sailed thither at that time, and having still on board his ships the Acarnanian and Agraean forces, with four hundred Athenian heavy-armed, made a descent on the territory of


4.101.4
3169
καὶ πρὶν πάσας τὰς ναῦς καταπλεῦσαι βοηθήσαντες οἱ Σικυώνιοι τοὺς ἀποβεβηκότας ἔτρεψαν καὶ κατεδίωξαν ἐς τὰς ναῦς , καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτειναν , τοὺς δὲ ζῶντας ἔλαβον .
But before all his ships reached the shore, the Sicyonians came against them, and routed those that had landed, and drove them back to their vessels, killing some, and taking others prisoners.


4.101.4
3170
τροπαῖον δὲ στήσαντες τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν .
Having erected a trophy, they restored the dead under truce.


4.101.5
3171
ἀπέθανε δὲ καὶ Σιτάλκης Ὀδρυσῶν βασιλεὺς ὑπὸ τὰς αὐτὰς ἡμέρας τοῖς ἐπὶ Δηλίῳ , στρατεύσας ἐπὶ Τριβαλλοὺς καὶ νικηθεὶς μάχῃ .
It was also about the same time as the affair at Delium, that Sitalces, king of the Odrysse, died, after making an expedition against the Triballi, and being defeated in battle;


4.101.5
3172
Σεύθης δὲ ὁ Σπαραδόκου ἀδελφιδοῦς ὢν αὐτοῦ ἐβασίλευσεν Ὀδρυσῶν τε καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Θρᾴκης ἧσπερ καὶ ἐκεῖνος .
And Seuthes son of Sparadocus, his nephew, succeeded to the kingdom of the Odrysae, and the other parts of Thrace, over which Sitalces had reigned.


4.102.1
3173
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος Βρασίδας ἔχων τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ξυμμάχους ἐστράτευσεν ἐς Ἀμφίπολιν τὴν ἐπὶ Στρυμόνι ποταμῷ Ἀθηναίων ἀποικίαν .
The same winter, Brasidas with his allies Thrace-ward marched against Amphipolis, the Athenian colony on the river Strymon.


4.102.2
3174
τὸ δὲ χωρίον τοῦτο ἐφ’ οὗ νῦν ἡ πόλις ἐστὶν ἐπείρασε μὲν πρότερον καὶ Ἀρισταγόρας ὁ Μιλήσιος φεύγων βασιλέα Δαρεῖον κατοικίσαι , ἀλλὰ ὑπὸ Ἠδώνων ἐξεκρούσθη , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔτεσι δύο καὶ τριάκοντα ὕστερον , ἐποίκους μυρίους σφῶν τε αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τὸν βουλόμενον πέμψαντες , οἳ διεφθάρησαν ἐν Δραβήσκῳ ὑπὸ Θρᾳκῶν .
On the site on which the town now stands a settlement was before attempted by Aristagoras the Milesian, when flying from king Darius; but he was driven away by the Edonians: and then by the Athenians, two-and-thirty years later, who sent ten thousand settlers of their own citizens, and whoever else would go; who were cut off by the Thracians at Drabescus.


4.102.3
3175
καὶ αὖθις ἑνὸς δέοντι τριακοστῷ ἔτει ἐλθόντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , Ἅγνωνος τοῦ Νικίου οἰκιστοῦ ἐκπεμφθέντος , Ἠδῶνας ἐξελάσαντες ἔκτισαν τὸ χωρίον τοῦτο , ὅπερ πρότερον Ἐννέα ὁδοὶ ἐκαλοῦντο .
Twenty-nine years after, the Athenians went again, Hagnon son of Nicias being sent out as leader of the colony, and expelled the Edonians, and founded a town on the spot which before was called "Nineways."


4.102.3
3176
ὡρμῶντο δὲ ἐκ τῆς Ἠιόνος , ἣν αὐτοὶ εἶχον ἐμπόριον ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἐπιθαλάσσιον , πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι σταδίους ἀπέχον ἀπὸ τῆς νῦν πόλεως , ἣν Ἀμφίπολιν Ἅγνων ὠνόμασεν , ὅτι ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα περιρρέοντος τοῦ Στρυμόνος διὰ τὸ περιέχειν αὐτὴν τείχει μακρῷ ἀπολαβὼν ἐκ ποταμοῦ ἐς ποταμὸν περιφανῆ ἐς θάλασσάν τε καὶ τὴν ἤπειρον ᾤκισεν .
They set out for the purpose from Eion, which they occupied themselves at the mouth of the river, on the coast, at a distance of five-and-twenty stades from the present town, which Hagnon named Amphipolis, because, as the river Strymon flows round it on both sides, with a view to enclosing it, he ran a long wall across from river to river, and built the town so as to be conspicuous both towards the sea and towards the land.


4.103.1
3177
ἐπὶ ταύτην οὖν ὁ Βρασίδας ἄρας ἐξ Ἀρνῶν τῆς Χαλκιδικῆς ἐπορεύετο τῷ στρατῷ .
Against this town then Brasidas marched with his forces, starting from Arnae in Chalcidice.


4.103.1
3178
καὶ ἀφικόμενος περὶ δείλην ἐπὶ τὸν Αὐλῶνα καὶ Βορμίσκον , ᾗ ἡ Βόλβη λίμνη ἐξίησιν ἐς θάλασσαν , καὶ δειπνοποιησάμενος ἐχώρει τὴν νύκτα .
Having arrived about dusk at Aulon and Bromiscus, where the lake Bolbe empties itself into the sea, and there supped, he proceeded during the night.


4.103.2
3179
χειμὼν δὲ ἦν καὶ ὑπένειφεν ·
The weather was stormy, and it was snowing a little;


4.103.2
3180
ᾗ καὶ μᾶλλον ὥρμησε , βουλόμενος λαθεῖν τοὺς ἐν τῇ Ἀμφιπόλει πλὴν τῶν προδιδόντων .
On which account he hurried all the more, wishing to surprise the people of Amphipolis, except those who were to betray it.


4.103.3
3181
ἦσαν γὰρ Ἀργιλίων τε ἐν αὐτῇ οἰκήτορες ( εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ Ἀργίλιοι Ἀνδρίων ἄποικοι ) καὶ ἄλλοι οἳ ξυνέπρασσον ταῦτα , οἱ μὲν Περδίκκᾳ πειθόμενοι , οἱ δὲ Χαλκιδεῦσιν .
For there were residing in it some Argilians, (this people are a colony from Andros,) and some others, who were carrying on this intrigue together; some at the suggestion of Perdiccas, others at that of the Chalcidians.


4.103.4
3182
μάλιστα δὲ οἱ Ἀργίλιοι , ἐγγύς τε προσοικοῦντες καὶ αἰεί ποτε τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ὄντες ὕποπτοι καὶ ἐπιβουλεύοντες τῷ χωρίῳ , ἐπειδὴ παρέτυχεν ὁ καιρὸς καὶ Βρασίδας ἦλθεν , ἔπραξάν τε ἐκ πλέονος πρὸς τοὺς ἐμπολιτεύοντας σφῶν ἐκεῖ ὅπως ἐνδοθήσεται ἡ πόλις , καὶ τότε δεξάμενοι αὐτὸν τῇ πόλει καὶ ἀποστάντες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐκείνῃ τῇ νυκτὶ κατέστησαν τὸν στρατὸν πρὸ ἕω ἐπὶ τὴν γέφυραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ .
But most active of all were the Argilians, who lived close by, and had always been suspected by the Athenians of forming designs upon the place. For when the opportunity now presented itself, and Brasidas had come; as they had for some time past been intriguing with their countrymen who resided there with a view to its being delivered up to him, so at that time they received him into their own town, and revolted from Athens, and took him forward that same night to the bridge over the river.


4.103.5
3183
ἀπέχει δὲ τὸ πόλισμα πλέον τῆς διαβάσεως , καὶ οὐ καθεῖτο τείχη ὥσπερ νῦν , φυλακὴ δέ τις βραχεῖα καθειστήκει ·
The town stands further off than the passage of the river, and the walls did not reach down to it as they do now, but there was only a small guard posted there;


4.103.5
3184
ἣν βιασάμενος ῥᾳδίως ὁ Βρασίδας , ἅμα μὲν τῆς προδοσίας οὔσης , ἅμα δὲ καὶ χειμῶνος ὄντος καὶ ἀπροσδοκήτοις προσπεσών , διέβη τὴν γέφυραν , καὶ τὰ ἔξω τῶν Ἀμφιπολιτῶν οἰκούντων κατὰ πᾶν τὸ χωρίον εὐθὺς εἶχεν .
Which Brasidas easily drove in, (partly from there being treason amongst them, and partly from the stormy weather and the suddenness of his attack,) and then crossed the bridge, and was at once master of all the property outside the town belonging to the Amphipolitans, who had houses over the whole quarter.


4.104.1
3185
τῆς δὲ διαβάσεως αὐτοῦ ἄφνω τοῖς ἐν τῇ πόλει γεγενημένης , καὶ τῶν ἔξω πολλῶν μὲν ἁλισκομένων , τῶν δὲ καὶ καταφευγόντων ἐς τὸ τεῖχος , οἱ Ἀμφιπολῖται ἐς θόρυβον μέγαν κατέστησαν , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἀλλήλοις ὕποπτοι ὄντες .
His passage having thus taken by surprise those who were in the city, while of those who were outside many were made prisoners, and others took refuge within the wall, the Amphipolitans were thrown into great confusion, especially as they were suspected by each other.


4.104.2
3186
καὶ λέγεται Βρασίδαν , εἰ ἠθέλησε μὴ ἐφ’ ἁρπαγὴν τῷ στρατῷ τραπέσθαι , ἀλλ’ εὐθὺς χωρῆσαι πρὸς τὴν πόλιν , δοκεῖν ἂν ἑλεῖν .
Indeed it is said, that if Brasidas would not have set his troops to plunder, but marched straightway to the town, he would probably have taken it.


4.104.3
3187
νῦν δὲ ὁ μὲν ἱδρύσας τὸν στρατόν , ἐπεὶ τὰ ἔξω ἐπέδραμε καὶ οὐδὲν αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔνδον ὡς προσεδέχετο ἀπέβαινεν , ἡσύχαζεν ·
But as it was, after establishing his army there, he overran the property outside; and when he found no result produced by those within, as he expected, he remained quiet.


4.104.4
3188
οἱ δὲ ἐναντίοι τοῖς προδιδοῦσι , κρατοῦντες τῷ πλήθει ὥστε μὴ αὐτίκα τὰς πύλας ἀνοίγεσθαι , πέμπουσι μετὰ Εὐκλέους τοῦ στρατηγοῦ , ὃς ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν παρῆν αὐτοῖς φύλαξ τοῦ χωρίου , ἐπὶ τὸν ἕτερον στρατηγὸν τῶν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης , Θουκυδίδην τὸν Ὀλόρου , ὃς τάδε ξυνέγραψεν , ὄντα περὶ Θάσον ( ἔστι δὲ ἡ νῆσος Παρίων ἀποικία , ἀπέχουσα τῆς Ἀμφιπόλεως ἡμίσεος ἡμέρας μάλιστα πλοῦν ) , κελεύοντες σφίσι βοηθεῖν .
In the mean time, the party opposed to the traitors, prevailing by their numbers to prevent the gates being immediately thrown open, sent with Eucles the general, who had come to them from Athens to defend the place, to the other commander Thrace-ward, Thucydides son of Olorus, the historian of this war, who was at Thasos, (this island is a colony of the Parians, distant from Amphipolis about half a day's sail,) requesting him to come to their relief.


4.104.5

καὶ ὁ μὲν ἀκούσας κατὰ τάχος ἑπτὰ ναυσὶν αἳ ἔτυχον παροῦσαι ἔπλει , καὶ ἐβούλετο φθάσαι μάλιστα μὲν οὖν τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν , πρίν τι ἐνδοῦναι , εἰ δὲ μή , τὴν Ἠιόνα προκαταλαβών .
On hearing the news, he set sail with the greatest speed, with seven ships which happened to be there; wishing, if possible, to reach Amphipolis in time, before any surrender was made, or, at any rate, to reach Eion.


4.105.1
3190
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ὁ Βρασίδας δεδιὼς καὶ τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς Θάσου τῶν νεῶν βοήθειαν καὶ πυνθανόμενος τὸν Θουκυδίδην κτῆσίν τε ἔχειν τῶν χρυσείων μετάλλων ἐργασίας ἐν τῇ περὶ ταῦτα Θρᾴκῃ καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ δύνασθαι ἐν τοῖς πρώτοις τῶν ἠπειρωτῶν , ἠπείγετο προκατασχεῖν , εἰ δύναιτο , τὴν πόλιν , μὴ ἀφικνουμένου αὐτοῦ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν Ἀμφιπολιτῶν , ἐλπίσαν ἐκ θαλάσσης ξυμμαχικὸν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Θρᾴκης ἀγείραντα αὐτὸν περιποιήσειν σφᾶς , οὐκέτι προσχωροίη .
In the mean time Brasidas, being afraid of the naval succour from Thasos, and hearing that Thucydides possessed the right of working the gold mines in those parts of Thrace, and by this means had influence amongst the chief persons on the mainland, made haste to get possession of the town beforehand, if possible; lest, if he came, the populace of Amphipolis, hoping that he would raise a confederate force from the sea and from Thrace, and so save them, should not then surrender to him.


4.105.2
3191
καὶ τὴν ξύμβασιν μετρίαν ἐποιεῖτο , κήρυγμα τόδε ἀνειπών , Ἀμφιπολιτῶν καὶ Ἀθηναίων τῶν ἐνόντων τὸν μὲν βουλόμενον ἐπὶ τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ τῆς ἴσης καὶ ὁμοίας μετέχοντα μένειν , τὸν δὲ μὴ ἐθέλοντα ἀπιέναι τὰ ἑαυτοῦ ἐκφερόμενον πέντε ἡμερῶν .
Accordingly he was willing to come to moderate terms with them, and made this proclamation; that of the Amphipolitans and Athenians in the town whoever would might remain in possession of his property, sharing in a fair and equal government; and whoever would not, might depart and take out his property with him, within five days.


4.106.1
3192
οἱ δὲ πολλοὶ ἀκούσαντες ἀλλοιότεροι ἐγένοντο τὰς γνώμας , ἄλλως τε καὶ βραχὺ μὲν Ἀθηναίων ἐμπολιτεῦον , τὸ δὲ πλέον ξύμμεικτον , καὶ τῶν ἔξω ληφθέντων συχνοῖς οἰκεῖοι ἔνδον ἦσαν ·
The mass of the people, on hearing this, rather changed their minds; especially as only a small number of Athenians were citizens of the place, the majority being a mixed multitude.


4.106.1
3193
καὶ τὸ κήρυγμα πρὸς τὸν φόβον δίκαιον εἶναι ὑπελάμβανον , οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι διὰ τὸ ἄσμενοι ἂν ἐξελθεῖν , ἡγούμενοι οὐκ ἐν ὁμοίῳ σφίσι τὰ δεινὰ εἶναι καὶ ἅμα οὐ προσδεχόμενοι βοήθειαν ἐν τάχει , ὁ δὲ ἄλλος ὅμιλος πόλεώς τε ἐν τῷ ἴσῳ οὐ στερισκόμενοι καὶ κινδύνου παρὰ δόξαν ἀφιέμενοι .
There were also within the walls many relations of those who had been taken without; and they considered the proclamation to be reasonable, when measured by the standard of their fear. The Athenians took this view of it, because they were glad to go out, thinking that the danger was greater for them than the rest, and, besides, not expecting any speedy relief; the rest of the multitude, because they were not to be deprived of their franchise, on an equal footing, and were released from peril beyond their expectation.


4.106.2
3194
ὥστε τῶν πρασσόντων τῷ Βρασίδᾳ ἤδη καὶ ἐκ τοῦ φανεροῦ διαδικαιούντων αὐτά , ἐπειδὴ καὶ τὸ πλῆθος ἑώρων τετραμμένον καὶ τοῦ παρόντος Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοῦ οὐκέτι ἀκροώμενον , ἐγένετο ἡ ὁμολογία καὶ προσεδέξαντο ἐφ’ οἷς ἐκήρυξεν .
When therefore the partisans of Brasidas now openly advocated these proposals, on seeing that the populace had changed their minds, and no longer listened to the Athenian commander, who was present;


4.106.3
3195
καὶ οἱ μὲν τὴν πόλιν τοιούτῳ τρόπῳ παρέδοσαν , ὁ δὲ Θουκυδίδης καὶ αἱ νῆες ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὀψὲ κατέπλεον ἐς τὴν Ἠιόνα .
the surrender was made, and they admitted him on the terms of his proclamation. In this way they delivered up the city; and Thucydides and his ships landed at Eion late on the same day.


4.106.4
3196
καὶ τὴν μὲν Ἀμφίπολιν Βρασίδας ἄρτι εἶχε , τὴν δὲ Ἠιόνα παρὰ νύκτα ἐγένετο λαβεῖν ·
Brasidas had just taken possession of Amphipolis, and was within a night of taking Eion;


4.106.4
3197
εἰ γὰρ μὴ ἐβοήθησαν αἱ νῆες διὰ τάχους , ἅμα ἕῳ ἂν εἴχετο .
for if the ships had not quickly come to its aid, in the morning it would have been in his hands.


4.107.1
3198
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ὁ μὲν τὰ ἐν τῇ Ἠιόνι καθίστατο , ὅπως καὶ τὸ αὐτίκα , ἢν ἐπίῃ ὁ Βρασίδας , καὶ τὸ ἔπειτα ἀσφαλῶς ἕξει , δεξάμενος τοὺς ἐθελήσαντας ἐπιχωρῆσαι ἄνωθεν κατὰ τὰς σπονδάς ·
After this, Thucydides arranged matters in Eion, so that it might be safe, both for the present time, if Brasidas should attack it, and in future; receiving into it those who had chosen to come there from up the country, according to the terms of the treaty.


4.107.2
3199
ὁ δὲ πρὸς μὲν τὴν Ἠιόνα κατά τε τὸν ποταμὸν πολλοῖς πλοίοις ἄφνω καταπλεύσας , εἴ πως τὴν προύχουσαν ἄκραν ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους λαβὼν κρατοίη τοῦ ἔσπλου , καὶ κατὰ γῆν ἀποπειράσας ἅμα , ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀπεκρούσθη , τὰ δὲ περὶ τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν ἐξηρτύετο .
And Brasidas suddenly sailed down the river to Eion, with a great number of boats, on the chance of taking the point of land which runs out from the wall, and so commanding the entrance into the place: and he attempted it by land at the same time; but was beaten off in both instances:


4.107.3
3200
καὶ Μύρκινός τε αὐτῷ προσεχώρησεν Ἠδωνικὴ πόλις , Πιττακοῦ τοῦ Ἠδώνων βασιλέως ἀποθανόντος ὑπὸ τῶν Γοάξιος παίδων καὶ Βραυροῦς τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ , καὶ Γαληψὸς οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον καὶ Οἰσύμη ·
At Amphipolis, however, he was putting everything in readiness. Myrcinus, an Edonian town, also came over to him; Pittacus, the king of the Edonians, having been killed by the sons of Goaxis, and Brauro his own wife.


4.107.3
3201
εἰσὶ δὲ αὗται Θασίων ἀποικίαι .
And not long after, Galepsus and Oesyme, colonies of the Thasians, did the same.


4.107.3
3202
παρὼν δὲ καὶ Περδίκκας εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν ἅλωσιν ξυγκαθίστη ταῦτα .
Perdiccas also came immediately after the capture of Amphipolis, and took part in these arrangements.


4.108.1
3203
ἐχομένης δὲ τῆς Ἀμφιπόλεως οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς μέγα δέος κατέστησαν , ἄλλως τε καὶ ὅτι ἡ πόλις αὐτοῖς ἦν ὠφέλιμος ξύλων τε ναυπηγησίμων πομπῇ καὶ χρημάτων προσόδῳ , καὶ ὅτι μέχρι μὲν τοῦ Στρυμόνος ἦν πάροδος Θεσσαλῶν διαγόντων ἐπὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους σφῶν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις , τῆς δὲ γεφύρας μὴ κρατούντων , ἄνωθεν μὲν μεγάλης οὔσης ἐπὶ πολὺ λίμνης τοῦ ποταμοῦ , τὰ δὲ πρὸς Ἠιόνα τριήρεσι τηρουμένων , οὐκ ἂν δύνασθαι προελθεῖν ·
When Amphipolis was in the enemy's hands, the Athenians were reduced to great fear, especially because the town was of service to them by supplying timber for ship building, and in point of payment of revenue; and because, though as far as the Strymon the Lacedaemonians had a passage open to them for reaching the allies of Athens, if the Thessalians allowed them to go through their country.


4.108.1
3204
τότε δὲ ῥᾴδια ἤδη ἐνόμιζεν γεγενῆσθαι .
Yet so long as they were not masters of the bridge, they could have gone no further; as on the inland side a large lake, formed by the river, spread for a great distance, while in the neighborhood of Eion they were watched by cruisers.


4.108.1
3205
καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐφοβοῦντο μὴ ἀποστῶσιν .
Then, however, they considered the difficulty as now removed, and feared lest their allies should revolt.


4.108.2
3206
ὁ γὰρ Βρασίδας ἔν τε τοῖς ἄλλοις μέτριον ἑαυτὸν παρεῖχε , καὶ ἐν τοῖς λόγοις πανταχοῦ ἐδήλου ὡς ἐλευθερώσων τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἐκπεμφθείη .
but now the passage was considered to have been rendered easy. They were also afraid that their allies would revolt.


4.108.3
3207
καὶ αἱ πόλεις πυνθανόμεναι αἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὑπήκοοι τῆς τε Ἀμφιπόλεως τὴν ἅλωσιν καὶ ἃ παρέχεται , τήν τε ἐκείνου πραότητα , μάλιστα δὴ ἐπήρθησαν ἐς τὸ νεωτερίζειν , καὶ ἐπεκηρυκεύοντο πρὸς αὐτὸν κρύφα , ἐπιπαριέναι τε κελεύοντες καὶ βουλόμενοι αὐτοὶ ἕκαστοι πρῶτοι ἀποστῆναι .
For Brasidas both showed himself moderate in other respects, and in his speeches every where declared that he was sent out to give freedom to Greece. And the cities subject to Athens, hearing of the capture of Amphipolis, and what advantages it enjoyed, and the gentleness of Brasidas, were most strongly encouraged to make innovations, and sent secret messages to him, desiring him to come to them, and each wishing to be the first to revolt.


4.108.4
3208
καὶ γὰρ καὶ ἄδεια ἐφαίνετο αὐτοῖς , ἐψευσμένοις μὲν τῆς Ἀθηναίων δυνάμεως ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον ὅση ὕστερον διεφάνη , τὸ δὲ πλέον βουλήσει κρίνοντες ἀσαφεῖ ἢ προνοίᾳ ἀσφαλεῖ , εἰωθότες οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗ μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦσιν ἐλπίδι ἀπερισκέπτῳ διδόναι , ὃ δὲ μὴ προσίενται λογισμῷ αὐτοκράτορι διωθεῖσθαι .
For they thought they might do it with security; their mistake in the estimate of the Athenian power being as great as power afterwards showed itself, and their judgment resting on blind desire, rather than on safe forethought: since men are accustomed to grant to inconsiderate hope whatever they;


4.108.5
3209
ἅμα δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐν τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς νεωστὶ πεπληγμένων καὶ τοῦ Βρασίδου ἐφολκὰ καὶ οὐ τὰ ὄντα λέγοντος , ὡς αὐτῷ ἐπὶ Νίσαιαν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ μόνῃ στρατιᾷ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ξυμβαλεῖν , ἐθάρσουν καὶ ἐπίστευον μηδένα ἂν ἐπὶ σφᾶς βοηθῆσαι .
but to thrust aside with despotic reasoning whatever they do not like. Besides, as the Athenians had lately met with a heavy blow in Boeotia, and Brasidas asserted what was attractive, but not true, that the Athenians had been unwilling to fight him at Nisaea with his own force alone, they were full of confidence, and believed that no one would come against them.


4.108.6
3210
τὸ δὲ μέγιστον , διὰ τὸ ἡδονὴν ἔχον ἐν τῷ αὐτίκα καὶ ὅτι τὸ πρῶτον Λακεδαιμονίων ὀργώντων ἔμελλον πειράσεσθαι , κινδυνεύειν παντὶ τρόπῳ ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν .
Above all, from regard to what was agreeable at the moment, and because they would be likely to find the Lacedaemonians zealous in their behalf at first, they were ready on all accounts to run the risk.


4.108.6
3211
ὧν αἰσθανόμενοι οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι φυλακάς , ὡς ἐξ ὀλίγου καὶ ἐν χειμῶνι , διέπεμπον ἐς τὰς πόλεις , ὁ δὲ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα ἐφιέμενος στρατιάν τε προσαποστέλλειν ἐκέλευε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ Στρυμόνι ναυπηγίαν τριήρων παρεσκευάζετο .
The Athenians perceiving this, distributed guards in the different states as well as they could in a short time, and in the winter season; while Brasidas sent despatches to Lacedaemon, begging them to send him additional forces, and himself prepared for building triremes in the Strymon.


4.108.7
3212
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὰ μὲν καὶ φθόνῳ ἀπὸ τῶν πρώτων ἀνδρῶν οὐχ ὑπηρέτησαν αὐτῷ , τὰ δὲ καὶ βουλόμενοι μᾶλλον τούς τε ἄνδρας τοὺς ἐκ τῆς νήσου κομίσασθαι καὶ τὸν πόλεμον καταλῦσαι .
But the Lacedaemonians did not comply with his wishes, partly through envy felt by the principal men, and partly because they were more anxious to recover the men taken in the island, and to bring the war to a conclusion.


4.109.1
3213
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος Μεγαρῆς τε τὰ μακρὰ τείχη , ἃ σφῶν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι εἶχον , κατέσκαψαν ἑλόντες ἐς ἔδαφος , καὶ Βρασίδας μετὰ τὴν Ἀμφιπόλεως ἅλωσιν ἔχων τοὺς ξυμμάχους στρατεύει ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀκτὴν καλουμένην .
The same winter the Megareans took and razed to their foundations the long walls in their country which the Athenians had held; and Brasidas, after the capture of Amphipolis, marched with his allies against the territory called Acte.


4.109.2
3214
ἔστι δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως διορύγματος ἔσω προύχουσα , καὶ ὁ Ἄθως αὐτῆς ὄρος ὑψηλὸν τελευτᾷ ἐς τὸ Αἰγαῖον πέλαγος .
This territory runs out from the king's dike on the inner side of the isthmus, Athos, a high mountain which stands in it, being its boundary on the side of the Aegean Sea.


4.109.3
3215
πόλεις δὲ ἔχει Σάνην μὲν Ἀνδρίων ἀποικίαν παρ’ αὐτὴν τὴν διώρυχα , ἐς τὸ πρὸς Εὔβοιαν πέλαγος τετραμμένην , τὰς δὲ ἄλλας Θυσσὸν καὶ Κλεωνὰς καὶ Ἀκροθῴους καὶ Ὀλόφυξον καὶ Δῖον ·
Of the towns it contains, one is Sane, a colony of the Andrians close to the dike, facing the sea towards Euboea; the others are Thyssus, Cleonae, Acrothoi, Olophyxus, and Dium.


4.109.4
3216
αἳ οἰκοῦνται ξυμμείκτοις ἔθνεσι βαρβάρων διγλώσσων , καί τι καὶ Χαλκιδικὸν ἔνι βραχύ , τὸ δὲ πλεῖστον Πελασγικόν , τῶν καὶ Λῆμνόν ποτε καὶ Ἀθήνας Τυρσηνῶν οἰκησάντων , καὶ Βισαλτικὸν καὶ Κρηστωνικὸν καὶ Ἠδῶνες ·
These are inhabited by mixed races of men speaking two different languages, a small portion of them being Chalcidians, but the main part Pelasgians—a tribe of those Tyrrhenians who once settled in Lemnos and Athens—Bisaltians, Crestonians, and Edonians;


4.109.4
3217
κατὰ δὲ μικρὰ πολίσματα οἰκοῦσιν .
and they live in small towns.


4.109.5
3218
καὶ οἱ μὲν πλείους προσεχώρησαν τῷ Βρασίδᾳ , Σάνη δὲ καὶ Δῖον ἀντέστη , καὶ αὐτῶν τὴν χώραν ἐμμείνας τῷ στρατῷ ἐδῄου .
The greater part of them surrendered to Brasidas, but Sane and Dium held out against him; and, accordingly, he stayed with his army in their territory, and laid it waste.


4.110.1
3219
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἐσήκουον , εὐθὺς στρατεύει ἐπὶ Τορώνην τὴν Χαλκιδικήν , κατεχομένην ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων ·
When they did not listen to his proposals, he marched straightway against Torone in Chalcidice, which was held by the Athenians.


4.110.1
3220
καὶ αὐτὸν ἄνδρες ὀλίγοι ἐπήγοντο , ἑτοῖμοι ὄντες τὴν πόλιν παραδοῦναι .
Being invited by a few persons who were prepared to deliver up the town to him.


4.110.1
3221
καὶ ἀφικόμενος νυκτὸς ἔτι καὶ περὶ ὄρθρον τῷ στρατῷ ἐκαθέζετο πρὸς τὸ Διοσκόρεον ,ὃ ἀπέχει τῆς πόλεως τρεῖς μάλιστα σταδίους .
Having arrived while it was yet night, and just about daybreak, he sat down with his army near the temple of the Dioscuri, distant from the town about three stades.


4.110.2
3222
τὴν μὲν οὖν ἄλλην πόλιν τῶν Τορωναίων καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τοὺς ἐμφρουροῦντας ἔλαθεν ·
Now by the rest of the town of the Toronaeans, and by the Athenians who were in garrison in it, he was not observed.


4.110.2
3223
οἱ δὲ πράσσοντες αὐτῷ εἰδότες ὅτι ἥξοι , καὶ προελθόντες τινὲς αὐτῶν λάθρᾳ ὀλίγοι , ἐτήρουν τὴν πρόσοδον , καὶ ὡς ᾔσθοντο παρόντα , ἐσκομίζουσι παρ’ αὑτοὺς ἐγχειρίδια ἔχοντας ἄνδρας ψιλοὺς ἑπτά ( τοσοῦτοι γὰρ μόνοι ἀνδρῶν εἴκοσι τὸ πρῶτον ταχθέντων οὐ κατέδεισαν ἐσελθεῖν ·
But his partisans, knowing that he would come, and some few of them having privately visited him, were watching for his arrival. And when they found that he was come, they took in to them seven light-armed men with daggers; (for such only was the number, out of twenty who were at first appointed to the work, that were not afraid to enter, their commander being Lysistratus, an Olynthian.)


4.110.2
3224
ἦρχε δὲ αὐτῶν Λυσίστρατος Ὀλύνθιος ) , οἳ διαδύντες διὰ τοῦ πρὸς τὸ πέλαγος τείχους καὶ λαθόντες τούς τε ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀνωτάτω φυλακτηρίου φρουρούς , οὔσης τῆς πόλεως πρὸς λόφον , ἀναβάντες διέφθειραν καὶ τὴν κατὰ Καναστραῖον πυλίδα διῄρουν .
```plaintext


4.111.1
3225
ὁ δὲ Βρασίδας τῷ μὲν ἄλλῳ στρατῷ ἡσύχαζεν ὀλίγον προελθών , ἑκατὸν δὲ πελταστὰς προπέμπει , ὅπως , ὁπότε πύλαι τινὲς ἀνοιχθεῖεν καὶ τὸ σημεῖον ἀρθείη ὃ ξυνέκειτο , πρῶτοι ἐσδράμοιεν .
Brasidas, meanwhile, after advancing a short distance, remained quiet with the rest of his army, but sent forward a hundred targeteers, that when any gates were opened, and the signal raised which had been agreed on, they might be the first to rush in.


4.111.2
3226
καὶ οἱ μὲν χρόνου ἐγγιγνομένου καὶ θαυμάζοντες κατὰ μικρὸν ἔτυχον ἐγγὺς τῆς πόλεως προσελθόντες ·
These, having waited some time, and wondering at the delay, had come by degrees near the town;


4.111.2
3227
οἱ δὲ τῶν Τορωναίων ἔνδοθεν παρασκευάζοντες μετὰ τῶν ἐσεληλυθότων , ὡς αὐτοῖς ἥ τε πυλὶς διῄρητο καὶ αἱ κατὰ τὴν ἀγορὰν πύλαι τοῦ μοχλοῦ διακοπέντος ἀνεῴγοντο , πρῶτον μὲν κατὰ τὴν πυλίδα τινὰς περιαγαγόντες ἐσεκόμισαν , ὅπως κατὰ νώτου καὶ ἀμφοτέρωθεν τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει οὐδὲν εἰδότας ἐξαπίνης φοβήσειαν , ἔπειτα τὸ σημεῖόν τε τοῦ πυρός , ὡς εἴρητο , ἀνέσχον , καὶ διὰ τῶν κατὰ τὴν ἀγορὰν πυλῶν τοὺς λοιποὺς ἤδη τῶν πελταστῶν ἐσεδέχοντο .
while those of the Toronaeans within, who were preparing matters with the party that had entered, after the postern had been broken open by them, and the gates leading to the market-place opened by cutting through the bar, in the first place brought a party round to the postern and introduced them, that in their rear, and on both sides of them, they might suddenly strike terror into the townsmen, knowing nothing of what was going on. Next they raised the fire-signal as had been appointed; and then received the rest of the targeteers through the gates leading to the market-place.


4.112.1
3228
καὶ ὁ Βρασίδας ἰδὼν τὸ ξύνθημα ἔθει δρόμῳ , ἀναστήσας τὸν στρατὸν ἐμβοήσαντάς τε ἁθρόον καὶ ἔκπληξιν πολλὴν τοῖς ἐν τῇ πόλει παρασχόντας .
And now Brasidas, on seeing the appointed signal, ordered his troops to rise, after giving a shout all together, and causing much consternation to those in the town, and ran at full speed.


4.112.2
3229
καὶ οἱ μὲν κατὰ τὰς πύλας εὐθὺς ἐσέπιπτον , οἱ δὲ κατὰ δοκοὺς τετραγώνους , αἳ ἔτυχον τῷ τείχει πεπτωκότι καὶ οἰκοδομουμένῳ πρὸς λίθων ἀνολκὴν προσκείμεναι .
Some immediately burst in through the gates, others over some square timbers that happened to be lying by the wall, which had fallen and was being re-built, for the purpose of drawing up stones.


4.112.3
3230
Βρασίδας μὲν οὖν καὶ τὸ πλῆθος εὐθὺς ἄνω καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ μετέωρα τῆς πόλεως ἐτράπετο , βουλόμενος κατ’ ἄκρας καὶ βεβαίως ἑλεῖν αὐτήν ·
Brasidas, therefore, and the greatest part of the troops turned immediately up to the highest parts of the town, wishing to take it from top to bottom, and securely;


4.112.3
3231
ὁ δὲ ἄλλος ὅμιλος κατὰ πάντα ὁμοίως ἐσκεδάννυντο .
the rest of the multitude spread in all directions alike.


4.113.1
3232
τῶν δὲ Τορωναίων γιγνομένης τῆς ἁλώσεως τὸ μὲν πολὺ οὐδὲν εἰδὸς ἐθορυβεῖτο , οἱ δὲ πράσσοντες καὶ οἷς ταῦτα ἤρεσκε μετὰ τῶν ἐσελθόντων εὐθὺς ἦσαν .
While the capture of Torone was being effected, the mass of the people, knowing nothing of the matter, was confounded; but the conspirators, and such as were pleased with the proceedings, straightway joined those who had entered the town.


4.113.2
3233
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἔτυχον γὰρ ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ὁπλῖται καθεύδοντες ὡς πεντήκοντα ) ἐπειδὴ ᾔσθοντο , οἱ μέν τινες ὀλίγοι διαφθείρονται ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν , τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν οἱ μὲν πεζῇ , οἱ δὲ ἐς τὰς ναῦς , αἳ ἐφρούρουν δύο , καταφυγόντες διασῴζονται ἐς τὴν Λήκυθον τὸ φρούριον , ὃ εἶχον αὐτοὶ καταλαβόντες , ἄκρον τῆς πόλεως ἐς τὴν θάλασσαν ἀπειλημμένον ἐν στενῷ ἰσθμῷ .
When the Athenians (for there happened to be about fifty heavy-armed sleeping in the market-place) were aware of it, some few of them were killed in close combat; of the rest, some fled by land, others to their ships, (for there were two keeping guard there,) and escaped to Lecythus, the fort which they held themselves, having occupied a corner of the town running out into the sea, and cut off by its position on a narrow isthmus.


4.113.3
3234
κατέφυγον δὲ καὶ τῶν Τορωναίων ἐς αὐτοὺς ὅσοι ἦσαν σφίσιν ἐπιτήδειοι .
As many of the Toronaeans also as were on their side, took refuge with them.


4.114.1
3235
γεγενημένης δὲ ἡμέρας ἤδη καὶ βεβαίως τῆς πόλεως ἐχομένης ὁ Βρασίδας τοῖς μὲν μετὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων Τορωναίοις καταπεφευγόσι κήρυγμα ἐποιήσατο τὸν βουλόμενον ἐπὶ τὰ ἑαυτοῦ ἐξελθόντα ἀδεῶς πολιτεύειν , τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις κήρυκα προσπέμψας ἐξιέναι ἐκέλευεν ἐκ τῆς Ληκύθου ὑποσπόνδους καὶ τὰ ἑαυτῶν ἔχοντας ὡς οὔσης Χαλκιδέων .
When it was now day, and the town was safely in his possession, Brasidas made a proclamation to the Toronaeans who had taken refuge with the Athenians, that whoever wished should come out to his own property, and live in the town in security. To the Athenians he sent a herald, and told them to evacuate Lecythus under truce, with their property, as the place belonged to the Chalcidians.


4.114.2
3236
οἱ δὲ ἐκλείψειν μὲν οὐκ ἔφασαν , σπείσασθαι δὲ σφίσιν ἐκέλευον ἡμέραν τοὺς νεκροὺς ἀνελέσθαι .
They refused to evacuate it, but begged him to grant them a truce for one day, that they might take up their dead.


4.114.2
3237
ὁ δὲ ἐσπείσατο δύο .
He granted it for two days;


4.114.2
3238
ἐν ταύταις δὲ αὐτός τε τὰς ἐγγὺς οἰκίας ἐκρατύνατο καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ σφέτερα .
during which he himself fortified the neighbouring houses, and the Athenians their positions. Having convened also an assembly of the Toronaeans, he said nearly the same things as at Acanthus;


4.114.3
3239
καὶ ξύλλογον τῶν Τορωναίων ποιήσας ἔλεξε τοῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀκάνθῳ παραπλήσια , ὅτι οὐ δίκαιον εἴη οὔτε τοὺς πράξαντας πρὸς αὐτὸν τὴν λῆψιν τῆς πόλεως χείρους οὐδὲ προδότας ἡγεῖσθαι ( οὐ γὰρ ἐπὶ δουλείᾳ οὐδὲ χρήμασι πεισθέντας δρᾶσαι τοῦτο , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ ἀγαθῷ καὶ ἐλευθερίᾳ τῆς πόλεως ) οὔτε τοὺς μὴ μετασχόντας οἴεσθαι μὴ τῶν αὐτῶν τεύξεσθαι ·
that it was not right for them to regard as bad men, or traitors, those who had negotiated with them for the capture of the city; (for they had not done so to bring it into slavery, nor because they had been bribed, but for the advantage and liberty of the town;) nor for those who had taken no part in it to suppose that they would not reap the same benefits; for he had not come to destroy either city or individual.


4.114.3
3240
ἀφῖχθαι γὰρ οὐ διαφθερῶν οὔτε πόλιν οὔτε ἰδιώτην οὐδένα .
For this reason he had made the proclamation to those who had fled for refuge to the Athenians, as he had none the worse opinion of them for their friendship to them.


4.114.4
3241
τὸ δὲ κήρυγμα ποιήσασθαι τούτου ἕνεκα τοῖς παρ’ Ἀθηναίους καταπεφευγόσιν , ὡς ἡγούμενος οὐδὲν χείρους τῇ ἐκείνων φιλία ·
and he thought that when they had made trial of the Lacedaemonians, they would not be less kindly disposed towards them, but far more so, inasmuch as they were acting more justly:


4.114.4
3242
οὐδ’ ἂν σφῶν πειρασαμένους αὐτοὺς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων δοκεῖν ἧσσον , ἀλλὰ πολλῷ μᾶλλον , ὅσῳ δικαιότερα πράσσουσιν , εὔνους ἂν σφίσι γενέσθαι , ἀπειρίᾳ δὲ νῦν πεφοβῆσθαι .
but as it was, through want of such a trial, they were afraid of them.


4.114.5
3243
τούς τε πάντας παρασκευάζεσθαι ἐκέλευεν ὡς βεβαίους τε ἐσομένους ξυμμάχους καὶ τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε ἤδη ὅτι ἂν ἁμαρτάνωσιν αἰτίαν ἕξοντας ·
And he desired them all to prepare for being stanch allies, and for having to answer in future for whatever they did amiss:


4.114.5
3244
τὰ δὲ πρότερα οὐ σφεῖς ἀδικεῖσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἐκείνους μᾶλλον ὑπ’ ἄλλων κρεισσόνων , καὶ ξυγγνώμην εἶναι εἴ τι ἠναντιοῦντο .
but as regarded the past, it was not the Lacedaemonians that were injured, but themselves rather, by others who were too strong for them; and so allowance was to be made for any thing in which they had opposed him.


4.115.1
3245
καὶ ὁ μὲν τοιαῦτα εἰπὼν καὶ παραθαρσύνας διελθουσῶν τῶν σπονδῶν τὰς προσβολὰς ἐποιεῖτο τῇ Ληκύθῳ ·
Having thus addressed and encouraged them, on the expiration of the truce, he made his assault upon Lecythus;


4.115.1
3246
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἠμύνοντό τε ἐκ φαύλου τειχίσματος καὶ ἀπ’ οἰκιῶν ἐπάλξεις ἐχουσῶν , καὶ μίαν μὲν ἡμέραν ἀπεκρούσαντο ·
while the Athenians defended themselves from a poor wall, and from some houses that had battlements. For one day they beat him off;


4.115.2
3247
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ μηχανῆς μελλούσης προσάξεσθαι αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐναντίων , ἀφ’ ἧς πῦρ ἐνήσειν διενοοῦντο ἐς τὰ ξύλινα παραφράγματα , καὶ προσιόντος ἤδη τοῦ στρατεύματος , ᾗ ᾤοντο μάλιστα αὐτοὺς προσκομιεῖν τὴν μηχανὴν καὶ ἦν ἐπιμαχώτατον , πύργον ξύλινον ἐπ’ οἴκημα ἀντέστησαν , καὶ ὕδατος ἀμφορέας πολλοὺς καὶ πίθους ἀνεφόρησαν καὶ λίθους μεγάλους , ἄνθρωποί τε πολλοὶ ἀνέβησαν .
but on the next, when an engine was going to be brought up against them by the enemy, from which they intended to throw fire on the wooden defences, and when the army was now advancing where they thought they should best bring up the engine, and where the place was most assailable, the defenders placed a wooden tower on the wall opposite to them, and carried up on to it many jars and casks of water, with large stones, an a large party of men ascended it.


4.115.3
3248
τὸ δὲ οἴκημα λαβὸν μεῖζον ἄχθος ἐξαπίνης κατερράγη καὶ ψόφου πολλοῦ γενομένου τοὺς μὲν ἐγγὺς καὶ ὁρῶντας τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐλύπησε μᾶλλον ἢ ἐφόβησεν , οἱ δὲ ἄπωθεν , καὶ μάλιστα οἱ διὰ πλείστου , νομίσαντες ταύτῃ ἑαλωκέναι ἤδη τὸ χωρίον , φυγῇ ἐς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ τὰς ναῦς ὥρμησαν .
But the building, having had too great a weight put on it, suddenly broke down, and making a loud noise, vexed more than it terrified those of the Athenians who were near and saw it; but those who were at a distance, and most of all those who were at the greatest, thinking that the place was already taken in that quarter, hurried away, and fled to the sea and to their ships.


4.116.1
3249
καὶ ὁ Βρασίδας ὡς ᾔσθετο αὐτοὺς ἀπολείποντάς τε τὰς ἐπάλξεις καὶ τὸ γιγνόμενον ὁρῶν , ἐπιφερόμενος τῷ στρατῷ εὐθὺς τὸ τείχισμα λαμβάνει , καὶ ὅσους ἐγκατέλαβε διέφθειρεν .
When Brasidas perceived that they were deserting the battlements, and saw what was going on, he rushed up with his army, d immediately took the fort, and put to the sword as many s he found in it.


4.116.2
3250
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι τοῖς τε πλοίοις καὶ ταῖς ναυσὶ τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἐκλιπόντες τὸ χωρίον ἐς Παλλήνην διεκομίσθησαν ·
The Athenians in this way evacuated the race, and went across in their boats and ships to Pallene.


4.116.2
3251
ὁ δὲ Βρασίδας ( ἔστι γὰρ ἐν τῇ Ληκύθῳ Ἀθηνᾶς ἱερόν , καὶ ἔτυχε κηρύξας , ὅτε ἔμελλε προσβαλεῖν ,τῷ ἐπιβάντι πρώτῳ τοῦ τείχους τριάκοντα μνᾶς ἀργυρίου δώσειν ) νομίσας ἄλλῳ τινὶ τρόπῳ ἢ ἀνθρωπείῳ τὴν ἅλωσιν γενέσθαι , τάς τε τριάκοντα μνᾶς τῇ θεῷ ἀπέδωκεν ἐς τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ τὴν Λήκυθον καθελὼν καὶ ἀνασκευάσας τέμενος ἀνῆκεν ἅπαν .
Now there is in Lecythus a temple of Minerva; and Brasidas had proclaimed, when he was about to make the assault, that the man who first scaled the wall he would give thirty minae of silver. Thinking, therefore, that the capture had been effected by other means than human, he presented the thirty minae to the goddess, for the use of her temple; and having razed and cleared Lecythus, he devoted the whole as sacred ground.


4.116.3
3252
καὶ ὁ μὲν τὸ λοιπὸν τοῦ χειμῶνος ἅ τε εἶχε τῶν χωρίων καθίστατο καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐπεβούλευεν ·
During the remainder of the winter, he was settling the affairs of the places in his possession, and forming designs against others.


4.116.3
3253
καὶ τοῦ χειμῶνος διελθόντος ὄγδοον ἔτος ἐτελεύτα τῷ πολέμῳ .
And at the expiration of the winter, the eighth year of this war ended.


4.117.1
3254
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι ἅμα ἦρι τοῦ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους εὐθὺς ἐκεχειρίαν ἐποιήσαντο ἐνιαύσιον , νομίσαντες Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν οὐκ ἂν ἔτι τὸν Βρασίδαν σφῶν προσαποστῆσαι οὐδὲν πρὶν παρασκευάσαιντο καθ’ ἡσυχίαν , καὶ ἅμα , εἰ καλῶς σφίσιν ἔχοι , καὶ ξυμβῆναι τὰ πλείω , Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ ταῦτα τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἡγούμενοι ἅπερ ἐδέδισαν φοβεῖσθαι , καὶ γενομένης ἀνοκωχῆς κακῶν καὶ ταλαιπωρίας μᾶλλον ἐπιθυμήσειν αὐτοὺς πειρασαμένους ξυναλλαγῆναί τε καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας σφίσιν ἀποδόντας σπονδὰς ποιήσασθαι καὶ ἐς τὸν πλείω χρόνον .
At the commencement of the spring of the following summer, the Lacedaemonians and Athenians immediately concluded an armistice for a year; the Athenians considering that Brasidas would then no longer win any more of their towns to revolt, before they had made their preparations for securing them at their leisure; and at the same time, that if it were for their interest, they might conclude a general peace: while the Lacedaemonians thought that the Athenians feared what they really were afraid of; and that after having a suspension of their miseries and suffering, they would be more desirous, from their taste of it, to effect a reconciliation, and, restoring their men, to make a treaty for a longer time.


4.117.2
3255
τοὺς γὰρ δὴ ἄνδρας περὶ πλέονος ἐποιοῦντο κομίσασθαι , ὡς ἔτι Βρασίδας ηὐτύχει ·
For they deemed it of greater importance to recover their men at a time when Brasidas was still prosperous.


4.117.2
3256
καὶ ἔμελλον ἐπὶ μεῖζον χωρήσαντος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀντίπαλα καταστήσαντος τῶν μὲν στέρεσθαι , τοῖς δ’ ἐκ τοῦ ἴσου ἀμυνόμενοι κινδυνεύσειν καὶ κρατήσειν .
And, [on the other hand,] if he reached a still greater measure of success, and put matters on an equality, they were likely to lose those men, and while defending themselves with their others, on equal terms, still to run a risk of not gaining the mastery.


4.117.3
3257
γίγνεται οὖν ἐκεχειρία αὐτοῖς τε καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις ἥδε .
An armistice was therefore concluded by them and their allies on the following terms:


4.118.1
3258
&quot; περὶ μὲν τοῦ ἱεροῦ καὶ τοῦ μαντείου τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τοῦ Πυθίου δοκεῖ ἡμῖν χρῆσθαι τὸν βουλόμενον ἀδόλως καὶ ἀδεῶς κατὰ τοὺς πατρίους νόμους .
"With regard to the temple and oracle of the Pythian Apollo, we agree that any one who wishes, may have access to it, without deceit, and without fear, according to the laws of our respective countries.


4.118.2
3259
τοῖς μὲν Λακεδαιμονίοις ταῦτα δοκεῖ καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις τοῖς παροῦσιν ·
The Lacedaemonians, and such of the allies as are present, agree to this.


4.118.2
3260
Βοιωτοὺς δὲ καὶ Φωκέας πείσειν φασὶν ἐς δύναμιν προσκηρυκευόμενοι .
They declare that they will, to the best of their power, persuade the Boeotians and Phocians to do so, by sending heralds to them on the subject.


4.118.3
3261
περὶ δὲ τῶν χρημάτων τῶν τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπιμέλεσθαι ὅπως τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας ἐξευρήσομεν , ὀρθῶς καὶ δικαίως τοῖς πατρίοις νόμοις χρώμενοι καὶ ὑμεῖς καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ τῶν ἄλλων οἱ βουλόμενοι , τοῖς πατρίοις νόμοις χρώμενοι πάντες .
"With regard to the treasures of the god, we agree to exert ourselves to find out such as unjustly meddle with them, uprightly and honestly acting in accordance with the laws of our forefathers, both we, and you, and such of the rest as may consent to this


4.118.4
3262
περὶ μὲν οὖν τούτων ἔδοξε Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ξυμμάχοις κατὰ ταῦτα ·
On these points, then, the Lacedaemonians and the rest of the allies agree, according to the terms mentioned.


4.118.4
3263
τάδε δὲ ἔδοξε Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ξυμμάχοις ἐὰν σπονδὰς ποιῶνται οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἐπὶ τῆς αὐτῶν μένειν ἑκατέρους ἔχοντας ἅπερ νῦν ἔχομεν , τοὺς μὲν ἐν τῷ Κορυφασίῳ ἐντὸς τῆς Βουφράδος καὶ τοῦ Τομέως μένοντας , τοὺς δὲ ἐν Κυθήροις μὴ ἐπιμισγομένους ἐς τὴν ξυμμαχίαν , μήτε ἡμᾶς πρὸς αὐτοὺς μήτε αὐτοὺς πρὸς ἡμᾶς , τοὺς δ’ ἐν Νισαίᾳ καὶ Μινῴᾳ μὴ ὑπερβαίνοντας τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν πυλῶν τῶν παρὰ τοῦ Νίσου ἐπὶ τὸ Ποσειδώνιον , ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ Ποσειδωνίου εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τὴν γέφυραν τὴν ἐς Μινῴαν ( μηδὲ Μεγαρέας καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ὑπερβαίνειν τὴν ὁδὸν ταύτην ) καὶ τὴν νῆσον , ἥνπερ ἔλαβον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἔχοντας , μηδὲ ἐπιμισγομένους μηδετέρους μηδετέρωσε , καὶ τὰ ἐν Τροιζῆνι , ὅσαπερ νῦν ἔχουσι , καθ’ ἃ ξυνέθεντο πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ·
On the following points the Lacedaemonians and the rest of the allies agree, in case the Athenians make a treaty to that effect; that we shall each remain in our own territory, keeping what we now have; the garrison in Coryphasium confining themselves within the Buphras and Tomeus; that in Cythera holding no intercourse with the allied states, neither we with you, nor you with us; and that in Nisaea and Minoa not crossing the road, which runs from the gates leading from the temple of Nisus to that of Neptune, and from the temple of Neptune straight to the bridge at Minoa, (the Megareans and the allies being also bound not to cross this road,) and the Athenians retaining the island taken by them, without any communication on either side; and lastly, with regard to Troezen, that each party shall retain what they now possess.


4.118.5
3264
καὶ τῇ θαλάσσῃ χρωμένους , ὅσα ἂν κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτῶν καὶ κατὰ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν , Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους πλεῖν μὴ μακρᾷ νηί , ἄλλῳ δὲ κωπήρει πλοίῳ , ἐς πεντακόσια τάλαντα ἄγοντι μέτρα .
the Athenians. "With regard to the navigation of the sea, that along their own coast and that of their confederacy, the Lacedaemonians may sail, not in a ship of war, but in any other vessel rowed by oars, and carrying not more than


4.118.6
3265
κήρυκι δὲ καὶ πρεσβείᾳ καὶ ἀκολούθοις , ὁπόσοις ἂν δοκῇ , περὶ καταλύσεως τοῦ πολέμου καὶ δικῶν ἐς Πελοπόννησον καὶ Ἀθήναζε σπονδὰς εἶναι ἰοῦσι καὶ ἀπιοῦσι καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν .
500 talents tonnage. "That any herald, ambassadors, and attendants, as many as they may choose, on their way to the Peloponnese or to Athens, for bringing the war to a conclusion, and adjusting all claims, shall have free passage, going and returning, both by


4.118.7
3266
τοὺς δὲ αὐτομόλους μὴ δέχεσθαι ἐν τούτῳ τῷ χρόνῳ , μήτε ἐλεύθερον μήτε δοῦλον , μήτε ὑμᾶς μήτε ἡμᾶς .
land and by sea. That deserters shall not be received in the mean time, neither free nor bond, neither by


4.118.8
3267
δίκας τε διδόναι ὑμᾶς τε ἡμῖν καὶ ἡμᾶς ὑμῖν κατὰ τὰ πάτρια , τὰ ἀμφίλογα δίκῃ διαλύοντας ἄνευ πολέμου .
you nor by us. Further, that we shall give judicial satisfaction, both you to us and we to you, according to the laws of our respective countries, deciding all disputes by law,


4.118.9
3268
τοῖς μὲν Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις ταῦτα δοκεῖ ·
The Lacedaemonians and allies agree to these articles.


4.118.9
3269
εἰ δέ τι ὑμῖν εἴτε κάλλιον εἴτε δικαιότερον τούτων δοκεῖ εἶναι , ἰόντες ἐς Λακεδαίμονα διδάσκετε ·
But if you think any thing else either better or more just, come to Lacedaemon and explain your views; for neither the Lacedaemonians nor the allies will object to any thing you may say with justice.


4.118.9
3270
οὐδενὸς γὰρ ἀποστήσονται , ὅσα ἂν δίκαια λέγητε , οὔτε οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὔτε οἱ ξύμμαχοι .
But let those who come, come with full powers to treat.


4.118.10
3271
οἱ δὲ ἰόντες τέλος ἔχοντες ἰόντων , ᾗπερ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἡμᾶς κελεύετε .
As you also desire us. The truce shall continue one year.


4.118.10
3272
αἱ δὲ σπονδαὶ ἐνιαυτὸν ἔσονται .
The people [of Athens] ratified the truce.


4.118.11
3273
&quot; ἔδοξεν τῷ δήμῳ .
The tribe Acamantis had the prytany.


4.118.11
3274
Ἀκαμαντὶς ἐπρυτάνευε , Φαίνιππος ἐγραμμάτευε , Νικιάδης ἐπεστάτει .
Phoenippus was secretary; Niciades was chairman.


4.118.11
3275
Λάχης εἶπε , τύχῃ ἀγαθῇ τῇ Ἀθηναίων , ποιεῖσθαι τὴν ἐκεχειρίαν καθ’ ἃ ξυγχωροῦσι Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι αὐτῶν καὶ ὡμολόγησαν ἐν τῷ δήμῳ ·
Laches moved, 'that they do conclude the armistice, (and may they do it for the good fortune of Athens!) on the terms agreed to.


4.118.12
3276
τὴν δ’ ἐκεχειρίαν εἶναι ἐνιαυτόν , ἄρχειν δὲ τήνδε τὴν ἡμέραν , τετράδα ἐπὶ δέκα τοῦ Ἐλαφηβολιῶνος μηνός .
" by the Lacedaemonians and the allies.' And they agreed in the assembly of the people, 'that the armistice be for a year, commencing this very day, the"


4.118.13
3277
ἐν τούτῳ τῷ χρόνῳ ἰόντας ὡς ἀλλήλους πρέσβεις καὶ κήρυκας ποιεῖσθαι τοὺς λόγους , καθ’ ὅτι ἔσται ἡ κατάλυσις τοῦ πολέμου .
" fourteenth of the month of Elaphebolion; that, during that time, ambassadors and heralds shall proceed to each other's country, and discuss on what terms the war"


4.118.14
3278
ἐκκλησίαν δὲ ποιήσαντας τοὺς στρατηγοὺς καὶ τοὺς πρυτάνεις πρῶτον περὶ τῆς εἰρήνης G? βουλεύσασθαι Ἀθηναίους καθ’ ὅτι ἂν ἐσίῃ ἡ πρεσβεία περὶ τῆς καταλύσεως τοῦ πολέμου .
Shall be brought to a conclusion. That the generals and prytanes having summoned an assembly of the people, the Athenians shall, in the first place, consult on the peace, and on the manner in which the envoys for putting an end to the wars shall be admitted.


4.118.14
3279
σπείσασθαι δὲ αὐτίκα μάλα τὰς πρεσβείας ἐν τῷ δήμῳ τὰς παρούσας ἦ μὴν ἐμμενεῖν ἐν ταῖς σπονδαῖς τὸν ἐνιαυτόν .
That the envoys now present in the city shall immediately bind themselves in the presence of the people, that they will assuredly abide by this truce for the space of a year.


4.119.1
3280
&quot; ταῦτα ξυνέθεντο Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ ὤμοσαν καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι Ἀθηναίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις μηνὸς ἐν Λακεδαίμονι Γεραστίου δωδεκάτῃ .
To these articles the Lacedaemonians agreed, (their allies also swearing to them,) with the Athenians and their allies, on the twelfth day of the Spartan month Gerastius.


4.119.2
3281
ξυνετίθεντο δὲ καὶ ἐσπένδοντο Λακεδαιμονίων μὲν οἵδε ·
Those who agreed to the articles and ratified them by libations, were the following:


4.119.2
3282
Ταῦρος Ἐχετιμίδα , Ἀθήναιος Περικλείδα , Φιλοχαρίδας Ἐρυξιλαΐδα ·
**4.119.2.3282**  Of the Lacedaemonians, Taurus son of Echetimidas, Athenaeus son of Pericleidas, and Philocharidas son of Eryxidaidas.


4.119.2
3283
Κορινθίων δὲ Αἰνέας Ὠκύτου , Εὐφαμίδας Ἀριστωνύμου ·
Of the Corinthians, Aeneas son of Ocytus, and Euphamidas son of Aristonymus.


4.119.2
3284
Σικυωνίων δὲ Δαμότιμος Ναυκράτους , Ὀνάσιμος Μεγακλέους ·
Of the Sicyonians, Damotimus son of Naucrates, and Onasimus son of Megacles.


4.119.2
3285
Μεγαρέων δὲ Νίκασος Κεκάλου , Μενεκράτης Ἀμφιδώρου ·
Of the Megareans, Nicasus son of Cecalus, and Menecrates son of Amphidorus.


4.119.2
3286
Ἐπιδαυρίων δὲ Ἀμφίας Εὐπαιΐδα ·
Of the Epidaurians, Amphias son of Eupaidas.


4.119.2
3287
Ἀθηναίων δὲ οἱ στρατηγοὶ Νικόστρατος Διειτρέφους , Νικίας Νικηράτου , Αὐτοκλῆς Τολμαίου’ .
Of the Athenians, the generals Nicostratus son of Diitrephes, Nicias son of Niceratus, and Autocles son of Tolmaeus.


4.119.3
3288
ἡ μὲν δὴ ἐκεχειρία αὕτη ἐγένετο , καὶ ξυνῇσαν ἐν αὐτῇ περὶ τῶν μειζόνων σπονδῶν διὰ παντὸς ἐς λόγους .
of the Athenians, the following generals, Nicostratus son of Diitrephes, Nicias son of Niceratus, and Autocles son of Tolmaeus. This then was the armistice which was concluded; and during it they were throughout holding conferences for a more general treaty.


4.120.1
3289
περὶ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας αἷς ἐπήρχοντο Σκιώνη ἐν τῇ Παλλήνῃ πόλις ἀπέστη ἀπ’ Ἀθηναίων πρὸς Βρασίδαν .
About the time at which they were thus going backwards and forwards to each other, Scione, a town in Pallene, revolted from the Athenians to Brasidas.


4.120.1
3290
φασὶ δὲ οἱ Σκιωναῖοι Πελληνῆς μὲν εἶναι ἐκ Πελοποννήσου , πλέοντας δ’ ἀπὸ Τροίας σφῶν τοὺς πρώτους κατενεχθῆναι ἐς τὸ χωρίον τοῦτο τῷ χειμῶνι ᾧ ἐχρήσαντο Ἀχαιοί , καὶ αὐτοῦ οἰκῆσαι .
Now these Scionaeans say that they are Palleneans from the Peloponnese, and that their first founders, while on their voyage from Troy, were carried to this place by the storm which the Achaeans experienced, and there took up their abode.


4.120.2
3291
ἀποστᾶσι δ’ αὐτοῖς ὁ Βρασίδας διέπλευσε νυκτὸς ἐς τὴν Σκιώνην , τριήρει μὲν φιλίᾳ προπλεούσῃ , αὐτὸς δὲ ἐν κελητίῳ ἄπωθεν ἐφεπόμενος , ὅπως , εἰ μέν τινι τοῦ κέλητος μείζονι πλοίῳ περιτυγχάνοι , ἡ τριήρης ἀμύνοι αὐτῷ , ἀντιπάλου δὲ ἄλλης τριήρους ἐπιγενομένης οὐ πρὸς τὸ ἔλασσον νομίζων τρέψεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τὴν ναῦν , καὶ ἐν τούτῳ αὑτὸν διασώσειν .
On their revolting, Brasidas crossed over to Scione by night, with a friendly trireme sailing ahead of him, and himself following at some distance in a skiff; that in case of his falling in with any vessel larger than the skiff, the trireme might come to his aid; while if another trireme of equal force came against them, he thought that it would not turn upon the smaller vessel, but upon the ship, and in the mean time he should make his escape. Having thus crossed over, and convened an assembly of the Scionaeans, he spoke to the same effect as at Acanthus and Torone:


4.120.3
3292
περαιωθεὶς δὲ καὶ ξύλλογον ποιήσας τῶν Σκιωναίων ἔλεγεν ἅ τε ἐν τῇ Ἀκάνθῳ καὶ Τορώνῃ , καὶ προσέτι φάσκων ἀξιωτάτους αὐτοὺς εἶναι ἐπαίνου , οἵτινες τῆς Παλλήνης ἐν τῷ ἰσθμῷ ἀπειλημμένης ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων Ποτείδαιαν ἐχόντων καὶ ὄντες οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἢ νησιῶται αὐτεπάγγελτοι ἐχώρησαν πρὸς τὴν ἐλευθερίαν καὶ οὐκ ἀνέμειναν ἀτολμίᾳ ἀνάγκην σφίσι προσγενέσθαι περὶ τοῦ φανερῶς οἰκείου ἀγαθοῦ ·
Having crossed over and convened an assembly of the Scionaeans, he repeated what he had said at Acanthus and Torone.


4.120.3
3293
σημεῖόν τ’ εἶναι τοῦ καὶ ἄλλο τι ἂν αὐτοὺς τῶν μεγίστων ἀνδρείως ὑπομεῖναι ·
And he said they were most deserving of praise, inasmuch as, though Pallene within the isthmus was cut off from succors by land through the Athenians occupying Potidaea, and they were virtually nothing else but islanders, they had of their own accord joined the banner of liberty.


4.120.3
3294
εἴ τε θήσεται κατὰ νοῦν τὰ πράγματα , πιστοτάτους τε τῇ ἀληθείᾳ ἡγήσεσθαι αὐτοὺς Λακεδαιμονίων φίλους καὶ τ- ἄλλα τιμήσειν .
And he said that this was a proof that they would also endure like men any other even of the greatest perils if their affairs should be arranged to their satisfaction; in short, that he should consider them as truly the most faithful allies of the Lacedaemonians, and show them all other proofs of his respect.


4.121.1
3295
καὶ οἱ μὲν Σκιωναῖοι ἐπήρθησάν τε τοῖς λόγοις καὶ θαρσήσαντες πάντες ὁμοίως , καὶ οἷς πρότερον μὴ ἤρεσκε τὰ πρασσόμενα , τόν τε πόλεμον διενοοῦντο προθύμως οἴσειν καὶ τὸν Βρασίδαν τά τ’ ἄλλα καλῶς ἐδέξαντο καὶ δημοσίᾳ μὲν χρυσῷ στεφάνῳ ἀνέδησαν ὡς ἐλευθεροῦντα τὴν Ἑλλάδα , ἰδίᾳ δὲ ἐταινίουν τε καὶ προσήρχοντο ὥσπερ ἀθλητῇ .
The Scionaeans were elated by his language, and all alike taking courage, even those who before were not pleased with the business, resolved to carry on the war with spirit; and both received Brasidas with other marks of honour, and publicly crowned him with a crown of gold, as the liberator of Greece; while individually they decked him with garlands, and thronged to him as to a victorious athlete.


4.121.2
3296
ὁ δὲ τό τε παραυτίκα φυλακήν τινα αὐτοῖς ἐγκαταλιπὼν διέβη πάλιν καὶ ὕστερον οὐ πολλῷ στρατιὰν πλείω ἐπεραίωσε , βουλόμενος μετ’ αὐτῶν τῆς τε Μένδης καὶ τῆς Ποτειδαίας ἀποπειρᾶσαι , ἡγούμενος καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους βοηθῆσαι ἂν ὡς ἐς νῆσον καὶ βουλόμενος φθάσαι ·
At that time, after leaving them some guards, he crossed over again, and not long after sent them over a larger force; as he wished, in conjunction with them, to make an attempt on Mende and Potidaea, thinking that the Athenians would come to their relief, as though it were an island, and desiring to be beforehand with them.


4.121.2
3297
καί τι αὐτῷ καὶ ἐπράσσετο ἐς τὰς πόλεις ταύτας προδοσίας πέρι .
He was carrying on also some communications with those towns, with a view to their being betrayed to him.


4.122.1
3298
καὶ ὁ μὲν ἔμελλεν ἐγχειρήσειν ταῖς πόλεσι ταύταις , ἐν τούτῳ δὲ τριήρει οἱ τὴν ἐκεχειρίαν περιαγγέλλοντες ἀφικνοῦνται παρ’ αὐτόν , Ἀθηναίων μὲν Ἀριστώνυμος , Λακεδαιμονίων δὲ Ἀθήναιος .
But in the mean time there came to him in a trireme the commissioners, who were carrying round intelligence of the armistice, Aristonymus on the side of the Athenian s, and Athenians on that of the Lacedaemonians.


4.122.2
3299
καὶ ἡ μὲν στρατιὰ πάλιν διέβη ἐς Τορώνην , οἱ δὲ τῷ Βρασίδᾳ ἀνήγγελλον τὴν ξυνθήκην , καὶ ἐδέξαντο πάντες οἱ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ξύμμαχοι Λακεδαιμονίων τὰ πεπραγμένα .
So the troops crossed over again to Torone; while they informed Brasidas of the truce, and all the allies of the Lacedaemonians Thrace-ward assented to what had been done. Now Aristonymus allowed all the other cases;


4.122.3
3300
Ἀριστώνυμος δὲ τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις κατῄνει , Σκιωναίους δὲ αἰσθόμενος ἐκ λογισμοῦ τῶν ἡμερῶν ὅτι ὕστερον ἀφεστήκοιεν , οὐκ ἔφη ἐνσπόνδους ἔσεσθαι .
Aristonymus, however, on a calculation of the days, found that the Scionaeans had revolted after the date of the convention, and said that they would not be included in it.


4.122.3
3301
Βρασίδας δὲ ἀντέλεγε πολλά , ὡς πρότερον , καὶ οὐκ ἀφίει τὴν πόλιν .
But Brasidas earnestly contended, on the other hand, that they had revolted before the truce was made, and refused to give the town up.


4.122.4
3302
ὡς δ’ ἀπήγγελλεν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ὁ Ἀριστώνυμος περὶ αὐτῶν , οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι εὐθὺς ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν στρατεύειν ἐπὶ τὴν Σκιώνην .
When Aristonymus reported their case at Athens, the people were immediately prepared to send an expedition against Scione.


4.122.4
3303
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι πρέσβεις πέμψαντες παραβήσεσθαι ἔφασαν αὐτοὺς τὰς σπονδάς , καὶ τῆς πόλεως ἀντεποιοῦντο Βρασίδᾳ πιστεύοντες , δίκῃ τε ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν περὶ αὐτῆς κρίνεσθαι .
But the Lacedaemonians sent envoys and told them that they would be violating the truce; and laid claim to the town, in reliance on the statement of Brasidas; offering, at the same time, to let the question be decided by arbitration.


4.122.5
3304
οἱ δὲ δίκῃ μὲν οὐκ ἤθελον κινδυνεύειν , στρατεύειν δὲ ὡς τάχιστα , ὀργὴν ποιούμενοι εἰ καὶ οἱ ἐν ταῖς νήσοις ἤδη ὄντες ἀξιοῦσι σφῶν ἀφίστασθαι , τῇ κατὰ γῆν Λακεδαιμονίων ἰσχύι ἀνωφελεῖ πιστεύοντες .
The Athenians, however, did not wish to run the risk of arbitration, but to send the expedition as quickly as possible; being enraged to think that even the inhabitants of the islands now presumed to revolt from them, trusting in the power of the Lacedaemonians by land, which could not help them.


4.122.6
3305
εἶχε δὲ καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια περὶ τῆς ἀποστάσεως μᾶλλον ᾗ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐδικαίουν ·
And indeed the truth of the question respecting the revolt was rather as the Athenians maintained.


4.122.6
3306
δύο γὰρ ἡμέραις ὕστερον ἀπέστησαν οἱ Σκιωναῖοι .
For the Scionaeans revolted two days after the truce was signed.


4.122.6
3307
ψήφισμά τ’ εὐθὺς ἐποιήσαντο , Κλέωνος γνώμῃ πεισθέντες , Σκιωναίους ἐξελεῖν τε καὶ ἀποκτεῖναι .
Accordingly, at the instigation of Cleon, they at once passed a decree that they should reduce the Scionaeans, and put them to death.


4.122.6
3308
καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἡσυχάζοντες ἐς τοῦτο παρεσκευάζοντο .
So, while they remained quiet from other undertakings, they were engaged in preparing for this.


4.123.1
3309
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ Μένδη ἀφίσταται αὐτῶν , πόλις ἐν τῇ Παλλήνῃ , Ἐρετριῶν ἀποικία .
In the meantime, Mende revolted from them, a town in Pallene, and a colony of the Eretrians.


4.123.1
3310
καὶ αὐτοὺς ἐδέξατο ὁ Βρασίδας , οὐ νομίζων ἀδικεῖν , ὅτι ἐν τῇ ἐκεχειρίᾳ φανερῶς προσεχώρησαν ·
Brasidas received them, not thinking that he was doing wrong, because they had clearly come over to him during the armistice.


4.123.1
3311
ἔστι γὰρ ἃ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνεκάλει τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις παραβαίνειν τὰς σπονδάς .
For in some points he himself also charged the Athenians with infringing the truce.


4.123.2
3312
δι’ ὃ καὶ οἱ Μενδαῖοι μᾶλλον ἐτόλμησαν , τήν τε τοῦ Βρασίδου γνώμην ὁρῶντες ἑτοίμην , τεκμαιρόμενοι καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Σκιώνης ὅτι οὐ προυδίδου , καὶ ἅμα τῶν πρασσόντων σφίσιν ὀλίγων τε ὄντων καὶ ὡς τότε ἐμέλλησαν οὐκέτι ἀνέντων , ἀλλὰ περὶ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς φοβουμένων τὸ κατάδηλον καὶ καταβιασαμένων παρὰ γνώμην τοὺς πολλούς .
And for this reason the Mendaeans were the more emboldened, seeing the feelings of Brasidas warmly disposed towards them, and inferring as much from the case of Scione, since he would not give it up; and at the same time because those of them who contrived the revolt were a small party, and since thinking of it on that occasion, had never let it rest afterwards, but were afraid of conviction for themselves, and forced the majority to it against their inclination.


4.123.3
3313
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι εὐθὺς πυθόμενοι , πολλῷ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὀργισθέντες παρεσκευάζοντο ἐπ’ ἀμφοτέρας τὰς πόλεις .
The Athenians, immediately hearing of it, were still far more enraged, and made their preparations against both the towns.


4.123.4
3314
καὶ Βρασίδας προσδεχόμενος τὸν ἐπίπλουν αὐτῶν ὑπεκκομίζει ἐς Ὄλυνθον τὴν Χαλκιδικὴν παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας τῶν Σκιωναίων καὶ Μενδαίων , καὶ τῶν Πελοποννησίων αὐτοῖς πεντακοσίους ὁπλίτας διέπεμψε καὶ πελταστὰς τριακοσίους Χαλκιδέων , ἄρχοντά τε τῶν ἁπάντων Πολυδαμίδαν .
Brasidas, expecting their attack, conveyed away to Olynthus in Chalcidice the women and children of the Scionaeans and Mendaeans, and sent over to them five hundred Peloponnesian heavy-armed and three hundred Chalcidian targeteers, with Polydamidas in command of them all.


4.123.4
3315
καὶ οἱ μὲν τὰ περὶ σφᾶς αὐτούς , ὡς ἐν τάχει παρεσομένων τῶν Ἀθηναίων , κοινῇ ηὐτρεπίζοντο .
And so they joined in making their preparations, believing that the Athenians would quickly be with them.


4.124.1
3316
Βρασίδας δὲ καὶ Περδίκκας ἐν τούτῳ στρατεύουσιν ἅμα ἐπὶ Ἀρραβαῖον τὸ δεύτερον ἐς Λύγκον .
Brasidas and Perdiccas meanwhile made an expedition together the second time into Lyncus, against Arrhibaeus.


4.124.1
3317
καὶ ἦγον ὁ μὲν ὧν ἐκράτει Μακεδόνων τὴν δύναμιν καὶ τῶν ἐνοικούντων Ἑλλήνων ὁπλίτας , ὁ δὲ πρὸς τοῖς αὐτοῦ περιλοίποις τῶν Πελοποννησίων Χαλκιδέας καὶ Ἀκανθίους καὶ τῶν ἄλλων κατὰ δύναμιν ἑκάστων .
Perdiccas brought the forces of the Macedonians under his dominion, and some heavy-armed troops of the Greeks living amongst them; Brasidas, in addition to those of the Peloponnesians whom he had still left, brought the Chalcidians, Acanthians, and others according to their respective strength.


4.124.1
3318
ξύμπαν δὲ τὸ ὁπλιτικὸν τῶν Ἑλλήνων τρισχίλιοι μάλιστα , ἱππῆς δ’ οἱ πάντες ἠκολούθουν Μακεδόνων ξὺν Χαλκιδεῦσιν ὀλίγου ἐς χιλίους , καὶ ἄλλος ὅμιλος τῶν βαρβάρων πολύς .
In all, the heavy-armed Greeks amounted to about three thousand; all the cavalry of the Macedonians with the Chalcidians went with them, amounting to nearly a thousand, and a large multitude of the barbarians besides.


4.124.2
3319
ἐσβαλόντες δὲ ἐς τὴν Ἀρραβαίου καὶ εὑρόντες ἀντεστρατοπεδευμένους αὑτοῖς τοὺς Λυγκηστὰς ἀντεκαθέζοντο καὶ αὐτοί .
invaded the country of Arrhibaeus, and finding the Lyncestians encamped in the field against them, they also took up a position opposite to them.


4.124.3
3320
καὶ ἐχόντων τῶν μὲν πεζῶν λόφον ἑκατέρωθεν , πεδίου δὲ τοῦ μέσου ὄντος , οἱ ἱππῆς ἐς αὐτὸ καταδραμόντες ἱππομάχησαν πρῶτα ἀμφοτέρων , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ ὁ Βρασίδας καὶ ὁ Περδίκκας , προελθόντων προτέρων ἀπὸ τοῦ λόφου μετὰ τῶν ἱππέων τῶν Λυγκηστῶν ὁπλιτῶν καὶ ἑτοίμων ὄντων μάχεσθαι , ἀντεπαγαγόντες καὶ αὐτοὶ ξυνέβαλον καὶ ἔτρεψαν τοὺς Λυγκηστάς , καὶ πολλοὺς μὲν διέφθειραν , οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ διαφυγόντες πρὸς τὰ μετέωρα ἡσύχαζον .
The infantry occupying a hill on each side, and the space between being a plain, the horse of both armies, in the first place, galloped down into it, and engaged in a cavalry action. Then the Lyncestian heavy-armed having advanced first from their hill with their cavalry, and being ready for action, Brasidas and Perdiccas also, in their turn, led their forces against them, and engaged in battle, and routed the Lyncestians, and killed many of them; but the rest took refuge on the heights, and there remained quiet.


4.124.4
3321
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο τροπαῖον στήσαντες δύο μὲν ἢ τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἐπέσχον , τοὺς Ἰλλυριοὺς μένοντες , οἳ ἔτυχον τῷ Περδίκκᾳ μισθοῦ μέλλοντες ἥξειν ·
After this, having erected a trophy, they waited two or three days, in expectation of the Illyrians, who were to join Perdiccas as mercenaries.


4.124.4
3322
ἔπειτα ὁ Περδίκκας ἐβούλετο προϊέναι ἐπὶ τὰς τοῦ Ἀρραβαίου κώμας καὶ μὴ καθῆσθαι , Βρασίδας δὲ τῆς τε Μένδης περιορώμενος , μὴ τῶν Ἀθηναίων πρότερον ἐπιπλευσάντων τι πάθῃ , καὶ ἅμα τῶν Ἰλλυριῶν οὐ παρόντων , οὐ πρόθυμος ἦν , ἀλλὰ ἀναχωρεῖν μᾶλλον .
Then Perdiccas wished to advance against the villages of Arrhibaeus, and not to sit still; but Brasidas was anxious for Mende, lest if the Athenians should sail against it before his return, it should meet with some disaster; and, as the Illyrians, moreover, had not joined them, he was not eager to advance, but rather to retreat.


4.125.1
3323
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ διαφερομένων αὐτῶν ἠγγέλθη ὅτι οἱ Ἰλλυριοὶ μετ’ Ἀρραβαίου προδόντες Περδίκκαν γεγένηνται ·
In the meantime, while they were thus at variance, news arrived that the Illyrians had actually betrayed Perdiccas, and joined Arrhibaeus.


4.125.1
3324
ὥστε ἤδη ἀμφοτέροις μὲν δοκοῦν ἀναχωρεῖν διὰ τὸ δέος αὐτῶν ὄντων ἀνθρώπων μαχίμων , κυρωθὲν δὲ οὐδὲν ἐκ τῆς διαφορᾶς ὁπηνίκα χρὴ ὁρμᾶσθαι , νυκτός τε ἐπιγενομένης , οἱ μὲν Μακεδόνες καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν βαρβάρων εὐθὺς φοβηθέντες , ὅπερ φιλεῖ μεγάλα στρατόπεδα ἀσαφῶς ἐκπλήγνυσθαι , καὶ νομίσαντες πολλαπλασίους μὲν ἢ ἦλθον ἐπιέναι , ὅσον δὲ οὔπω παρεῖναι , καταστάντες ἐς αἰφνίδιον φυγὴν ἐχώρουν ἐπ’ οἴκου , καὶ τὸν Περδίκκαν τὸ πρῶτον οὐκ αἰσθανόμενον , ὡς ἔγνω , ἠνάγκασαν πρὶν τὸν Βρασίδαν ἰδεῖν ( ἄπωθεν γὰρ πολὺ ἀλλήλων ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο ) προαπελθεῖν .
So that now both parties thought it best to retreat through their fear of them, as they were men of a warlike character; but nothing being settled, in consequence of their quarrel, as to when they should march, and night coming on, the Macedonians and the multitude of the barbarians were immediately terrified, (as great armies are wont to be panic-stricken for no certain cause;) and thinking that many times more than had really come were advancing against them, and had all but reached them, they broke into sudden flight, and proceeded homeward. Perdiccas, who at first was not aware of it, was compelled by them, on his learning it, to depart before seeing Brasidas (for they were encamped at a great distance from each other).


4.125.2
3325
Βρασίδας δὲ ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ ὡς εἶδε τοὺς Μακεδόνας προκεχωρηκότας τούς τε Ἰλλυριοὺς καὶ τὸν Ἀρραβαῖον μέλλοντας ἐπιέναι , ξυναγαγὼν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐς τετράγωνον τάξιν τοὺς ὁπλίτας καὶ τὸν ψιλὸν ὅμιλον ἐς μέσον λαβὼν διενοεῖτο ἀναχωρεῖν .
In the morning, when Brasidas saw that the Macedonians had gone before him, and that the Illyrians and Arrhibaeus were on the point of attacking him, he, on his side, drew his heavy-armed together into a square, and taking the light-armed multitude into the centre, intended to retire. And he appointed his youngest men to dash out, on whatever point they might charge them;


4.125.3
3326
ἐκδρόμους δέ , εἴ πῃ προσβάλλοιεν αὐτοῖς , ἔταξε τοὺς νεωτάτους , καὶ αὐτὸς λογάδας ἔχων τριακοσίους τελευταῖος γνώμην εἶχεν ὑποχωρῶν τοῖς τῶν ἐναντίων πρώτοις προσκεισομένοις ἀνθιστάμενος ἀμύνεσθαι .
while he himself with three hundred picked men in the rear intended during the retreat to face about, and resist the first of the enemy that should fall upon them.


4.125.4
3327
καὶ πρὶν τοὺς πολεμίους ἐγγὺς εἶναι , ὡς διὰ ταχέων παρεκελεύσατο τοῖς στρατιώταις τοιάδε .
Before the enemy came near, he addressed his men, as well as the short time allowed him, with the following exhortation:


4.126.1
3328
&quot; εἰ μὲν μὴ ὑπώπτευον , ἄνδρες Πελοποννήσιοι , ὑμᾶς τῷ τε μεμονῶσθαι καὶ ὅτι βάρβαροι οἱ ἐπιόντες καὶ πολλοὶ ἔκπληξιν ἔχειν , οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως διδαχὴν ἅμα τῇ παρακελεύσει ἐποιούμην ·
"Men of the Peloponnese, if I did not suspect that in consequence of your being left alone, and because your assailants are barbarians, and there are many of them, you were thrown into consternation, I should not have given you, as I do, information at the same time as encouragement.


4.126.1
3329
νῦν δὲ πρὸς μὲν τὴν ἀπόλειψιν τῶν ἡμετέρων καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἐναντίων βραχεῖ ὑπομνήματι καὶ παραινέσει τὰ μέγιστα πειράσομαι πείθειν .
But as it is, with respect to the desertion of our friends, and the superior numbers of our adversaries, I will endeavour, by a brief admonition and advice, to convince you of what is most important for you."


4.126.2
3330
ἀγαθοῖς γὰρ εἶναι ὑμῖν προσήκει τὰ πολέμια οὐ διὰ ξυμμάχων παρουσίαν ἑκάστοτε , ἀλλὰ δι’ οἰκείαν ἀρετήν , καὶ μηδὲν πλῆθος πεφοβῆσθαι ἑτέρων , οἵ γε μηδὲ ἀπὸ πολιτειῶν τοιούτων ἥκετε , ἐν αἷς οὐ πολλοὶ ὀλίγων ἄρχουσιν , ἀλλὰ πλεόνων μᾶλλον ἐλάσσους , οὐκ ἄλλῳ τινὶ κτησάμενοι τὴν δυναστείαν ἢ τῷ μαχόμενοι κρατεῖν .
" For it is your proper characterr to be brave in warlike operations, not from the presence of allies in each case, but from your own native valour; and to fear no number of your enemies whatever: since neither are the governments from which you come of such a character—governments in which the many do not rule the few, but rather the smaller number the greater, having acquired their power by no other means than by being victorious in battle."


4.126.3
3331
βαρβάρους δὲ οὓς νῦν ἀπειρίᾳ δέδιτε μαθεῖν χρή , ἐξ ὧν τε προηγώνισθε τοῖς Μακεδόσιν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀφ’ ὧν ἐγὼ εἰκάζω τε καὶ ἄλλων ἀκοῇ ἐπίσταμαι , οὐ δεινοὺς ἐσομένους .
" But with regard to barbarians, of whom you are now afraid through inexperience, you ought to know, both from the contest you have already had with those of them who are Macedonians, and from what I myself conjecture, and indeed have ascertained from hearsay, that they will not prove formidable."


4.126.4
3332
καὶ γὰρ ὅσα μὲν τῷ ὄντι ἀσθενῆ ὄντα τῶν πολεμίων δόκησιν ἔχει ἰσχύος , διδαχὴ ἀληθὴς προσγενομένη περὶ αὐτῶν ἐθάρσυνε μᾶλλον τοὺς ἀμυνομένους ·
"For with regard to such points in an enemy as have an appearance of strength, while they are in reality weak, when correct information is gained respecting them, it rather gives confidence to those who resist them:


4.126.4
3333
οἷς δὲ βεβαίως τι πρόσεστιν ἀγαθόν , μὴ προειδώς τις ἂν αὐτοῖς τολμηρότερον προσφέροιτο .
whereas in the case of those who have any solid advantage, men would meet them the more boldly from having no previous acquaintance with them."


4.126.5
3334
οὗτοι δὲ τὴν μέλλησιν μὲν ἔχουσι τοῖς ἀπείροις φοβεράν ·
"Now these men present indeed a demonstration fearful to such as are unacquainted with them:


4.126.5
3335
καὶ γὰρ πλήθει ὄψεως δεινοὶ καὶ βοῆς μεγέθει ἀφόρητοι , ἥ τε διὰ κενῆς ἐπανάσεισις τῶν ὅπλων ἔχει τινὰ δήλωσιν ἀπειλῆς .
for they are formidable in their numbers which meet the eye, and intolerable from the loudness of their shouting; and the brandishing of their weapons in the air has a look of threatening.


4.126.5
3336
προσμεῖξαι δὲ τοῖς ὑπομένουσιν αὐτὰ οὐχ ὁμοῖοι ·
But to those who stand their ground against them, they are not what they seemed;


4.126.5
3337
οὔτε γὰρ τάξιν ἔχοντες αἰσχυνθεῖεν ἂν λιπεῖν τινὰ χώραν βιαζόμενοι ἥ τε φυγὴ καὶ ἡ ἔφοδος αὐτῶν ἴσην ἔχουσα δόξαν τοῦ καλοῦ ἀνεξέλεγκτον καὶ τὸ ἀνδρεῖον ἔχει ( αὐτοκράτωρ δὲ μάχη μάλιστ’ ἂν καὶ πρόφασιν τοῦ σῴζεσθαί τινι πρεπόντως πορίσειε ) , τοῦ τε ἐς χεῖρας ἐλθεῖν πιστότερον τὸ ἐκφοβῆσαι ὑμᾶς ἀκινδύνως ἡγοῦνται ·
for they have no definite order, so as to be ashamed of leaving any particular position, when hard pressed; and their retreat and attack being considered equally honourable puts their courage also beyond the reach of proof; while their independent mode of fighting would most frequently afford a man a pretext for saving himself with a fair show. And so they consider the probability of their frightening you without any danger to themselves a surer game than meeting you hand to hand;


4.126.5
3338
ἐκείνῳ γὰρ ἂν πρὸ τούτου ἐχρῶντο .
else they would have adopted that method instead of their present one."


4.126.6
3339
σαφῶς τε πᾶν τὸ προϋπάρχον δεινὸν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁρᾶτε ἔργῳ μὲν βραχὺ ὄν , ὄψει δὲ καὶ ἀκοῇ κατασπέρχον .
"And in this way you clearly see, that all that was previously terrible in them, is but little in reality, though to the eye and to the ear very urgent.


4.126.6
3340
ὃ ὑπομείναντες ἐπιφερόμενον καί , ὅταν καιρὸς ᾖ , κόσμῳ καὶ τάξει αὖθις ὑπαγαγόντες , ἔς τε τὸ ἀσφαλὲς θᾶσσον ἀφίζεσθε καὶ γνώσεσθε τὸ λοιπὸν ὅτι οἱ τοιοῦτοι ὄχλοι τοῖς μὲν τὴν πρώτην ἔφοδον δεξαμένοις ἄπωθεν ἀπειλαῖς τὸ ἀνδρεῖον μελλήσει ἐπικομποῦσιν , οἳ δ’ ἂν εἴξωσιν αὐτοῖς , κατὰ πόδας τὸ εὔψυχον ἐν τῷ ἀσφαλεῖ ὀξεῖς ἐνδείκνυνται &quot; .
If, therefore, you stand firm against its approach, and when you have an opportunity, again retire in good order, and in your ranks, you will the sooner reach a place of safety; and will know in future, that to those who sustain their first attack, such rabbles only make a vaunting demonstration, by threatening at a distance; but in the case of those who yield to them, they are quick in displaying their courage in pursuit, when they can do it with security."


4.127.1
3341
τοιαῦτα ὁ Βρασίδας παραινέσας ὑπῆγε τὸ στράτευμα .
In this way did Brasidas exhort them, and began to lead off his forces.


4.127.1
3342
οἱ δὲ βάρβαροι ἰδόντες πολλῇ βοῇ καὶ θορύβῳ προσέκειντο , νομίσαντες φεύγειν τε αὐτὸν καὶ καταλαβόντες διαφθερεῖν .
When the barbarians saw it, they pressed on him with much shouting and uproar, thinking that he was flying, and being determined to overtake and cut him off.


4.127.2
3343
καὶ ὡς αὐτοῖς αἵ τε ἐκδρομαὶ ὅπῃ προσπίπτοιεν ἀπήντων καὶ αὐτὸς ἔχων τοὺς λογάδας ἐπικειμένους ὑφίστατο , τῇ τε πρώτῃ ὁρμῇ παρὰ γνώμην ἀντέστησαν καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ἐπιφερομένους μὲν δεχόμενοι ἠμύνοντο , ἡσυχαζόντων δὲ αὐτοὶ ὑπεχώρουν , τότε δὴ τῶν μετὰ τοῦ Βρασίδου Ἑλλήνων ἐν τῇ εὐρυχωρίᾳ οἱ πολλοὶ τῶν βαρβάρων ἀπέσχοντο , μέρος δέ τι καταλιπόντες αὐτοῖς ἐπακολουθοῦν προσβάλλειν , οἱ λοιποὶ χωρήσαντες δρόμῳ ἐπί τε τοὺς φεύγοντας τῶν Μακεδόνων οἷς ἐντύχοιεν ἔκτεινον καὶ τὴν ἐσβολήν , ἥ ἐστι μεταξὺ δυοῖν λόφοιν στενὴ ἐς τὴν Ἀρραβαίου , φθάσαντες προκατέλαβον , εἰδότες οὐκ οὖσαν ἄλλην τῷ Βρασίδᾳ ἀναχώρησιν .
Then, when the reserve companies met them, at whatever point they charged; and Brasidas himself with his picked men withstood the pressure, and they had, contrary to their expectation, resisted their first rush, and, after that, received and repelled them when they came on, but retired themselves, when the enemy withdrew:


4.127.2
3344
καὶ προσιόντος αὐτοῦ ἐς αὐτὸ ἤδη τὸ ἄπορον τῆς ὁδοῦ κυκλοῦνται ὡς ἀποληψόμενοι .
then indeed the main body of the barbarians ceased attacking the Greeks with Brasidas in the open country; and having left a portion of their forces to follow and harass them, the rest advanced at a run against the flying Macedonians, cutting down such as they fell in with; and got in time to preoccupy the narrow pass which runs between two hills, into the country of Arrhibaeus, knowing that there was no other way of retreat for Brasidas. And when he was coming to just where the road now became impassable, they proceeded to surround him, with a view to cutting him off.


4.128.1
3345
ὁ δὲ γνοὺς προεῖπε τοῖς μεθ’ αὑτοῦ τριακοσίοις , ὃν ᾤετο μᾶλλον ἂν ἑλεῖν τῶν λόφων , χωρήσαντας πρὸς αὐτὸν δρόμῳ , ὡς τάχιστα ἕκαστος δύναται , ἄνευ τάξεως , πειρᾶσαι ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐκκροῦσαι τοὺς ἤδη ἐπόντας βαρβάρους , πρὶν καὶ τὴν πλέονα κύκλωσιν σφῶν αὐτόσε προσμεῖξαι .
He, on perceiving it, gave orders to his band of three hundred to advance at a run to that one of the hills which he thought they might take more easily, as quickly as each man could, without observing any order; and to endeavour to dislodge from it the barbarians who were already upon it, before their main force that was surrounding him should join them there.


4.128.2
3346
καὶ οἱ μὲν προσπεσόντες ἐκράτησάν τε τῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ λόφου , καὶ ἡ πλείων ἤδη στρατιὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ῥᾷον πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπορεύοντο ·
Accordingly, they charged, and overpowered the party on the hill, and the main force of the Greeks now advanced more easily up to it;


4.128.2
3347
οἱ γὰρ βάρβαροι καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν , τῆς τροπῆς αὐτοῖς ἐνταῦθα γενομένης σφῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ μετεώρου ,καὶ ἐς τὸ πλέον οὐκέτ’ ἐπηκολούθουν , νομίζοντες καὶ ἐν μεθορίοις εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἤδη καὶ διαπεφευγέναι .
for the barbarians were frightened on finding their men on that side dislodged from the height, and no longer followed the main body, considering that they were now on the borders, and had escaped them.


4.128.3
3348
Βρασίδας δὲ ὡς ἀντελάβετο τῶν μετεώρων , κατὰ ἀσφάλειαν μᾶλλον ἰὼν αὐθημερὸν ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Ἄρνισαν πρῶτον τῆς Περδίκκου ἀρχῆς .
When Brasidas had thus reached the heights, he proceeded with greater safety, and arrived the same day at Arnissa, the first town in the dominions of Perdiccas.


4.128.4
3349
καὶ αὐτοὶ ὀργιζόμενοι οἱ στρατιῶται τῇ προαναχωρήσει τῶν Μακεδόνων , ὅσοις ἐνέτυχον κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ζεύγεσιν αὐτῶν βοεικοῖς ἢ εἴ τινι σκεύει ἐκπεπτωκότι , οἷα ἐν νυκτερινῇ καὶ φοβερᾷ ἀναχωρήσει εἰκὸς ἦν ξυμβῆναι , τὰ μὲν ὑπολύοντες κατέκοπτον , τῶν δὲ οἰκείωσιν ἐποιοῦντο .
And as the soldiers were enraged at the Macedonians' having retreated before them, whatever yokes of oxen belonging to them they fell in with on the road, or whatever baggage that had dropped off, (as was likely to happen in case of a retreat by night, and under an alarm,) on their own authority they unyoked and cut down the cattle, and appropriated the baggage.


4.128.5
3350
ἀπὸ τούτου τε πρῶτον Περδίκκας Βρασίδαν τε πολέμιον ἐνόμισε καὶ ἐς τὸ λοιπὸν Πελοποννησίων τῇ μὲν γνώμῃ δι’ Ἀθηναίους οὐ ξύνηθες μῖσος εἶχε , τῶν δὲ ἀναγκαίων ξυμφόρων διαναστὰς ἔπρασσεν ὅτῳ τρόπῳ τάχιστα τοῖς μὲν ξυμβήσεται , τῶν δὲ ἀπαλλάξεται .
From this time Perdiccas first regarded Brasidas as an enemy, and cherished in future a hatred of the Lacedaemonians, which was not, indeed congenial with his feelings, because of his aversion for the Athenians; but he departed from his natural interests, and was contriving in what way he might soonest come to terms with the Athenians, and be rid of the Peloponnesians.


4.129.1
3351
Βρασίδας δὲ ἀναχωρήσας ἐκ Μακεδονίας ἐς Τορώνην καταλαμβάνει Ἀθηναίους Μένδην ἤδη ἔχοντας , καὶ αὐτοῦ ἡσυχάζων ἐς μὲν τὴν Παλλήνην ἀδύνατος ἤδη ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι διαβὰς τιμωρεῖν , τὴν δὲ Τορώνην ἐν φυλακῇ εἶχεν .
On his return from Macedonia, Brasidas found the Athenians already in possession of Mende; and remaining quiet there, though he considered himself unable to cross over into Pallene, and assist it, he kept watch over Torone.


4.129.2
3352
ὑπὸ γὰρ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον τοῖς ἐν τῇ Λύγκῳ ἐξέπλευσαν ἐπί τε τὴν Μένδην καὶ τὴν Σκιώνην οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὥσπερ παρεσκευάζοντο , ναυσὶ μὲν πεντήκοντα , ὧν ἦσαν δέκα Χῖαι , ὁπλίταις δὲ χιλίοις ἑαυτῶν καὶ τοξόταις ἑξακοσίοις καὶ Θρᾳξὶ μισθωτοῖς χιλίοις καὶ ἄλλοις τῶν αὐτόθεν ξυμμάχων πελτασταῖς ·
For about the same time as the campaign in Lyncus, the Athenians sent the expedition against Mende and Scione, as they were preparing to do, with fifty ships, ten of which were Chians, and one thousand heavy-armed of their own, six hundred bowmen, one thousand Thracian mercenaries, and others of their allies from that country serving as targeteers.


4.129.2
3353
ἐστρατήγει δὲ Νικίας ὁ Νικηράτου καὶ Νικόστρατος ὁ Διειτρέφους .
Nicias son of Niceratus, and Nicostratus son of Diitrephes were in command.


4.129.3
3354
ἄραντες δὲ ἐκ Ποτειδαίας ταῖς ναυσὶ καὶ σχόντες κατὰ τὸ Ποσειδώνιον ἐχώρουν ἐς τοὺς Μενδαίους .
After advancing from Potidaea with their ships, they came to land opposite the temple of Neptune, and proceeded against the Mendaeans.


4.129.3
3355
οἱ δὲ αὐτοί τε καὶ Σκιωναίων τριακόσιοι βεβοηθηκότες Πελοποννησίων τε οἱ ἐπίκουροι , ξύμπαντες δὲ ἑπτακόσιοι ὁπλῖται , καὶ Πολυδαμίδας ὁ ἄρχων αὐτῶν , ἔτυχον ἐξεστρατοπεδευμένοι ἔξω τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ λόφου καρτεροῦ .
They, both themselves and three hundred Scionaeans who had come to their aid, and the Peloponnesian auxiliaries, seven hundred heavy-armed in all, with Polydamidas their commander, were encamped outside the city on a strong hill.


4.129.4
3356
καὶ αὐτοῖς Νικίας μὲν Μεθωναίους τε ἔχων εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν ψιλοὺς καὶ λογάδας τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὁπλιτῶν ἑξήκοντα καὶ τοὺς τοξότας ἅπαντας κατὰ ἀτραπόν τινα τοῦ λόφου πειρώμενος προσβῆναι καὶ τραυματιζόμενος ὑπ’ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐδυνήθη βιάσασθαι ·
Nicias, with one hundred and twenty Methonaean light-armed, sixty picked men of the Athenian heavy-armed, and all the bowmen, attempted to come at them by a path running up the hill; but being wounded by them, was unable to force their position:


4.129.4
3357
Νικόστρατος δὲ ἄλλῃ ἐφόδῳ ἐκ πλέονος παντὶ τῷ ἄλλῳ στρατοπέδῳ ἐπιὼν τῷ λόφῳ ὄντι δυσπροσβάτῳ καὶ πάνυ ἐθορυβήθη , καὶ ἐς ὀλίγον ἀφίκετο πᾶν τὸ στράτευμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων νικηθῆναι .
while Nicostratus, with all the rest of the army, advancing by a different approach, and from a more distant point, against the hill, which was difficult of access, was beaten back in utter confusion, and the whole force of the Athenians was within a little of being defeated.


4.129.5
3358
καὶ ταύτῃ μὲν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ , ὡς οὐκ ἐνέδοσαν οἱ Μενδαῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι , οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀναχωρήσαντες ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο , καὶ οἱ Μενδαῖοι νυκτὸς ἐπελθούσης ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἀπῆλθον .
conquered. For that day, then, as the Mendaeans and their allies did not give way, the Athenians retreated and pitched their camp; and the Mendaeans, when night came on, returned into the town.


4.130.1
3359
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι περιπλεύσαντες ἐς τὸ πρὸς Σκιώνης τό τε προάστειον εἷλον καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν ἅπασαν ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν οὐδενὸς ἐπεξιόντος ( ἦν γάρ τι καὶ στασιασμοῦ ἐν τῇ πόλει ) , οἱ δὲ τριακόσιοι τῶν Σκιωναίων τῆς ἐπιούσης νυκτὸς ἀπεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The day following, the Athenians sailed round to the side towards Scione, and took the suburb, and ravaged the land the whole day, no one coming out against them. For indeed there was some opposition of parties in the town; and the three hundred of the Scionaeans, on the approach of night, returned home.


4.130.2
3360
καὶ τῇ ἐπιγιγνομένῃ ἡμέρᾳ Νικίας μὲν τῷ ἡμίσει τοῦ στρατοῦ προϊὼν ἅμα ἐς τὰ μεθόρια τῶν Σκιωναίων τὴν γῆν ἐδῄου , Νικόστρατος δὲ τοῖς λοιποῖς κατὰ τὰς ἄνω πύλας , ᾗ ἐπὶ Ποτειδαίας ἔρχονται , προσεκάθητο τῇ πόλει .
The next day Nicias advanced with half the forces to the borders of the Scionaeans, and laid waste the land, while Nicostratus with the remainder sat down before the town, near the upper gates, by the way they go to Potidaea.


4.130.3
3361
ὁ δὲ Πολυδαμίδας ( ἔτυχε γὰρ ταύτῃ τοῖς Μενδαίοις καὶ ἐπικούροις ἐντὸς τοῦ τείχους τὰ ὅπλα κείμενα ) διατάσσει τε ὡς ἐς μάχην καὶ παρῄνει τοῖς Μενδαίοις ἐπεξιέναι .
There Polydamidas (as the arms of the Mendaeans and their auxiliaries happened to be piled in that quarter) began to draw them up for battle, and exhorted the Mendaeans to march out against the enemy.


4.130.4
3362
καί τινος αὐτῷ τῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ δήμου ἀντειπόντος κατὰ τὸ στασιωτικὸν ὅτι οὐκ ἐπέξεισιν οὐδὲ δέοιτο πολεμεῖν , καὶ ὡς ἀντεῖπεν ἐπισπασθέντος τε τῇ χειρὶ ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ θορυβηθέντος , ὁ δῆμος εὐθὺς ἀναλαβὼν τὰ ὅπλα περιοργὴς ἐχώρει ἐπί τε Πελοποννησίους καὶ τοὺς τὰ ἐναντία σφίσι μετ’ αὐτῶν πράξαντας .
One of the popular faction replying to him, in the spirit of party, that they would not go out, and did not want a war, and, when he had thus relied, being dragged to him by the hand, and roughly treated, the commons immediately took up their arms, and advanced in a great rage against the Peloponnesians, and those who had joined them in opposition to themselves. Having thus fallen upon them, they routed them, in consequence both of the suddenness of the charge, and of their alarm at the gates being opened to the Athenians;


4.130.5
3363
καὶ προσπεσόντες τρέπουσιν ἅμα μὲν μάχῃ αἰφνιδίῳ , ἅμα δὲ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τῶν πυλῶν ἀνοιγομένων φοβηθέντων ·
They charged and routed them with a sudden attack, while the Athenians were opening the gates in a panic;


4.130.5
3364
ᾠήθησαν γὰρ ἀπὸ προειρημένου τινὸς αὐτοῖς τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν γενέσθαι .
for they imagined that the attack had been made in consequence of some agreement with them.


4.130.6
3365
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐς τὴν ἀκρόπολιν , ὅσοι μὴ αὐτίκα διεφθάρησαν , κατέφυγον , ἥνπερ καὶ τὸ πρότερον αὐτοὶ εἶχον ·
They then, as many as were not immediately killed, took refuge in the citadel, which was before held by themselves;


4.130.6
3366
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἤδη γὰρ καὶ ὁ Νικίας ἐπαναστρέψας πρὸς τῇ πόλει ἦν ) ἐσπεσόντες ἐς τὴν Μένδην πόλιν , ἅτε οὐκ ἀπὸ ξυμβάσεως ἀνοιχθεῖσαν , ἁπάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ ὡς κατὰ κράτος ἑλόντες διήρπασαν , καὶ μόλις οἱ στρατηγοὶ κατέσχον ὥστε μὴ καὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους διαφθείρεσθαι .
while the Athenians (for by this time Nicias also had returned and was close to the town) rushed with all their forces into Mende, inasmuch as it had not thrown open its gates to them on the ground of any convention, and sacked it as though they had taken it by storm; the generals with difficulty restraining them from even butchering the inhabitants.


4.130.7
3367
καὶ τοὺς μὲν Μενδαίους μετὰ ταῦτα πολιτεύειν ἐκέλευον ὥσπερ εἰώθεσαν , αὐτοὺς κρίναντας ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς εἴ τινας ἡγοῦνται αἰτίους εἶναι τῆς ἀποστάσεως ·
Afterwards they told the Mendaeans to retain their civil rights, as usual, after having tried amongst themselves whomever they considered to have been the originators of the revolt:


4.130.7
3368
τοὺς δ’ ἐν τῇ ἀκροπόλει ἀπετείχισαν ἑκατέρωθεν τείχει ἐς θάλασσαν καὶ φυλακὴν ἐπικαθίσταντο .
but the party in the citadel they cut off by a wall down to the sea on each side, and stationed troops to keep guard over them.


4.130.7
3369
ἐπειδὴ δὲ τὰ περὶ τὴν Μένδην κατέσχον , ἐπὶ τὴν Σκιώνην ἐχώρουν .
```plaintext


4.131.1
3370
οἱ δὲ ἀντεπεξελθόντες αὐτοὶ καὶ Πελοποννήσιοι ἱδρύθησαν ἐπὶ λόφου καρτεροῦ πρὸ τῆς πόλεως , ὃν εἰ μὴ ἕλοιεν οἱ ἐναντίοι , οὐκ ἐγίγνετο σφῶν περιτείχισις .
The inhabitants of that town, both themselves and the Peloponnesians, marched out to oppose them, and were posted on a strong hill before the city, without the occupation of which by the enemy there was no possibility of investing them.


4.131.2
3371
προσβαλόντες δ’ αὐτῷ κατὰ κράτος οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ μάχῃ ἐκκρούσαντες τοὺς ἐπόντας ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντό τε καὶ ἐς τὸν περιτειχισμὸν τροπαῖον στήσαντες παρεσκευάζοντο .
So the Athenians attacked it vigorously, and having driven off by their charge those who were upon it, pitched their camp, and after erecting a trophy, prepared for the circumvallation of the place.


4.131.3
3372
καὶ αὐτῶν οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ἤδη ἐν ἔργῳ ὄντων οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως ἐν τῇ Μένδῃ πολιορκούμενοι ἐπίκουροι βιασάμενοι παρὰ θάλασσαν τὴν φυλακὴν νυκτὸς ἀφικνοῦνται , καὶ διαφυγόντες οἱ πλεῖστοι τὸ ἐπὶ τῇ Σκιώνῃ στρατόπεδον ἐσῆλθον ἐς αὐτήν .
Not long after, while they were now engaged in the work, the auxiliaries who were being besieged in the citadel of Mende having, during the night, driven in the guard by the sea-side, arrived at Scione; and most of them escaping through the troops encamped before it, threw themselves into the place.


4.132.1
3373
περιτειχιζομένης δὲ τῆς Σκιώνης Περδίκκας τοῖς τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοῖς ἐπικηρυκευσάμενος ὁμολογίαν ποιεῖται πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους διὰ τὴν τοῦ Βρασίδου ἔχθραν περὶ τῆς ἐκ τῆς Λύγκου ἀναχωρήσεως , εὐθὺς τότε ἀρξάμενος πράσσειν .
While Scione was invested, Perdiccas sent a herald to the Athenian generals, and concluded an arrangement with the Athenians, through his hatred of Brasidas in consequence of the retreat from Lyncus; having begun to negotiate for it from that very time.


4.132.2
3374
καὶ ( ἐτύγχανε γὰρ τότε Ἰσχαγόρας ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος στρατιὰν μέλλων πεζῇ πορεύσειν ὡς Βρασίδαν ) ὁ δὲ Περδίκκας , ἅμα μὲν κελεύοντος τοῦ Νικίου , ἐπειδὴ ξυνεβεβήκει , ἔνδηλόν τι ποιεῖν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις βεβαιότητος πέρι , ἅμα δ’ αὐτὸς οὐκέτι βουλόμενος Πελοποννησίους ἐς τὴν αὑτοῦ ἀφικνεῖσθαι , παρασκευάσας τοὺς ἐν Θεσσαλίᾳ ξένους ,χρώμενος αἰεὶ τοῖς πρώτοις , διεκώλυσε τὸ στράτευμα καὶ τὴν παρασκευήν , ὥστε μηδὲ πειρᾶσθαι Θεσσαλῶν .
And, as Isagoras the Lacedaemonian then happened to be on the point of taking an army by land to join Brasidas, Perdiccas, partly because Nicias advised him, since he had come to terms with the Athenians, to give them some clear proof of his being a firm friend; and partly because he himself wished the Lacedaemonians never again to go to his territories; won over to his views his friends in Thessaly, (for he was always intimate with the principal men,) and stopped the army and its equipments, so that they did not even try the mind of the Thessalians on the subject.


4.132.3
3375
Ἰσχαγόρας μέντοι καὶ Ἀμεινίας καὶ Ἀριστεὺς αὐτοί τε ὡς Βρασίδαν ἀφίκοντο , ἐπιδεῖν πεμψάντων Λακεδαιμονίων τὰ πράγματα , καὶ τῶν ἡβώντων αὐτῶν παρανόμως ἄνδρας ἐξῆγον ἐκ Σπάρτης , ὥστε τῶν πόλεων ἄρχοντας καθιστάναι καὶ μὴ τοῖς ἐντυχοῦσιν ἐπιτρέπειν .
Isagoras, however, Ameinias, and Aristeus, themselves came to Brasidas, being commissioned by the Lacedaemonians to inspect the state of affairs; and took from Sparta, in opposition to the spirit of their laws, some of their young men, with a view to appointing them to the command in the cities, instead of intrusting it to any that might happen to be there at present.


4.132.3
3376
καὶ Κλεαρίδαν μὲν τὸν Κλεωνύμου καθίστησιν ἐν Ἀμφιπόλει , Πασιτελίδαν δὲ τὸν Ἡγησάνδρου ἐν Τορώνῃ .
Accordingly, he appointed Clearidas son of Cleonymus to the command in Amphipolis, and Pasitelidas son of Hegesander in Torone.


4.133.1
3377
ἐν δὲ τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει Θηβαῖοι Θεσπιῶν τεῖχος περιεῖλον ἐπικαλέσαντες ἀττικισμόν , βουλόμενοι μὲν καὶ αἰεί , παρεσχηκὸς δὲ ῥᾷον ἐπειδὴ καὶ ἐν τῇ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους μάχῃ ὅτι ἦν αὐτῶν ἄνθος ἀπωλώλει .
The same summer, the Thebans dismantled the wall of the Thespians, on a charge of their favouring the Athenians; having always wished to do it, but finding it more easy at that time, since all the flower of their population had fallen in the battle against the Athenians.


4.133.2
3378
καὶ ὁ νεὼς τῆς Ἥρας τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους ἐν Ἄργει κατεκαύθη , Χρυσίδος τῆς ἱερείας λύχνον τινὰ θείσης ἡμμένον πρὸς τὰ στέμματα καὶ ἐπικαταδαρθούσης , ὥστε ἔλαθεν ἁφθέντα πάντα καὶ καταφλεχθέντα .
The temple of Juno at Argos was also burnt down that same summer, in consequence of Chrysis the priestess having placed a lighted torch near the garlands, and fallen asleep after it; so that they all caught fire, and were in a flame before she perceived it.


4.133.3
3379
καὶ ἡ Χρυσὶς μὲν εὐθὺς τῆς νυκτὸς δείσασα τοὺς Ἀργείους ἐς Φλειοῦντα φεύγει ·
Chrysis immediately, the same night, fled to Phlius, in her fear of the Argives;


4.133.3
3380
οἱ δὲ ἄλλην ἱέρειαν ἐκ τοῦ νόμου τοῦ προκειμένου κατεστήσαντο Φαεινίδα ὄνομα .
who, according to the law laid down on the subject, appointed another priestess, by name Phaeinis.


4.133.3
3381
ἔτη δὲ ἡ Χρυσὶς τοῦ πολέμου τοῦδε ἐπέλαβεν ὀκτὼ καὶ ἔνατον ἐκ μέσου , ὅτε ἐπεφεύγει .
The priesthood of Chrysis, at the time she fled, embraced eight years of this war, and to the middle of the ninth.


4.133.4
3382
καὶ ἡ Σκιώνη τοῦ θέρους ἤδη τελευτῶντος περιετετείχιστό τε παντελῶς , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπ’ αὐτῇ φυλακὴν καταλιπόντες ἀνεχώρησαν τῷ ἄλλῳ στρατῷ .
And now, towards the close of the summer, Scione was entirely invested; and the Athenians, having left a garrison to keep watch over it, returned with the rest of their army.


4.134.1
3383
ἐν δὲ τῷ ἐπιόντι χειμῶνι τὰ μὲν Ἀθηναίων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων ἡσύχαζε διὰ τὴν ἐκεχειρίαν , Μαντινῆς δὲ καὶ Τεγεᾶται καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἑκατέρων ξυνέβαλον ἐν Λαοδοκείῳ τῆς Ὀρεσθίδος , καὶ νίκη ἀμφιδήριτος ἐγένετο ·
The following winter, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians remained quiet, in consequence of the armistice; but the Mantineans and Tegeans, with the allies on both sides, fought a battle at Laodicium, in the district of Oresthis, and the victory was doubtful;


4.134.1
3384
κέρας γὰρ ἑκάτεροι τρέψαντες τὸ καθ’ αὑτοὺς τροπαῖά τε ἀμφότεροι ἔστησαν καὶ σκῦλα ἐς Δελφοὺς ἀπέπεμψαν .
for each side having put to flight one of the enemy's wings which was opposed to them, they both erected trophies, and sent spoils to Delphi.


4.134.2
3385
διαφθαρέντων μέντοι πολλῶν ἑκατέροις καὶ ἀγχωμάλου τῆς μάχης γενομένης καὶ ἀφελομένης νυκτὸς τὸ ἔργον οἱ Τεγεᾶται μὲν ἐπηυλίσαντό τε καὶ εὐθὺς ἔστησαν τροπαῖον , Μαντινῆς δὲ ἀπεχώρησάν τε ἐς Βουκολιῶνα καὶ ὕστερον ἀντέστησαν .
Though, however, many had fallen on each side, and the battle was undecisive, and night interrupted the action, the Tegeans bi vouacked on the field, and erected a trophy immediately; whereas the Mantineans withdrew to Bucolion, and erected their counter-trophy afterwards.


4.135.1
3386
ἀπεπείρασε δὲ τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος καὶ ὁ Βρασίδας τελευτῶντος καὶ πρὸς ἔαρ ἤδη Ποτειδαίας .
Towards the end of the same winter, and when it was now approaching to spring, Brasidas also made an attempt on Potidaea.


4.135.1
3387
προσελθὼν γὰρ νυκτὸς καὶ κλίμακα προσθεὶς μέχρι μὲν τούτου ἔλαθεν ·
For he went thither by night, and planted a ladder against the wall, and so far escaped observation;


4.135.1
3388
τοῦ γὰρ κώδωνος παρενεχθέντος οὕτως ἐς τὸ διάκενον , πρὶν ἐπανελθεῖν τὸν παραδιδόντα αὐτόν , ἡ πρόσθεσις ἐγένετο ·
the ladder having been planted just in the interval when the bell had been passed round, before the man who passed it returned to that side.


4.135.1
3389
ἔπειτα μέντοι εὐθὺς αἰσθομένων , πρὶν προσβῆναι , ἀπήγαγε πάλιν κατὰ τάχος τὴν στρατιὰν καὶ οὐκ ἀνέμεινεν ἡμέραν γενέσθαι .
Afterwards, however, on their immediately perceiving it, before his troops came up to the place, he led them back again as quickly as possible, and did not wait for the day to break.


4.135.2
3390
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ ἔνατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
And so the winter ended, and the ninth year of this war, of which Thucydides wrote the history. 



5.1.1
3391
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους αἱ μὲν ἐνιαύσιοι σπονδαὶ διελέλυντο μέχρι Πυθίων , καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐκεχειρίᾳ Ἀθηναῖοι Δηλίους ἀνέστησαν ἐκ Δήλου , ἡγησάμενοι κατὰ παλαιάν τινα αἰτίαν οὐ καθαροὺς ὄντας ἱερῶσθαι , καὶ ἅμα ἐλλιπὲς σφίσιν εἶναι τοῦτο τῆς καθάρσεως , ᾗ πρότερόν μοι δεδήλωται ὡς ἀνελόντες τὰς θήκας τῶν τεθνεώτων ὀρθῶς ἐνόμισαν ποιῆσαι .
THE following summer, the truce for a year continued till the Pythian games, and then ended. During the suspension of arms, the Athenians expelled the Delians from their island, thinking that they had been consecrated when in a state of impurity from some crime of ancient date; and, moreover, that this had been the deficiency in their former purification of it; in which case I have before explained that they considered themselves to have performed it rightly by taking up the coffins of the dead.


5.1.1
3392
καὶ οἱ μὲν Δήλιοι Ἀτραμύττιον Φαρνάκου δόντος αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ ᾤκησαν , οὕτως ὡς ἕκαστος ὥρμητο .
The Delians found a residence at Atramyttium in Asia, given to them by Pharnaces, as each of them arrived there.


5.2.1
3393
Κλέων δὲ Ἀθηναίους πείσας ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης χωρία ἐξέπλευσε μετὰ τὴν ἐκεχειρίαν , Ἀθηναίων μὲν ὁπλίτας ἔχων διακοσίους καὶ χιλίους καὶ ἱππέας τριακοσίους , τῶν δὲ ξυμμάχων πλείους , ναῦς δὲ τριάκοντα .
After the armistice had expired, Cleon, having persuaded the Athenians to the measure, led an expedition against the Thrace-ward towns, with twelve hundred heavy-armed, and three hundred cavalry of the Athenians, a larger force of the allies, and thirty ships.


5.2.2
3394
σχὼν δὲ ἐς Σκιώνην πρῶτον ἔτι πολιορκουμένην καὶ προσλαβὼν αὐτόθεν ὁπλίτας τῶν φρουρῶν , κατέπλευσεν ἐς τὸν Κωφὸν λιμένα τῶν Τορωναίων ἀπέχοντα οὐ πολὺ τῆς πόλεως .
After landing in the first place at Scione, which was still being besieged, and taking thence some heavy-armed from the garrison, he sailed into the port of the Colophonians, belonging to the Toronaeans, and at no great distance from their city.


5.2.3
3395
ἐκ δ’ αὐτοῦ , αἰσθόμενος ὑπ’ αὐτομόλων ὅτι οὔτε Βρασίδας ἐν τῇ Τορώνῃ οὔτε οἱ ἐνόντες ἀξιόμαχοι εἶεν , τῇ μὲν στρατιᾷ τῇ πεζῇ ἐχώρει ἐς τὴν πόλιν , ναῦς δὲ περιέπεμψε δέκα ἐς τὸν λιμένα περιπλεῖν .
Thence, having learned from deserters both that Brasidas was not in Torone, and that those who were in it were not strong enough to give him battle, with his land forces he marched against the city, while he sent ten ships to sail round into the harbour.


5.2.4
3396
καὶ πρὸς τὸ περιτείχισμα πρῶτον ἀφικνεῖται , ὃ προσπεριέβαλε τῇ πόλει ὁ Βρασίδας ἐντὸς βουλόμενος ποιῆσαι τὸ προάστειον , καὶ διελὼν τοῦ παλαιοῦ τείχους μίαν αὐτὴν ἐποίησε πόλιν .
First, then, he came to the fortifications which Brasidas had raised anew round the city, from a wish to include the suburb, and so by taking down a part of the original wall had made it one city.


5.3.1
3397
βοηθήσαντες δὲ ἐς αὐτὸ Πασιτελίδας τε ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος ἄρχων καὶ ἡ παροῦσα φυλακὴ προσβαλόντων τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἠμύνοντο .
Pasitelidas, the Lacedaemonians commander, and the garrison that was there, went to the defence of the fortifications, and tried to resist the assault of the Athenians.


5.3.1
3398
καὶ ὡς ἐβιάζοντο καὶ αἱ νῆες ἅμα περιέπλεον αἱ ἐς τὸν λιμένα περιπεμφθεῖσαι , δείσας ὁ Πασιτελίδας μὴ αἵ τε νῆες φθάσωσι λαβοῦσαι ἐρῆμον τὴν πόλιν καὶ τοῦ τειχίσματος ἁλισκομένου ἐγκαταληφθῇ , ἀπολιπὼν αὐτὸ δρόμῳ ἐχώρει ἐς τὴν πόλιν .
When they were being driven in, and the ships that had been sent round were at the same time sailing into the harbour, Pasitelidas, fearing that the ships might find the city deserted by its defenders before he could reach it, and that if the fortifications were carried he might be made prisoner in them, left them, and ran into the city.


5.3.2
3399
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι φθάνουσιν οἵ τε ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν ἑλόντες τὴν Τορώνην καὶ ὁ πεζὸς ἐπισπόμενος αὐτοβοεὶ κατὰ τὸ διῃρημένον τοῦ παλαιοῦ τείχους ξυνεσπεσών .
But the Athenians from the ships had had time to take Torone, and their land forces, rushing after him, on the very first assault burst in with him through the part of the old wall that had been removed.


5.3.2
3400
καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτειναν τῶν Πελοποννησίων καὶ Τορωναίων εὐθὺς ἐν χερσί , τοὺς δὲ ζῶντας ἔλαβον , καὶ Πασιτελίδαν τὸν ἄρχοντα .
And they killed some of the Peloponnesians and Toronaeans immediately, and took others alive, including Pasitelidas the commander.


5.3.3
3401
Βρασίδας δὲ ἐβοήθει μὲν τῇ Τορώνῃ , αἰσθόμενος δὲ καθ’ ὁδὸν ἑαλωκυῖαν ἀνεχώρησεν , ἀποσχὼν τεσσαράκοντα μάλιστα σταδίους μὴ φθάσαι ἐλθών .
And thus some of the Peloponnesians and Toronaeans they slew immediately in close combat, and others they took alive, with Pasitelidas the commander. Now Brasidas was coming to the relief of Torone;


5.3.4
3402
ὁ δὲ Κλέων καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τροπαῖά τε ἔστησαν δύο , τὸ μὲν κατὰ τὸν λιμένα , τὸ δὲ πρὸς τῷ τειχίσματι , καὶ τῶν Τορωναίων γυναῖκας μὲν καὶ παῖδας ἠνδραπόδισαν , αὐτοὺς δὲ καὶ Πελοποννησίους καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος Χαλκιδέων ἦν , ξύμπαντας ἐς ἑπτακοσίους , ἀπέπεμψαν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ·
Cleon and the Athenians erected two trophies, one by the harbour, the other near the fortifications; and sold into slavery the women and children of the Toronaeans, while the men themselves, with the Peloponnesians, and whatever Chalcidians there were besides, seven hundred in all, they sent off to Athens;


5.3.4
3403
καὶ αὐτοῖς τὸ μὲν Πελοποννήσιον ὕστερον ἐν ταῖς γενομέναις σπονδαῖς ἀπῆλθε , τὸ δὲ ἄλλο ἐκομίσθη ὑπ’ Ὀλυνθίων , ἀνὴρ ἀντ’ ἀνδρὸς λυθείς .
whence some of them afterwards were dismissed, on conclusion of peace, while others were recovered by the Olynthians, through an exchange of prisoners.


5.3.5
3404
εἷλον δὲ καὶ Πάνακτον Ἀθηναίων ἐν μεθορίοις τεῖχος Βοιωτοὶ ὑπὸ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον προδοσίᾳ .
About the same time, too, the Boeotians took by treachery Panactum, a fortress of the Athenians on the borders.


5.3.6
3405
καὶ ὁ μὲν Κλέων φυλακὴν καταστησάμενος τῆς Τορώνης ἄρας περιέπλει τὸν Ἄθων ὡς ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν .
Cleon. after establishing a garrison in Torone, weighed anchor and sailed round Athos on his way to Amphipolis.


5.4.1
3406
Φαίαξ δὲ ὁ Ἐρασιστράτου τρίτος αὐτὸς Ἀθηναίων πεμπόντων ναυσὶ δύο ἐς Ἰταλίαν καὶ Σικελίαν πρεσβευτὴς ὑπὸ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον ἐξέπλευσεν .
About this same time, Phaeax, son of Erasistratus, with two colleagues, being commissioned by the Athenians, sailed with two ships as ambassador to Italy and Sicily.


5.4.2
3407
Λεοντῖνοι γὰρ ἀπελθόντων Ἀθηναίων ἐκ Σικελίας μετὰ τὴν ξύμβασιν πολίτας τε ἐπεγράψαντο πολλοὺς καὶ ὁ δῆμος τὴν γῆν ἐπενόει ἀναδάσασθαι .
For on the departure of the Athenians from Sicily after the pacification, the Leontines had enrolled a large number of new citizens, and the commons were thinking of dividing the land.


5.4.3
3408
οἱ δὲ δυνατοὶ αἰσθόμενοι Συρακοσίους τε ἐπάγονται καὶ ἐκβάλλουσι τὸν δῆμον .
When the aristocratical party were aware of it, they called in the Syracusans, and expelled the commons;


5.4.3
3409
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐπλανήθησαν ὡς ἕκαστοι , οἱ δὲ δυνατοὶ ὁμολογήσαντες Συρακοσίοις καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐκλιπόντες καὶ ἐρημώσαντες Συρακούσας ἐπὶ πολιτείᾳ ᾤκησαν .
who wandered about as they severally happened; while the nobles entered into an arrangement with the Syracusans, and having abandoned and laid waste their own city, lived at Syracuse with the enjoyment of the franchise.


5.4.4
3410
καὶ ὕστερον πάλιν αὐτῶν τινὲς διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀρέσκεσθαι ἀπολιπόντες ἐκ τῶν Συρακουσῶν Φωκαίας τε τῆς πόλεώς τι τῆς Λεοντίνων χωρίον καλούμενον καταλαμβάνουσι καὶ Βρικιννίας ὂν ἔρυμα ἐν τῇ Λεοντίνῃ .
Afterwards some of them, in consequence of not being pleased, withdrew from Syracuse, and occupied a quarter of the city of Leontini, called Phocaeae, and Bricinniae, which was a stronghold in the Leontine country.


5.4.4
3411
καὶ τῶν τοῦ δήμου τότε ἐκπεσόντων οἱ πολλοὶ ἦλθον ὡς αὐτούς , καὶ καταστάντες ἐκ τῶν τειχῶν ἐπολέμουν .
There the majority of the popular party who had been expelled, came to them, and having thus established themselves, they carried on the war from the fortifications.


5.4.5
3412
ἃ πυνθανόμενοι οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸν Φαίακα πέμπουσιν , εἴ πως πείσαντες τοὺς σφίσιν ὄντας αὐτόθι ξυμμάχους καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους , ἢν δύνωνται , Σικελιώτας κοινῇ ὡς Συρακοσίων δύναμιν περιποιουμένων ἐπιστρατεῦσαι , διασώσειαν τὸν δῆμον τῶν Λεοντίνων .
The Athenians, hearing this, despatched Phaeax, to try if by any means they might persuade the allies they had there, and the rest of the Sicilians if they could, to join in attacking the Syracusans, on the strength of their gaining such additional power, and thus might save the commons of'


5.4.6
3413
ὁ δὲ Φαίαξ ἀφικόμενος τοὺς μὲν Καμαριναίους πείθει καὶ Ἀκραγαντίνους , ἐν δὲ Γέλᾳ ἀντιστάντος αὐτῷ τοῦ πράγματος οὐκέτι ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἔρχεται , αἰσθόμενος οὐκ ἂν πείθειν αὐτούς , ἀλλ’ ἀναχωρήσας διὰ τῶν Σικελῶν ἐς Κατάνην καὶ ἅμα ἐν τῇ παρόδῳ καὶ ἐς τὰς Βρικιννίας ἐλθὼν καὶ παραθαρσύνας ἀπέπλει .
Leontini. So Phaeax came, and prevailed on the Camarinaeans and Agrigentines; but when the question was settled against him at Gela, he did not then proceed to the others, as he found that he should not prevail on them; but having returned through the country of the Sicels to Catana, and having on his route also visited Bricinniae, and encouraged its inhabitants, he sailed back again.


5.5.1
3414
ἐν δὲ τῇ παρακομιδῇ τῇ ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν καὶ πάλιν ἀναχωρήσει καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἰταλίᾳ τισὶ πόλεσιν ἐχρημάτισε περὶ φιλίας τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , καὶ Λοκρῶν ἐντυγχάνει τοῖς ἐκ Μεσσήνης ἐποίκοις ἐκπεπτωκόσιν , οἳ μετὰ τὴν τῶν Σικελιωτῶν ὁμολογίαν στασιασάντων Μεσσηνίων καὶ ἐπαγαγομένων τῶν ἑτέρων Λοκροὺς ἔποικοι ἐξεπέμφθησαν , καὶ ἐγένετο Μεσσήνη Λοκρῶν τινὰ χρόνον .
On his course to Sicily and return from it, he also communicated with certain cities in Italy on the subject of friendship with the Athenians. He likewise fell in with the Locrian settlers banished from Messana, who, after the pacification effected by the Sicilians, when the Messanians were divided into factions, and one of them had invited the Locrians to their aid, had been sent out for that purpose; and so Messana came into the hands of the Locrians for some time.


5.5.2
3415
τούτοις οὖν ὁ Φαίαξ ἐντυχὼν τοῖς κομιζομένοις οὐκ ἠδίκησεν ·
Phaeax then, having fallen in with these men on their way home, did them no harm, as proposals had been made to him by the Locrians for coming to terms with the Athenians.


5.5.2
3416
ἐγεγένητο γὰρ τοῖς Λοκροῖς πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁμολογία ξυμβάσεως πέρι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους .
For they were the only people of the allies who, when the Sicilians were reconciled to each other, did not make peace with the Athenians: nor would they have done it then, had they not been pressed by hostilities with the Itonaeans and Melaeans, who lived on their borders, and were a colony from them.


5.5.3
3417
μόνοι γὰρ τῶν ξυμμάχων , ὅτε Σικελιῶται ξυνηλλάσσοντο , οὐκ ἐσπείσαντο Ἀθηναίοις , οὐδ’ ἂν τότε , εἰ μὴ αὐτοὺς κατεῖχεν ὁ πρὸς Ἱππωνιᾶς καὶ Μεδμαίους πόλεμος ὁμόρους τε ὄντας καὶ ἀποίκους .
For they were the only people of the allies who, when the Sicilians were reconciled to each other, did not make peace with the Athenians: nor would they have done it then, had they not been pressed by hostilities with the Itonaeans and Melaeans, who lived on their borders, and were a colony from them.


5.5.3
3418
καὶ ὁ μὲν Φαίαξ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας χρόνῳ ὕστερον ἀφίκετο .
So Phaeax returned, and arrived at Athens some time after.


5.6.1
3419
ὁ δὲ Κλέων ὡς ἀπὸ τῆς Τορώνης τότε περιέπλευσεν ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν , ὁρμώμενος ἐκ τῆς Ἠιόνος Σταγίρῳ μὲν προσβάλλει Ἀνδρίων ἀποικίᾳ καὶ οὐχ εἷλε , Ἀληψὸν δὲ τὴν Θασίων ἀποικίαν λαμβάνει κατὰ κράτος .
Now when Cleon, at the lime we last mentioned him, sailed round from Torone to go against Amphipolis, making Eion the base of his operations, he assaulted Stagirus, a colony of the Andrians, but without reducing it; but Galepsus, the Thasian colony, he took by storm.


5.6.2
3420
καὶ πέμψας ὡς Περδίκκαν πρέσβεις , ὅπως παραγένοιτο στρατιᾷ κατὰ τὸ ξυμμαχικόν , καὶ ἐς τὴν Θρᾴκην ἄλλους παρὰ Πολλῆν τὸν Ὀδομάντων βασιλέα , ἄξοντας μισθοῦ Θρᾷκας ὡς πλείστους , αὐτὸς ἡσύχαζε περιμένων ἐν τῇ Ἠιόνι .
And having sent ambassadors to Perdiccas, that he might join him with an army according to the terms of their alliance, and others into Thrace, to Polles, the king of the Odomantians, who was to bring as many Thracian mercenaries as he could, he himself remained quiet in Eion, awaiting their arrival.


5.6.3
3421
Βρασίδας δὲ πυνθανόμενος ταῦτα ἀντεκάθητο καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπὶ τῷ Κερδυλίῳ ·
On hearing this, Brasidas, on his side also, took up an opposite position on Cerdylium.


5.6.3
3422
ἔστι δὲ τὸ χωρίον τοῦτο Ἀργιλίων ἐπὶ μετεώρου πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ , οὐ πολὺ ἀπέχον τῆς Ἀμφιπόλεως , καὶ κατεφαίνετο πάντα αὐτόθεν , ὥστε οὐκ ἂν ἔλαθεν αὐτὸν ὁρμώμενος ὁ Κλέων τῷ στρατῷ ·
This spot is in the Argilian country, being on the high ground on the other side of the river, not far from the city of Amphipolis; and every thing was distinctly seen from it; so that Cleon could not unobserved by him set out with his army;


5.6.3
3423
ὅπερ προσεδέχετο ποιήσειν αὐτόν , ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν , ὑπεριδόντα σφῶν τὸ πλῆθος , τῇ παρούσῃ στρατιᾷ ἀναβήσεσθαι .
as he expected him to do, and despising the numbers of the Lacedaemonians to march up with the forces he had with him against Amphipolis.


5.6.4
3424
ἅμα δὲ καὶ παρεσκευάζετο Θρᾷκάς τε μισθωτοὺς πεντακοσίους καὶ χιλίους , καὶ τοὺς Ἠδῶνας πάντας παρακαλῶν , πελταστὰς καὶ ἱππέας ·
At the same time he was getting ready fifteen hundred Thracian mercenaries, and was calling all the Edonians to his aid, both targeteers and cavalry;


5.6.4
3425
καὶ Μυρκινίων καὶ Χαλκιδέων χιλίους πελταστὰς εἶχε πρὸς τοῖς ἐν Ἀμφιπόλει .
and he had a thousand targeteers of the Myrcinians and Chalcidians, in addition to those in Amphipolis.


5.6.5
3426
τὸ δ’ ὁπλιτικὸν ξύμπαν ἡθροίσθη δισχίλιοι μάλιστα καὶ ἱππῆς Ἕλληνες τριακόσιοι .
All his heavy-armed force too was mustered, about two thousand in number, and three hundred Grecian horse.


5.6.5
3427
τούτων Βρασίδας μὲν ἔχων ἐπὶ Κερδυλίῳ ἐκάθητο ἐς πεντακοσίους καὶ χιλίους , οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἐν Ἀμφιπόλει μετὰ Κλεαρίδου ἐτετάχατο .
With fifteen hundred of these Brasidas stationed himself on Cerdylium, whilst the rest were posted with Clearidas in Amphipolis.


5.7.1
3428
ὁ δὲ Κλέων τέως μὲν ἡσύχαζεν , ἔπειτα ἠναγκάσθη ποιῆσαι ὅπερ ὁ Βρασίδας προσεδέχετο .
Cleon remained quiet for some time, but was then compelled to do what Brasidas had expected.


5.7.2
3429
τῶν γὰρ στρατιωτῶν ἀχθομένων μὲν τῇ ἕδρᾳ , ἀναλογιζομένων δὲ τὴν ἐκείνου ἡγεμονίαν πρὸς οἵαν ἐμπειρίαν καὶ τόλμαν μετὰ οἵας ἀνεπιστημοσύνης καὶ μαλακίας γενήσοιτο καὶ οἴκοθεν ὡς ἄκοντες αὐτῷ ξυνῆλθον , αἰσθόμενος τὸν θροῦν καὶ οὐ βουλόμενος αὐτοὺς διὰ τὸ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ καθημένους βαρύνεσθαι , ἀναλαβὼν ἦγεν .
For his soldiers being annoyed at sitting still, and reflecting, with regard to his command, against what skill and daring in the enemy, with what ignorance and cowardice in himself it would be held, and how unwillingly they had accompanied him from home, he perceived their murmers; and not wishing them to be exasperated by remaining stationary in the same place, he broke up his camp and led them forward.


5.7.3
3430
καὶ ἐχρήσατο τῷ τρόπῳ ᾧπερ καὶ ἐς τὴν Πύλον εὐτυχήσας ἐπίστευσέ τι φρονεῖν ·
And he adopted the same plan as he had also succeeded with at Pylus, and therefore felt confident in his own discernment.


5.7.3
3431
ἐς μάχην μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲ ἤλπισέν οἱ ἐπεξιέναι οὐδένα , κατὰ θέαν δὲ μᾶλλον ἔφη ἀναβαίνειν τοῦ χωρίου , καὶ τὴν μείζω παρασκευὴν περιέμενεν , οὐχ ὡς τῷ ἀσφαλεῖ , ἢν ἀναγκάζηται , περισχήσων , ἀλλ’ ὡς κύκλῳ περιστὰς βίᾳ αἱρήσων τὴν πόλιν .
For that any one would come out against him to battle, he had not so much as a thought; but said that he was going up rather to see the place, and was waiting for his more numerous forces; not for the purpose of gaining a victory without any risk, should he be compelled to engage, but of surrounding the city on all sides, and so taking it by storm.


5.7.4
3432
ἐλθών τε καὶ καθίσας ἐπὶ λόφου καρτεροῦ πρὸ τῆς Ἀμφιπόλεως τὸν στρατὸν αὐτὸς ἐθεᾶτο τὸ λιμνῶδες τοῦ Στρυμόνος καὶ τὴν θέσιν τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ τῇ Θρᾴκῃ ὡς ἔχοι .
Having come, therefore, and posted his army on a strong hill in front of Amphipolis, he himself proceeded to reconnoitre the lake formed by the Strymon, and what was the position of the city on the side of Thrace.


5.7.5
3433
ἀπιέναι τε ἐνόμιζεν , ὁπόταν βούληται , ἀμαχεί ·
He thought to retire, whenever he pleased, without a battle;


5.7.5
3434
καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ ἐφαίνετο οὔτ’ ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους οὐδεὶς οὔτε κατὰ πύλας ἐξῄει , κεκλῃμέναι τε ἦσαν πᾶσαι .
for indeed there was neither any one seen on the wall, nor did any one come out through the gates, but they were all closed:


5.7.5
3435
ὥστε καὶ μηχανὰς ὅτι οὐκ ἀνῆλθεν ἔχων , ἁμαρτεῖν ἐδόκει ·
so that he even considered he had made a mistake in not having come down with engines;


5.7.5
3436
ἑλεῖν γὰρ ἂν τὴν πόλιν διὰ τὸ ἐρῆμον .
for he believed that in that case he might have taken the city.


5.8.1
3437
ὁ δὲ Βρασίδας εὐθὺς ὡς εἶδε κινουμένους τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , καταβὰς καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ Κερδυλίου ἐσέρχεται ἐς τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν .
Immediately that Brasidas saw the Athenians in motion, he too went down from Cerdylium, and entered Amphipolis. Now for any regular sally, and array of troops against the Athenians, he made none;


5.8.2
3438
καὶ ἐπέξοδον μὲν καὶ ἀντίταξιν οὐκ ἐποιήσατο πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , δεδιὼς τὴν αὑτοῦ παρασκευὴν καὶ νομίζων ὑποδεεστέρους εἶναι , οὐ τῷ πλήθει ( ἀντίπαλα γάρ πως ἦν ) , ἀλλὰ τῷ ἀξιώματι ( τῶν γὰρ Ἀθηναίων ὅπερ ἐστράτευε καθαρὸν ἐξῆλθε καὶ Λημνίων καὶ Ἰμβρίων τὸ κράτιστον ) , τέχνῃ δὲ παρεσκευάζετο ἐπιθησόμενος .
being afraid of his own resources, and considering them inferior to the enemy; not so much in numbers, (for they were pretty nearly equal,) but in character; (for it was the flower of the Athenian force that was in the field, and the best of the Lemnians and Imbrians;) but he prepared to attack them by means of a stratagem.


5.8.3
3439
εἰ γὰρ δείξειε τοῖς ἐναντίοις τό τε πλῆθος καὶ τὴν ὅπλισιν ἀναγκαίαν οὖσαν τῶν μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ , οὐκ ἂν ἡγεῖτο μᾶλλον περιγενέσθαι ἢ ἄνευ προόψεώς τε αὐτῶν καὶ μὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄντος καταφρονήσεως .
For if he showed the enemy his numbers, and the equipment of the troops with him, which was such as necessity alone dictated, he did not think that he should conquer them so well as he should without their seeing his forces beforehand, and despising them on sufficient grounds.


5.8.4
3440
ἀπολεξάμενος οὖν αὐτὸς πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν ὁπλίτας καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους Κλεαρίδᾳ προστάξας ἐβουλεύετο ἐπιχειρεῖν αἰφνιδίως πρὶν ἀπελθεῖν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , οὐκ ἂν νομίζων αὐτοὺς ὁμοίως ἀπολαβεῖν αὖθις μεμονωμένους , εἰ τύχοι ἐλθοῦσα αὐτοῖς ἡ βοήθεια .ξυγκαλέσας δὲ τοὺς πάντας στρατιώτας καὶ βουλόμενος παραθαρσῦναί τε καὶ τὴν ἐπίνοιαν φράσαι , ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
Having therefore himself picked out a hundred and fifty heavy-armed, and having put the rest under the command of Clearidas, he purposed making a sudden attack on the Athenians before they could retire; as he did not think that he should catch them again so isolated, if once their reinforcements should have joined them. Calling therefore all his soldiers together, and wishing to encourage them and acquaint them with his design, he spoke to the following effect:


5.9.1
3441
&quot; ἄνδρες Πελοποννήσιοι , ἀπὸ μὲν οἵας χώρας ἥκομεν , ὅτι αἰεὶ διὰ τὸ εὔψυχον ἐλευθέρας , καὶ ὅτι Δωριῆς μέλλετε Ἴωσι μάχεσθαι , ὧν εἰώθατε κρείσσους εἶναι , ἀρκείτω βραχέως δεδηλωμένον ·
" Men of the Peloponnese, with regard to the character of the country from which we are come, namely, that through its bravery it has always been a free country, and that you are Dorians about to engage with Ionians, to whom you are habitually superior, let a brief declaration suffice."


5.9.2
3442
τὴν δὲ ἐπιχείρησιν ᾧ τρόπῳ διανοοῦμαι ποιεῖσθαι , διδάξω , ἵνα μή τῳ τὸ κατ’ ὀλίγον καὶ μὴ ἅπαντας κινδυνεύειν ἐνδεὲς φαινόμενον ἀτολμίαν παράσχῃ .
" But with regard to the present attack, I will explain in what way I purpose making it;"


5.9.3
3443
τοὺς γὰρ ἐναντίους εἰκάζω καταφρονήσει τε ἡμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐλπίσαντας ὡς ἂν ἐπεξέλθοι τις αὐτοῖς ἐς μάχην ἀναβῆναί τε πρὸς τὸ χωρίον καὶ νῦν ἀτάκτως κατὰ θέαν τετραμμένους ὀλιγωρεῖν .
" that the fact of your meeting the danger in small divisions, and not in one body, may not cause a want of courage by an appearance of weakness."


5.9.4
3444
ὅστις δὲ τὰς τοιαύτας ἁμαρτίας τῶν ἐναντίων κάλλιστα ἰδὼν καὶ ἅμα πρὸς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ δύναμιν τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν ποιεῖται μὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ προφανοῦς μᾶλλον καὶ ἀντιπαραταχθέντος ἢ ἐκ τοῦ πρὸς τὸ παρὸν ξυμφέροντος , πλεῖστ’ ἂν ὀρθοῖτο ·
" For I conjecture that it is through contempt of us, and their not expecting any one to march out against them to battle, that the enemy went up to their present position, and are now thinking nothing of us, while, without any order, they are engaged in looking about them. But whoever best observes such mistakes in his opponents, and also plans his attack upon them with regard to his own power, not so much in an open manner and in regular battle-array, as with reference to his present advantage, that man would be most successful."


5.9.5
3445
καὶ τὰ κλέμματα ταῦτα καλλίστην δόξαν ἔχει ἃ τὸν πολέμιον μάλιστ’ ἄν τις ἀπατήσας τοὺς φίλους μέγιστ’ ἂν ὠφελήσειεν .
" And those stratagems by which one would most deceive his enemies, and benefit his friends, have the highest reputation."


5.9.6
3446
ἕως οὖν ἔτι ἀπαράσκευοι θαρσοῦσι καὶ τοῦ ὑπαπιέναι πλέον ἢ τοῦ μένοντος , ἐξ ὧν ἐμοὶ φαίνονται , τὴν διάνοιαν ἔχουσιν , ἐν τῷ ἀνειμένῳ αὐτῶν τῆς γνώμης καὶ πρὶν ξυνταθῆναι μᾶλλον τὴν δόξαν , ἐγὼ μὲν ἔχων τοὺς μετ’ ἐμαυτοῦ καὶ φθάσας , ἢν δύνωμαι , προσπεσοῦμαι δρόμῳ κατὰ μέσον τὸ στράτευμα ·
" While, then, they are still unprepared, yet confident, and are thinking, from what I see, of retiring rather than remaining; while their minds are irresolute, and before their plans are more definitely arranged, I will take my own division, and surprise them, if I can, by falling at full speed on the centre of their forces."


5.9.7
3447
σὺ δέ , Κλεαρίδα , ὕστερον , ὅταν ἐμὲ ὁρᾷς ἤδη προσκείμενον καὶ κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς φοβοῦντα αὐτούς , τοὺς μετὰ σεαυτοῦ τούς τ’ Ἀμφιπολίτας καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ξυμμάχους ἄγων αἰφνιδίως τὰς πύλας ἀνοίξας ἐπεκθεῖν καὶ ἐπείγεσθαι ὡς τάχιστα ξυμμεῖξαι .
" And do you, Clearidas, afterwards, when you see me now charging, and in all probability frightening them, take  division, both the Amphipolitans and the other allies, and suddenly opening the gates rush out against them, and make all haste to close with them as quickly as possible."


5.9.8
3448
ἐλπὶς γὰρ μάλιστα αὐτοὺς οὕτω φοβηθῆναι ·
"For we may expect that in this way they will be most alarmed;


5.9.8
3449
τὸ γὰρ ἐπιὸν ὕστερον δεινότερον τοῖς πολεμίοις τοῦ παρόντος καὶ μαχομένου .
since the force which follows up an attack is more terrible to an enemy than that which is already before him and engaged with him."


5.9.9
3450
καὶ αὐτός τε ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς γίγνου , ὥσπερ σε εἰκὸς ὄντα Σπαρτιάτην , καὶ ὑμεῖς , ὦ ἄνδρες ξύμμαχοι , ἀκολουθήσατε ἀνδρείως , καὶ νομίσατε τρία εἶναι τοῦ καλῶς πολεμεῖν τὸ ἐθέλειν καὶ τὸ αἰσχύνεσθαι καὶ τὸ τοῖς ἄρχουσι πείθεσθαι , καὶ τῇδε ὑμῖν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἢ ἀγαθοῖς γενομένοις ἐλευθερίαν τε ὑπάρχειν καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων ξυμμάχοις κεκλῆσθαι , ἢ Ἀθηναίων τε δούλοις , ἢν τὰ ἄριστα ἄνευ ἀνδραποδισμοῦ ἢ θανατώσεως πράξητε , καὶ δουλείαν χαλεπωτέραν ἢ πρὶν εἴχετε , τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς Ἕλλησι κωλυταῖς γενέσθαι ἐλευθερώσεως .
" And do you be a brave man yourself, as it is natural that you should, being a Spartan; and do ye, allies, follow him courageously; and consider that it is the proof of good soldiership to to be willing, and to be alive to shame, and to obey your commanders. Reflect, too, that on this day you either gain your liberty, if you act bravely, and the title of confederates of the Lacedaemonians; or are slaves of the Athenians—if you fare as well as you possibly can, without being reduced to personal bondage, or put to death—and incur a more galling slavery than before, while you oppose the liberation of the rest of the Greeks."


5.9.10
3451
ἀλλὰ μήτε ὑμεῖς μαλακισθῆτε , ὁρῶντες περὶ ὅσων ὁ ἀγών ἐστιν , ἐγώ τε δείξω οὐ παραινέσαι οἷός τε ὢν μᾶλλον τοῖς πέλας ἢ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔργῳ ἐπεξελθεῖν &quot; .
" Do not you, then, act as cowards, seeing for how much you are struggling; and  will show you that I am not better able to give advice to others, than to carry it out in action myself."


5.10.1
3452
ὁ μὲν Βρασίδας τοσαῦτα εἰπὼν τήν τε ἔξοδον παρεσκευάζετο αὐτὸς καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους μετὰ τοῦ Κλεαρίδα καθίστη ἐπὶ τὰς Θρᾳκίας καλουμένας τῶν πυλῶν , ὅπως ὥσπερ εἴρητο ἐπεξίοιεν .
Having thus spoken, Brasidas himself prepared for marching out, and posted the rest of the troops with Clearidas at what were called the Thracian gates, to sally out after him, as had been arranged.


5.10.2
3453
τῷ δὲ Κλέωνι , φανεροῦ γενομένου αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ Κερδυλίου καταβάντος καὶ ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐπιφανεῖ οὔσῃ ἔξωθεν περὶ τὸ ἱερὸν τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς θυομένου καὶ ταῦτα πράσσοντος , ἀγγέλλεται ( προυκεχωρήκει γὰρ τότε κατὰ τὴν θέαν ) ὅτι ἥ τε στρατιὰ ἅπασα φανερὰ τῶν πολεμίων ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ὑπὸ τὰς πύλας ἵππων τε πόδες πολλοὶ καὶ ἀνθρώπων ὡς ἐξιόντων ὑποφαίνονται .
His descent from Cerdylium having been observed, as also his sacrificing, when he was in the city —of which a view is commanded from the outside—near the temple of Minerva, and his being occupied with these measures, tidings were carried to Cleon (for he had gone forward at the time to look about him) that the enemy's whole force was visible in the city; and that under the gates were observed many feet of horses and men, as though prepared to make a sally.


5.10.3
3454
ὁ δὲ ἀκούσας ἐπῆλθεν ·
On receiving this intelligence he came up to the spot;


5.10.3
3455
καὶ ὡς εἶδεν , οὐ βουλόμενος μάχῃ διαγωνίσασθαι πρίν οἱ καὶ τοὺς βοηθοὺς ἥκειν καὶ οἰόμενος φθήσεσθαι ἀπελθών , σημαίνειν τε ἅμα ἐκέλευεν ἀναχώρησιν καὶ παρήγγειλε τοῖς ἀπιοῦσιν ἐπὶ τὸ εὐώνυμον κέρας , ὥσπερ μόνον οἷόν τ’ ἦν , ὑπάγειν ἐπὶ τῆς Ἠιόνος .
and when he saw that it was so, not wishing to come to a decisive engagement before his reinforcements also had arrived, and thinking that he should have time to retire, he at once gave orders for the signal to march back, and sent word to the troops on the retreat to draw off in the direction of Eion, moving on their left wing;


5.10.4
3456
ὡς δ’ αὐτῷ ἐδόκει σχολὴ γίγνεσθαι , αὐτὸς ἐπιστρέψας τὸ δεξιὸν καὶ τὰ γυμνὰ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους δοὺς ἀπῆγε τὴν στρατιάν .
which indeed was the only way they could.


5.10.5
3457
κ- ἐν τούτῳ Βρασίδας ὡς ὁρᾷ τὸν καιρὸν καὶ τὸ στράτευμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων κινούμενον , λέγει τοῖς μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ὅτι &quot; οἱ ἄνδρες ἡμᾶς οὐ μενοῦσιν .
But when he thought there was a dilatoriness on their part, he himself made the right wing turn round, and presenting their exposed side to the enemy, began to lead off his troops.


5.10.5
3458
δῆλοι δὲ τῶν τε δοράτων τῇ κινήσει καὶ τῶν κεφαλῶν ·
Upon this, Brasidas, marking his opportunity, and seeing that the Athenian force was on the move, says to his own company and the rest: "The men are not disposed to wait for us, as is evident by the motion of their spears and of their heads;


5.10.5
3459
οἷς γὰρ ἂν τοῦτο γίγνηται , οὐκ εἰώθασι μένειν τοὺς ἐπιόντας .
for those who have this going on amongst them do not generally receive the charge of their assailants.


5.10.5
3460
ἀλλὰ τάς τε πύλας τις ἀνοιγέτω ἐμοὶ ἃς εἴρηται , καὶ ἐπεξίωμεν ὡς τάχιστα θαρσοῦντες &quot; .
But let some one open for me the gates that have been appointed, and let us sally forth with all speed and confidence."


5.10.6
3461
καὶ ὁ μὲν κατὰ τὰς ἐπὶ τὸ σταύρωμα πύλας καὶ τὰς πρώτας τοῦ μακροῦ τείχους τότε ὄντος ἐξελθὼν ἔθει δρόμῳ τὴν ὁδὸν ταύτην εὐθεῖαν , ᾗπερ νῦν κατὰ τὸ καρτερώτατον τοῦ χωρίου ἰόντι τροπαῖον ἕστηκε , καὶ προσβαλὼν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις πεφοβημένοις τε ἅμα τῇ σφετέρᾳ ἀταξίᾳ καὶ τὴν τόλμαν αὐτοῦ ἐκπεπληγμένοις κατὰ μέσον τὸ στράτευμα τρέπει .
" So then let somebody throw open for me the gates I have mentioned, and let us march out against them as quickly as possible, and with good courage."  He, accordingly, sallied out by the gates near the stockade, the first in the long wall which was then standing, and ran full speed along the high road, where the trophy now stands, as you go by the strongest part of the position;


5.10.7
3462
καὶ ὁ Κλεαρίδας , ὥσπερ εἴρητο , ἅμα κατὰ τὰς Θρᾳκίας πύλας ἐπεξελθὼν τῷ στρατῷ ἐπεφέρετο .
Clearidas too, as had been arranged, sallied out after him by the Thracian gates, and rushed upon the enemy's troops.


5.10.7
3463
ξυνέβη τε τῷ ἀδοκήτῳ καὶ ἐξαπίνης ἀμφοτέρωθεν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους θορυβηθῆναι , καὶ τὸ μὲν εὐώνυμον κέρας αὐτῶν τὸ πρὸς τὴν Ἠιόνα , ὅπερ δὴ καὶ προυκεχωρήκει , εὐθὺς ἀπορραγὲν ἔφευγεν ·
and falling on the Athenians, who were both terrified by their own disorder and confounded by his boldness, in the centre of their forces, he put them to the rout.


5.10.8
3464
καὶ ὁ Βρασίδας ὑποχωροῦντος ἤδη αὐτοῦ ἐπιπαριὼν τῷ δεξιῷ τιτρώσκεται , καὶ πεσόντα αὐτὸν οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι οὐκ αἰσθάνονται , οἱ δὲ πλησίον ἄραντες ἀπήνεγκαν .
The consequence was, that by this unexpected and sudden charge on both sides, the enemy were thrown into confusion; and their left wing, on the side of Eion, which had already advanced some distance, immediately broke away and fled.


5.10.9
3465
τὸ δὲ δεξιὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἔμενέ τε μᾶλλον , καὶ ὁ μὲν Κλέων , ὡς τὸ πρῶτον οὐ διενοεῖτο μένειν , εὐθὺς φεύγων καὶ καταληφθεὶς ὑπὸ Μυρκινίου πελταστοῦ ἀποθνῄσκει , οἱ δὲ αὐτοῦ ξυστραφέντες ὁπλῖται ἐπὶ τὸν λόφον τόν τε Κλεαρίδαν ἠμύνοντο καὶ δὶς ἢ τρὶς προσβαλόντα , καὶ οὐ πρότερον ἐνέδοσαν πρὶν ἥ τε Μυρκινία καὶ ἡ Χαλκιδικὴ ἵππος καὶ οἱ πελτασταὶ περιστάντες καὶ ἐσακοντίζοντες αὐτοὺς ἔτρεψαν .
When it was now on its retreat, Brasidas, in advancing along to attack the right wing, received a wound; and while the Athenians did not observe his fall, those who were near him took him up, and carried him off the field. The right of the Athenians, however, stood its ground better; and though Cleon, who from the first had no intention of making a stand, immediately fled, and was overtaken and killed by a Myrcinian targeteer, his heavy-armed retreated in a close body to the hill, and repulsed the charge of Clearidas twine or thrice, and did not give way till the Myrcinian and Chalcidian horse, with the targeteers, having surrounded them, and pouring their missiles upon them, put them to the rout.


5.10.10
3466
οὕτω δὴ τὸ στράτευμα πᾶν ἤδη τῶν Ἀθηναίων φυγὸν χαλεπῶς καὶ πολλὰς ὁδοὺς τραπόμενοι κατὰ ὄρη , ὅσοι μὴ διεφθάρησαν ἢ αὐτίκα ἐν χερσὶν ἢ ὑπὸ τῆς Χαλκιδικῆς ἵππου καὶ τῶν πελταστῶν , οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπεκομίσθησαν ἐς τὴν Ἠιόνα .
And so now the whole army of the Athenians, flying with great difficulty, and taking many different roads over the mountains, effected their return to Eion;


5.10.11
3467
οἱ δὲ τὸν Βρασίδαν ἄραντες ἐκ τῆς μάχης καὶ διασώσαντες ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἔτι ἔμπνουν ἐσεκόμισαν ·
Those who had taken up and rescued Brasidas, carried him still breathing into the city;


5.10.11
3468
καὶ ᾔσθετο μὲν ὅτι νικῶσιν οἱ μεθ’ αὑτοῦ , οὐ πολὺ δὲ διαλιπὼν ἐτελεύτησεν .
where he lived to hear that his troops were victorious, but after a short interval expired.


5.10.12
3469
καὶ ἡ ἄλλη στρατιὰ ἀναχωρήσασα μετὰ τοῦ Κλεαρίδου ἐκ τῆς διώξεως νεκρούς τε ἐσκύλευσε καὶ τροπαῖον ἔστησεν .
The rest of the army, on returning with Clearidas from the pursuit, stripped the dead, and erected a trophy.


5.11.1
3470
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα τὸν Βρασίδαν οἱ ξύμμαχοι πάντες ξὺν ὅπλοις ἐπισπόμενοι δημοσίᾳ ἔθαψαν ἐν τῇ πόλει πρὸ τῆς νῦν ἀγορᾶς οὔσης ·
After this all the allies attended in arms, and interred Brasidas at the public expense in the city, in front of the present market-place.


5.11.1
3471
καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν οἱ Ἀμφιπολῖται , περιείρξαντες αὐτοῦ τὸ μνημεῖον , ὡς ἥρωί τε ἐντέμνουσι καὶ τιμὰς δεδώκασιν ἀγῶνας καὶ ἐτησίους θυσίας , καὶ τὴν ἀποικίαν ὡς οἰκιστῇ προσέθεσαν , καταβαλόντες τὰ Ἁγνώνεια οἰκοδομήματα καὶ ἀφανίσαντες εἴ τι μνημόσυνόν που ἔμελλεν αὐτοῦ τῆς οἰκίσεως περιέσεσθαι , νομίσαντες τὸν μὲν Βρασίδαν σωτῆρά τε σφῶν γεγενῆσθαι καὶ ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἅμα τὴν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ξυμμαχίαν φόβῳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων θεραπεύοντες , τὸν δὲ Ἅγνωνα κατὰ τὸ πολέμιον τῶν Ἀθηναίων οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως σφίσι ξυμφόρως οὐδ’ ἂν ἡδέως τὰς τιμὰς ἔχειν .
And ever since the Amphipolitans, having enclosed his tomb with a fence, have made offerings to him as to a hero, and have given him the honour of games and annual sacrifices. They also referred the settlement to him as its founder, demolishing the buildings of Hagnon, and obliterating whatever memorial of his founding the place was likely to remain: for they considered that Brasidas had been their preserver; and at the present time too, through fear of the Athenians, they courted the Lacedaemonians confederacy; while, on the other hand, they thought that Hagnon, in consequence of their hostility towards the Athenians, would not retain his honours either so beneficially or so agreeably to them.


5.11.2
3472
καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἀπέδοσαν .
The dead they restored to the Athenians.


5.11.2
3473
ἀπέθανον δὲ Ἀθηναίων μὲν περὶ ἑξακοσίους , τῶν δ’ ἐναντίων ἑπτά , διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐκ παρατάξεως , ἀπὸ δὲ τοιαύτης ξυντυχίας καὶ προεκφοβήσεως τὴν μάχην μᾶλλον γενέσθαι .
There were killed, of the Athenians, about six hundred; of their adversaries, only seven; because the battle was not fought with any regular order, but was rather brought on by such an accidental occurrence and previous alarm as has been described.


5.11.3
3474
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἀναίρεσιν οἱ μὲν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀπέπλευσαν , οἱ δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Κλεαρίδου τὰ περὶ τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν καθίσταντο .
After taking up their dead, the Athenians sailed away home; while Clearidas and his party proceeded to settle matters about Amphipolis.


5.12.1
3475
καὶ ὑπὸ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τοῦ θέρους τελευτῶντος Ῥαμφίας καὶ Αὐτοχαρίδας καὶ Ἐπικυδίδας Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης χωρία βοήθειαν ἦγον ἐνακοσίων ὁπλιτῶν , καὶ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Ἡράκλειαν τὴν ἐν Τραχῖνι καθίσταντο ὅτι αὐτοῖς ἐδόκει μὴ καλῶς ἔχειν .
About the same time, towards the close of the summer, Ramphias, Autocharidas, and Epicydidas, Lacedaemonians, led a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy-armed to the Thraceward towns, and on their arrival at Heraclea in Trachinia arranged whatever appeared to them not to be on a good footing.


5.12.2
3476
ἐνδιατριβόντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἔτυχεν ἡ μάχη αὕτη γενομένη , καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
While they thus prolonged their stay in the place, this battle of Amphipolis happened to be fought; and so the summer ended


5.13.1
3477
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος εὐθὺς μέχρι μὲν Πιερίου τῆς Θεσσαλίας διῆλθον οἱ περὶ τὸν Ῥαμφίαν , κωλυόντων δὲ τῶν Θεσσαλῶν καὶ ἅμα Βρασίδου τεθνεῶτος , ᾧπερ ἦγον τὴν στρατιάν , ἀπετράποντο ἐπ’ οἴκου , νομίσαντες οὐδένα καιρὸν ἔτι εἶναι τῶν τε Ἀθηναίων ἥσσῃ ἀπεληλυθότων καὶ οὐκ ἀξιόχρεων αὐτῶν ὄντων δρᾶν τι ὧν κ- ἐκεῖνος ἐπενόει .
The following winter, Ramphias and his companions immediately passed through the country as far as Pierius in Thessaly; but as the Thessalians forbad their advance, and as Brasidas, moreover, was dead, to whom they were leading the force, they turned back home; thinking the time for action had gone by; as both the Athenians had departed in consequence of their defeat, and  were not competent to execute any of designs.


5.13.2
3478
μάλιστα δὲ ἀπῆλθον εἰδότες τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , ὅτε ἐξῇσαν , πρὸς τὴν εἰρήνην μᾶλλον τὴν γνώμην ἔχοντας .
But, most of all, they returned because they knew that the Lacedaemonians, at the time of their setting out, were more strongly disposed for peace.


5.14.1
3479
ξυνέβη τε εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν ἐν Ἀμφιπόλει μάχην καὶ τὴν Ῥαμφίου ἀναχώρησιν ἐκ Θεσσαλίας ὥστε πολέμου μὲν μηδὲν ἔτι ἅψασθαι μηδετέρους , πρὸς δὲ τὴν εἰρήνην μᾶλλον τὴν γνώμην εἶχον , οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι πληγέντες ἐπί τε τῷ Δηλίῳ καὶ δι’ ὀλίγου αὖθις ἐν Ἀμφιπόλει , καὶ οὐκ ἔχοντες τὴν ἐλπίδα τῆς ῥώμης πιστὴν ἔτι , ᾗπερ οὐ προσεδέχοντο πρότερον τὰς σπονδάς , δοκοῦντες τῇ παρούσῃ εὐτυχίᾳ καθυπέρτεροι γενήσεσθαι ·
It happened too, immediately after the battle of Amphipolis and the retreat of Ramphias from Thessaly, that neither party any longer applied themselves at all to the war, but they were rather inclined for peace. The Athenians were so, as having received a severe blow at Delium, and again shortly after at Amphipolis; and as no longer having that confident hope in their strength, through which they would not before accept the offered treaty, thinking, in consequence of their present success, that they should come off victorious in the struggle.


5.14.2
3480
καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἅμα ἐδέδισαν σφῶν μὴ διὰ τὰ σφάλματα ἐπαιρόμενοι ἐπὶ πλέον ἀποστῶσι , μετεμέλοντό τε ὅτι μετὰ τὰ ἐν Πύλῳ καλῶς παρασχὸν οὐ ξυνέβησαν ·
Besides, they were also afraid of their allies, lest they should be encouraged by their reverses to revolt on a larger scale; and they repented not having come to an arrangement, when they had a fine opportunity, after the events at Pylus.


5.14.3
3481
οἱ δ’ αὖ Λακεδαιμόνιοι παρὰ γνώμην μὲν ἀποβαίνοντος σφίσι τοῦ πολέμου , ἐν ᾧ ᾤοντο ὀλίγων ἐτῶν καθαιρήσειν τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων δύναμιν , εἰ τὴν γῆν τέμνοιεν , περιπεσόντες δὲ τῇ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ξυμφορᾷ , οἵα οὔπω ἐγεγένητο τῇ Σπάρτῃ , καὶ λῃστευομένης τῆς χώρας ἐκ τῆς Πύλου καὶ Κυθήρων , αὐτομολούντων τε τῶν Εἱλώτων καὶ αἰεὶ προσδοκίας οὔσης μή τι καὶ οἱ ὑπομένοντες τοῖς ἔξω πίσυνοι πρὸς τὰ παρόντα σφίσιν ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον νεωτερίσωσιν .
The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, wished for peace, because they found protracted beyond their expectation those hostilities by which they imagined that in a few years they should reduce the power of the Athenians, if they ravaged their land; and because they had met with the disaster on the island—such as had never yet befallen Sparta: and in consequence of their country being plundered from Pylus and Cythera; while their helots also were deserting, and there was a constant apprehension lest even those that remained in the country, trusting in the support of those who were out of it, should, on the strength of the present state of things, adopt some revolutionary designs against them, as on a former occasion.


5.14.4
3482
ξυνέβαινε δὲ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους αὐτοῖς τὰς τριακοντούτεις σπονδὰς ἐπ’ ἐξόδῳ εἶναι , καὶ ἄλλας οὐκ ἤθελον σπένδεσθαι οἱ Ἀργεῖοι εἰ μή τις αὐτοῖς τὴν Κυνουρίαν γῆν ἀποδώσει , ὥστ’ ἀδύνατα εἶναι ἐφαίνετο Ἀργείοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις ἅμα πολεμεῖν .
It happened, too, that their thirty years' truce with the Argives was on the point of expiring, and the Argives would not renew it, unless the Cynurian territory were restored to them; so that it appeared impossible for them to carry on war at once with the Argives and Athenians.


5.14.4
3483
τῶν τε ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ πόλεων ὑπώπτευόν τινας ἀποστήσεσθαι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους ·
Besides, they suspected that some of the states in the Peloponnese would revolt from them to the Argives;


5.14.4
3484
ὅπερ καὶ ἐγένετο .
as was really the case.


5.15.1
3485
ταῦτ’ οὖν ἀμφοτέροις αὐτοῖς λογιζομένοις ἐδόκει ποιητέα εἶναι ἡ ξύμβασις , καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις , ἐπιθυμίᾳ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ἐκ τῆς νήσου κομίσασθαι ·
On these considerations both parties thought it best to conclude the arrangement; and particularly the Lacedaemonians, through the desire of recovering their men taken in the island;


5.15.1
3486
ἦσαν γὰρ οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται αὐτῶν πρῶτοί τε καὶ † ὁμοίως † σφίσι ξυγγενεῖς .
for those of them who were Spartans were of the highest rank, and connected with themselves in the same way.


5.15.2
3487
ἤρξαντο μὲν οὖν καὶ εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν ἅλωσιν αὐτῶν πράσσειν , ἀλλ’ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὔπως ἤθελον , εὖ φερόμενοι , ἐπὶ τῇ ἴσῃ καταλύεσθαι .
They began therefore to negotiate immediately after their capture;


5.15.2
3488
σφαλέντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τῷ Δηλίῳ παραχρῆμα οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , γνόντες νῦν μᾶλλον ἂν ἐνδεξαμένους , ποιοῦνται τὴν ἐνιαύσιον ἐκεχειρίαν , ἐν ᾗ ἔδει ξυνιόντας καὶ περὶ τοῦ πλέονος χρόνου βουλεύεσθαι .
but the Athenians, being so successful, would not yet make peace on fair terms. When, however, they had been defeated at Delium, immediately the Lacedaemonians, finding that they would now be more ready to accept their proposals, concluded the armistice for a year, during which they should meet together, and consult respecting a treaty for a longer period.


5.16.1
3489
ἐπειδὴ δὲ καὶ ἡ ἐν Ἀμφιπόλει ἧσσα τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐγεγένητο καὶ ἐτεθνήκει Κλέων τε καὶ Βρασίδας , οἵπερ ἀμφοτέρωθεν μάλιστα ἠναντιοῦντο τῇ εἰρήνῃ , ὁ μὲν διὰ τὸ εὐτυχεῖν τε καὶ τιμᾶσθαι ἐκ τοῦ πολεμεῖν , ὁ δὲ γενομένης ἡσυχίας καταφανέστερος νομίζων ἂν εἶναι κακουργῶν καὶ ἀπιστότερος διαβάλλων , τότε δὴ ἑκατέρᾳ τῇ πόλει σπεύδοντες τὰ μάλιστα τὴν ἡγεμονίαν Πλειστοάναξ τε ὁ Παυσανίου βασιλεὺς Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Νικίας ὁ Νικηράτου , πλεῖστα τῶν τότε εὖ φερόμενος ἐν στρατηγίαις , πολλῷ δὴ μᾶλλον προυθυμοῦντο , Νικίας μὲν βουλόμενος , ἐν ᾧ ἀπαθὴς ἦν καὶ ἠξιοῦτο , διασώσασθαι τὴν εὐτυχίαν , καὶ ἔς τε τὸ αὐτίκα πόνων πεπαῦσθαι καὶ αὐτὸς καὶ τοὺς πολίτας παῦσαι καὶ τῷ μέλλοντι χρόνῳ καταλιπεῖν ὄνομα ὡς οὐδὲν σφήλας τὴν πόλιν διεγένετο , νομίζων ἐκ τοῦ ἀκινδύνου τοῦτο ξυμβαίνειν καὶ ὅστις ἐλάχιστα τύχῃ αὑτὸν παραδίδωσι , τὸ δὲ ἀκίνδυνον τὴν εἰρήνην παρέχειν , Πλειστοάναξ δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν ἐχθρῶν διαβαλλόμενος περὶ τῆς καθόδου , καὶ ἐς ἐνθυμίαν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις αἰεὶ προβαλλόμενος ὑπ’ αὐτῶν , ὁπότε τι πταίσειαν , ὡς διὰ τὴν ἐκείνου κάθοδον παρανομηθεῖσαν ταῦτα ξυμβαίνοι .
And when, moreover, the defeat at Amphipolis had befallen the Athenians, and Cleon and Brasidas were dead, who on each side were most opposed to the cause of peace-the one, because he was successful and honoured in consequence of the war; the other, because he thought, that if tranquillity were secured, he would be more easily detected in his evil practices, and less believed in his calumniations-then the individuals who in either country were most desirous of taking the lead, namely, Pleistoanax son of Pausanias, king of the Lacedaemonians, and Nicias son of Niceratus, who of all his contemporaries was most generally successful in his military commands, were much more anxious for peace than ever. Nicias was so, because he wished, while he had met with no disaster, and was in high repute, permanently to secure his good fortune; and both at present to obtain a respite from troubles himself and give his countrymen the same, and to hand down to futurity a name for having continued to the end without subjecting the state to any disaster; and he thought that such a result is secured by freedom from danger, and by a man's committing himself as little as possible to fortune, and that such freedom from danger is afforded by peace. Pleistoanax, on the other hand, took the same view, because he was calumniated by his enemies on the subject of his restoration, and was continually being brought forward by them as the object of religious scruple on the part of the Lacedaemonians, whenever they met with any defeat; as though it were owing to his illegal restoration that these things befell them.


5.16.2
3490
τὴν γὰρ πρόμαντιν τὴν ἐν Δελφοῖς ἐπῃτιῶντο αὐτὸν πεῖσαι μετ’ Ἀριστοκλέους τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ὥστε χρῆσαι Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐπὶ πολὺ τάδε θεωροῖς ἀφικνουμένοις , Διὸς υἱοῦ ἡμιθέου τὸ σπέρμα ἐκ τῆς ἀλλοτρίας ἐς τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀναφέρειν , εἰ δὲ μή , ἀργυρέᾳ εὐλάκᾳ εὐλαξεῖν ·
For they charged him with having, in concert with Aristocles, his brother, prevailed on the prophetess at Delphi to give the following charge to such Lacedaemonians as went, during a long period, to consult the oracle; " that they should bring back the seed of the demigod son of Jupiter from a foreign land to his own; else they would plough with a silver share."


5.16.3
3491
χρόνῳ δὲ προτρέψαι τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους φεύγοντα αὐτὸν ἐς Λύκαιον διὰ τὴν ἐκ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ποτὲ μετὰ δώρων δοκήσεως ἀναχώρησιν , καὶ ἥμισυ τῆς οἰκίας τοῦ ἱεροῦ τότε τοῦ Διὸς οἰκοῦντα φόβῳ τῷ Λακεδαιμονίων , ἔτει ἑνὸς δέοντι εἰκοστῷ τοῖς ὁμοίοις χοροῖς καὶ θυσίαις καταγαγεῖν ὥσπερ ὅτε τὸ πρῶτον Λακεδαίμονα κτίζοντες τοὺς βασιλέας καθίσταντο .
And so they said that in the course of time, when he had gone as an exile to Lycaeum, (in consequence of his former return from Attica, which was thought to have been effected by bribery,) and had then, through fear of the Lacedaemonians, half his house within the sanctuary of Jupiter, he induced them, in the nineteenth year of his exile, to restore him with the same dances and sacrifices as when they appointed their kings on first settling in Lacedaemonian.


5.17.1
3492
ἀχθόμενος οὖν τῇ διαβολῇ ταύτῃ καὶ νομίζων ἐν εἰρήνῃ μὲν οὐδενὸς σφάλματος γιγνομένου καὶ ἅμα τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τοὺς ἄνδρας κομιζομένων κἂν αὐτὸς τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἀνεπίληπτος εἶναι , πολέμου δὲ καθεστῶτος αἰεὶ ἀνάγκην εἶναι τοὺς προύχοντας ἀπὸ τῶν ξυμφορῶν διαβάλλεσθαι , προυθυμήθη τὴν ξύμβασιν .
Being annoyed therefore by this calumny, and thinking that in time of peace, when no reverse was experienced, and when, moreover, the Lacedaemonians were recovering their men from the island, he too should give his enemies no handle against him; whereas, as long as there was war, the leading men must always be exposed to accusations from the occurrence of disasters; he was ardently desirous of the pacification.


5.17.2
3493
καὶ τόν τε χειμῶνα τοῦτον ᾖσαν ἐς λόγους καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἔαρ ἤδη παρασκευή τε προεπανεσείσθη ἀπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων περιαγγελλομένη κατὰ πόλεις ὡς ἐς ἐπιτειχισμόν , ὅπως οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι μᾶλλον ἐσακούοιεν , καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐκ τῶν ξυνόδων ἅμα πολλὰς δικαιώσεις προενεγκόντων ἀλλήλοις ξυνεχωρεῖτο ὥστε ἃ ἑκάτεροι πολέμῳ ἔσχον ἀποδόντας τὴν εἰρήνην ποιεῖσθαι , Νίσαιαν δ’ ἔχειν Ἀθηναίους ( ἀνταπαιτούντων γὰρ Πλάταιαν οἱ Θηβαῖοι ἔφασαν οὐ βίᾳ , ἀλλ’ ὁμολογίᾳ αὐτῶν προσχωρησάντων καὶ οὐ προδόντων ἔχειν τὸ χωρίον , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ τὴν Νίσαιαν ) , τότε δὴ παρακαλέσαντες τοὺς ἑαυτῶν ξυμμάχους οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , καὶ ψηφισαμένων πλὴν Βοιωτῶν καὶ Κορινθίων καὶ Ἠλείων καὶ Μεγαρέων τῶν ἄλλων ὥστε καταλύεσθαι ( τούτοις δὲ οὐκ ἤρεσκε τὰ πρασσόμενα ) , ποιοῦνται τὴν ξύμβασιν καὶ ἐσπείσαντο πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ ὤμοσαν , ἐκεῖνοί τε πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , τάδε .
And so during this winter they were meeting in conference; and when it was now close upon spring, The terrors of an armament, for which orders were sent round to the different states, as though for the purpose of building forts, were held forth by the Lacedaemonians, that the Athenians might the more readily listen to them. And when, after these conferences had been held. and they had urged many claims against each other, it was agreed that they should make peace on restoring what they had respectively taken during the war; but that the Athenians should keep Nisaea; (for on their demanding back Plataea, the Thebans said that it was not by force that they held the place, but in consequence of the inhabitants themselves having surrendered on definite terms, and not betrayed it to them; and the Athenians maintained that in the same way had  got possession of Nisaea;) then the Lacedaemonians convened their allies; and when all the rest, except the Boeotians, Corinthians, Eleans, and Megareans, who were displeased with what was being done, had voted for putting an end to the war, they concluded the arrangement, and made a treaty and bound themselves by oaths to the Athenians, and they to them, to the following effect:


5.18.1
3494
&quot; σπονδὰς ἐποιήσαντο Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι κατὰ τάδε , καὶ ὤμοσαν κατὰ πόλεις .
1st, "The Athenians and Lacedaemonians, with their allies, made a treaty on the following terms, and swore to observe it, state by state.


5.18.2
3495
περὶ μὲν τῶν ἱερῶν τῶν κοινῶν , θύειν καὶ ἰέναι καὶ μαντεύεσθαι καὶ θεωρεῖν κατὰ τὰ πάτρια τὸν βουλόμενον καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν ἀδεῶς .
With regard to the temples common to the nation, that whoever wishes shall sacrifice, and go for that purpose, and consult the oracle, and attend the games, according to the custom of his fathers, whether proceeding by sea or land, without fear.


5.18.2
3496
τὸ δ’ ἱερὸν καὶ τὸν νεὼν τὸν ἐν Δελφοῖς τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Δελφοὺς αὐτονόμους εἶναι καὶ αὐτοτελεῖς καὶ αὐτοδίκους καὶ αὑτῶν καὶ τῆς γῆς τῆς ἑαυτῶν κατὰ τὰ πάτρια .
That the temple and shrine of Apollo at Delphi, and the Delphians, shall be independent, self-taxed, and self-judged, as regards both themselves and their territory, according to their hereditary usage.


5.18.3
3497
ἔτη δὲ εἶναι τὰς σπονδὰς πεντήκοντα Ἀθηναίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις τοῖς Ἀθηναίων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίων ἀδόλους καὶ ἀβλαβεῖς καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν .
3rd, "That the treaty shall be in force fifty years between the Athenians and their allies, and the Lacedaemonians and theirs, without guile or wrong, by land and by sea.


5.18.4
3498
ὅπλα δὲ μὴ ἐξέστω ἐπιφέρειν ἐπὶ πημονῇ μήτε Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐπ’ Ἀθηναίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους μήτε Ἀθηναίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐπὶ Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους , μήτε τέχνῃ μήτε μηχανῇ μηδεμιᾷ .
4th, "That it shall not be lawful to take the field for the purpose of inflicting injury, either for the Lacedaemonians and their allies against the Athenians and their allies, or for the Athenians and their allies against the Lacedaemonians and their allies, by any means whatever.


5.18.4
3499
ἢν δέ τι διάφορον ᾖ πρὸς ἀλλήλους , δικαίῳ χρήσθων καὶ ὅρκοις , καθ’ ὅτι ἂν ξυνθῶνται .
But should any dispute arise between them, they must have recourse to justice and oaths, in whatever way they may arrange.


5.18.5
3500
ἀποδόντων δὲ Ἀθηναίοις Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι Ἀμφίπολιν .
5th, "That the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall restore Amphipolis to the Athenians.


5.18.5
3501
ὅσας δὲ πόλεις παρέδοσαν Λακεδαιμόνιοι Ἀθηναίοις , ἐξέστω ἀπιέναι ὅποι ἂν βούλωνται αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰ ἑαυτῶν ἔχοντας ·
That of all the cities, however, which the Lacedaemonians may restore to the Athenians, the inhabitants shall be allowed to depart wherever they please, themselves and their property with them;


5.18.5
3502
τὰς δὲ πόλεις φερούσας τὸν φόρον τὸν ἐπ’ Ἀριστείδου αὐτονόμους εἶναι .
and the cities shall be independent, only paying the tribute that was paid in the time of Aristides.


5.18.5
3503
ὅπλα δὲ μὴ ἐξέστω ἐπιφέρειν Ἀθηναίους μηδὲ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐπὶ κακῷ , ἀποδιδόντων τὸν φόρον , ἐπειδὴ αἱ σπονδαὶ ἐγένοντο .
That it shall not be lawful for the Athenians, or their allies, to take the field against them for their injury, after the treaty has been concluded.


5.18.5
3504
εἰσὶ δὲ Ἄργιλος , Στάγιρος , Ἄκανθος , Σκῶλος , Ὄλυνθος , Σπάρτωλος .
The cities referred to are Argilus, Stagirus, Acanthus, Scolus, Olynthus, and Spartolus.


5.18.5
3505
ξυμμάχους δ’ εἶναι μηδετέρων , μήτε Λακεδαιμονίων μήτε Ἀθηναίων ·
That these shall be considered as allies to neither party, neither the Lacedaemonians nor the Athenians;


5.18.5
3506
ἢν δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι πείθωσι τὰς πόλεις , βουλομένας ταύτας ἐξέστω ξυμμάχους ποιεῖσθαι αὐτοὺς Ἀθηναίοις .
but if the Athenians gain the consent of the cities, then it shall be lawful for them to make them their allies, with their own free will.


5.18.6
3507
Μηκυβερναίους δὲ καὶ Σαναίους καὶ Σιγγαίους οἰκεῖν τὰς πόλεις τὰς ἑαυτῶν , καθάπερ Ὀλύνθιοι καὶ Ἀκάνθιοι .
6th, "That the Athenians, also, shall restore to the Lacedaemonians Coryphasium, Cythera, Methone, Pteleum, and Atalanta, and all the Lacedaemonians that are in prison at Athens, or any where else in all the Athenian dominions; and shall release those of the Peloponnesians who are being besieged in Scione; and all others in that place who are allies of the Lacedaemonians; and whoever amongst the allies of the Lacedaemonians is in prison at Athens, or any where else in the Athenian dominions.


5.18.7
3508
ἀποδόντων δὲ Ἀθηναίοις Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι Πάνακτον .
7th, "That the Lacedaemonians too, and their allies, shall in the same way restore whomever of the Athenians and their allies they may have in their hands.

ἀποδόντων δὲ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι Λακεδαιμονίοις Κορυφάσιον καὶ Κύθηρα καὶ Μέθανα καὶ Πτελεὸν καὶ Ἀταλάντην καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ὅσοι εἰσὶ Λακεδαιμονίων ἐν τῷ δημοσίῳ τῷ Ἀθηναίων ἢ ἄλλοθί που ὅσης Ἀθηναῖοι ἄρχουσιν ἐν δημοσίῳ ·
The Athenians shall restore Coryphasium, Cythera, Methana, Pteleum, and Atalanta, and all the men they have taken from the Lacedaemonians in any place whatsoever.


5.18.7
3510
καὶ τοὺς ἐν Σκιώνῃ πολιορκουμένους Πελοποννησίων ἀφεῖναι καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ὅσοι Λακεδαιμονίων ξύμμαχοι ἐν Σκιώνῃ εἰσὶ καὶ ὅσους Βρασίδας ἐσέπεμψε καὶ εἴ τις τῶν ξυμμάχων τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἐν Ἀθήναις ἐστὶν ἐν τῷ δημοσίῳ ἢ ἄλλοθί που ἧς Ἀθηναῖοι ἄρχουσιν ἐν δημοσίῳ .
They shall also withdraw their soldiers from Scione and give up the garrison there;


5.18.7
3511
ἀποδόντων δὲ καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι οὕστινας ἔχουσιν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων κατὰ τ- αὐτά .
and the Lacedaemonians shall likewise withdraw their troops and hand over to the Athenians any men they may have captured from them.


5.18.8
3512
Σκιωναίων δὲ καὶ Τορωναίων καὶ Σερμυλιῶν καὶ εἴ τινα ἄλλην πόλιν ἔχουσιν Ἀθηναῖοι , Ἀθηναίους βουλεύεσθαι περὶ αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ἄλλων πόλεων ὅτι ἂν δοκῇ αὐτοῖς .
8th, "That in the case of the Scionaeans, Toronaeans, and Sermylians, and whatever other city the Athenians have possession of, respecting these and the rest they shall adopt such measures as they please.


5.18.9
3513
ὅρκους δὲ ποιήσασθαι Ἀθηναίους πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους κατὰ πόλεις .
9th, "That the Athenians shall take the oaths to the Lacedaemonians and their allies, state by state;


5.18.9
3514
ὀμνύντων δὲ τὸν ἐπιχώριον ὅρκον ἑκάτεροι τὸν μέγιστον ἑπτὰ καὶ δέκα ἑκάστης πόλεως .
and that every man shall swear by the most binding oath of his country, according to his respective state.


5.18.9
3515
ὁ δ’ ὅρκος ἔστω ὅδε ·
That the oath must be to this effect:


5.18.9
3516
&quot; ἐμμενῶ ταῖς ξυνθήκαις καὶ ταῖς σπονδαῖς ταῖσδε δικαίως καὶ ἀδόλως &quot; .
'I will abide by these arrangements and articles of the treaty, honestly and without guile.'


5.18.9
3517
ἔστω δὲ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις κατὰ τ- αὐτὰ ὅρκος πρὸς Ἀθηναίους , τὸν δὲ ὅρκον ἀνανεοῦσθαι κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἀμφοτέρους .
That in the same way an oath shall be taken by the Lacedaemonians and their allies to the Athenians;


5.18.10
3518
στήλας δὲ στῆσαι Ὀλυμπίασι καὶ Πυθοῖ καὶ Ἰσθμοῖ καὶ Ἀθήνησιν ἐν πόλει καὶ ἐν Λακεδαίμονι ἐν Ἀμυκλαίῳ .
and that on both sides the oath shall be renewed yearly. That the contracting parties shall erect pillars at Olympia, Pythia, the Isthmus, at Athens in the citadel, and at Lacedaemon in the temple of Apollo at Amyclae.


5.18.11
3519
εἰ δέ τι ἀμνημονοῦσιν ὁποτεροιοῦν καὶ ὅτου πέρι , λόγοις δικαίοις χρωμένοις εὔορκον εἶναι ἀμφοτέροις ταύτῃ μεταθεῖναι ὅπῃ ἂν δοκῇ ἀμφοτέροις , Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις .
That if they forget any thing, whatever it may be, and on whatever point, it shall be consistent with their oaths for both parties, Athenians and Lacedaemonians, by means of fair discussion, to change it in such manner as they please.


5.19.1
3520
&quot; ἄρχει δὲ τῶν σπονδῶν ἐν μὲν Λακεδαίμονι ἔφορος Πλειστόλας Ἀρτεμισίου μηνὸς τετάρτῃ φθίνοντος , ἐν δὲ Ἀθήναις ἄρχων Ἀλκαῖος Ἐλαφηβολιῶνος μηνὸς ἕκτῃ φθίνοντος .
" The treaty commences from the ephoralty of Pleistolas, on the 27th of the month Artemisium, and from the archonship of Alcaeus at Athens, on the 25th of the month Elaphebolion.


5.19.1
3521
ὤμνυον δὲ οἵδε καὶ ἐσπένδοντο .
Those who took the oaths and subscribed the treaty were as follows:


5.19.2
3522
Λακεδαιμονίων μὲν Πλειστοάναξ , Ἆγις , Πλειστόλας , Δαμάγητος , Χίονις , Μεταγένης , Ἄκανθος , Δάιθος , Ἰσχαγόρας , Φιλοχαρίδας , Ζευξίδας , Ἄντιππος , Τέλλις , Ἀλκινάδας , Ἐμπεδίας , Μηνᾶς , Λάφιλος .
" on the side of the Lacedaemonians, [Pleistoanax, Agis,] Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Tellis, Alcinidas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus:

5.20.1
3525
αὗται αἱ σπονδαὶ ἐγένοντο τελευτῶντος τοῦ χειμῶνος ἅμα ἦρι , ἐκ Διονυσίων εὐθὺς τῶν ἀστικῶν , αὐτόδεκα ἐτῶν διελθόντων καὶ ἡμερῶν ὀλίγων παρενεγκουσῶν ἢ ὡς τὸ πρῶτον ἡ ἐσβολὴ ἡ ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ τοῦ πολέμου τοῦδε ἐγένετο .
This treaty was concluded at the end of the winter, when the spring was commencing, immediately after the city festival of Bacchus, when just ten years had elapsed with the variation of a few days, since the invasion of Attica was first made, and this war commenced.


5.20.2
3526
σκοπείτω δέ τις κατὰ τοὺς χρόνους καὶ μὴ τῶν ἑκασταχοῦ ἢ ἀρχόντων ἢ ἀπὸ τιμῆς τινὸς ἐς τὰ προγεγενημένα σημαινόντων τὴν ἀπαρίθμησιν τῶν ὀνομάτων πιστεύσας μᾶλλον .
But let every one regard this with reference to the periods of time,


5.20.2
3527
οὐ γὰρ ἀκριβές ἐστιν , οἷς καὶ ἀρχομένοις καὶ μεσοῦσι καὶ ὅπως ἔτυχέ τῳ ἐπεγένετό τι .
and not, as placing greater confidence in such a view, with respect to the enumeration of the public officers in the several places, or of the titles derived from any honourable appointment which serve to mark past events. For that gives no definite idea, as to who were in the commencement of their office, or in the middle of it, or whatever part it might be, when any event occurred.


5.20.3
3528
κατὰ θέρη δὲ καὶ χειμῶνας ἀριθμῶν , ὥσπερ γέγραπται , εὑρήσει , ἐξ ἡμισείας ἑκατέρου τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ τὴν δύναμιν ἔχοντος , δέκα μὲν θέρη , ἴσους δὲ χειμῶνας τῷ πρώτῳ πολέμῳ τῷδε γεγενημένους .
But if he reckon by summers and winters, as I have written my history, he will find that while each of these amounts to half a year, there were ten summers and as many winters included in this first war.


5.21.1
3529
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δέ ( ἔλαχον γὰρ πρότεροι ἀποδιδόναι ἃ εἶχον ) τούς τε ἄνδρας εὐθὺς τοὺς παρὰ σφίσιν αἰχμαλώτους ἀφίεσαν καὶ πέμψαντες ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης πρέσβεις Ἰσχαγόραν καὶ Μηνᾶν καὶ Φιλοχαρίδαν ἐκέλευον τὸν Κλεαρίδαν τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν παραδιδόναι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους τὰς σπονδάς , ὡς εἴρητο ἑκάστοις , δέχεσθαι .
Now the Lacedaemonians (for it fell to their lot to be the first to restore what they held) immediately released the men who were prisoners in their country; and sending as ambassadors to the countries Thrace-ward, Ischagoras, Menas, and Philocharidas, commanded Clearidas to restore Amphipolis to the Athenians, and the rest of the states to accept the treaty, as it had been severally arranged for them.


5.21.2
3530
οἱ δ’ οὐκ ἤθελον , νομίζοντες οὐκ ἐπιτηδείας εἶναι ·
They, however, would not, as they thought it not favourable to them;


5.21.2
3531
οὐδὲ ὁ Κλεαρίδας παρέδωκε τὴν πόλιν , χαριζόμενος τοῖς Χαλκιδεῦσι , λέγων ὡς οὐ δυνατὸς εἴη βίᾳ ἐκείνων παραδιδόναι .
nor did Clearidas restore the city, wishing to oblige the Chalcidians, and declaring that he could not give it up in opposition to them.


5.21.3
3532
ἐλθὼν δὲ αὐτὸς κατὰ τάχος μετὰ πρέσβεων αὐτόθεν ἀπολογησόμενός τε ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα , ἢν κατηγορῶσιν οἱ περὶ τὸν Ἰσχαγόραν ὅτι οὐκ ἐπείθετο , καὶ ἅμα βουλόμενος εἰδέναι εἰ ἔτι μετακινητὴ εἴη ἡ ὁμολογία , ἐπειδὴ ηὗρε κατειλημμένους , αὐτὸς μὲν πάλιν πεμπόντων τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ κελευόντων μάλιστα μὲν καὶ τὸ χωρίον παραδοῦναι , εἰ δὲ μή , ὁπόσοι Πελοποννησίων ἔνεισιν ἐξαγαγεῖν , κατὰ τάχος ἐπορεύετο .
He, however, went in haste to Lacedaemon with ambassadors from that place, to defend himself, if Ischagoras and his party should bring any charge against him for not obeying; and at the same time from a wish to know whether the arrangement might still be altered: but when he found the treaty secured, being sent back again himself by the Lacedaemonians, and ordered to deliver up the place, if possible, but if not, to bring out all the Peloponnesians that were in it, he set out with all speed.


5.22.1
3533
οἱ δὲ ξύμμαχοι ἐν τῇ Λακεδαίμονι αὐτοὶ ἔτυχον ὄντες , καὶ αὐτῶν τοὺς μὴ δεξαμένους τὰς σπονδὰς ἐκέλευον οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ποιεῖσθαι .
Now the allies happened themselves to be at Lacedaemon, and those of them who had not accepted the treaty were commanded by the Lacedaemonians to adopt it.


5.22.1
3534
οἱ δὲ τῇ αὐτῇ προφάσει ᾗπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἀπεώσαντο οὐκ ἔφασαν δέξεσθαι , ἢν μή τινας δικαιοτέρας τούτων ποιῶνται .
They, however, on the same grounds as they had at first rejected it, refused to accept it, unless they made a more equitable one than that.


5.22.2
3535
ὡς δ’ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐσήκουον , ἐκείνους μὲν ἀπέπεμψαν , αὐτοὶ δὲ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ξυμμαχίαν ἐποιοῦντο , νομίζοντες ἥκιστα ἂν σφίσι τούς τε Ἀργείους , ἐπειδὴ οὐκ ἤθελον Ἀμπελίδου καὶ Λίχου ἐλθόντων ἐπισπένδεσθαι νομίσαντες αὐτοὺς ἄνευ Ἀθηναίων οὐ δεινοὺς εἶναι , καὶ τὴν ἄλλην Πελοπόννησον μάλιστ’ ἂν ἡσυχάζειν ·
So when they did not listen to them, they sent them away, and themselves proceeded to conclude an alliance with the Athenians;


5.22.2
3536
πρὸς γὰρ ἂν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , εἰ ἐξῆν , χωρεῖν .
thinking that the Argives (since they refused, on Ampelidas and Lichas going to them, to make a fresh treaty) would be by no means formidable without the support of the Athenians, and that the rest of the Peloponnese would be most disposed to remain quiet; whereas they would have gone over to the Athenians, if they had had the power.


5.22.3
3537
παρόντων οὖν πρέσβεων ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ γενομένων λόγων ξυνέβησαν , καὶ ἐγένοντο ὅρκοι καὶ ξυμμαχία ἥδε .
Ambassadors, therefore, having come from the Athenians, and a conference having been held, they came to an agreement, and oaths were taken, and this alliance concluded, on the following terms:


5.23.1
3538
&quot; κατὰ τάδε ξύμμαχοι ἔσονται Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι πεντήκοντα ἔτη .
"The Lacedaemonians shall be allies of the Athenians for fifty years.


5.23.1
3539
ἢν δέ τινες ἴωσιν ἐς τὴν γῆν πολέμιοι τὴν Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ κακῶς ποιῶσι Λακεδαιμονίους , ὠφελεῖν Ἀθηναίους Λακεδαιμονίους τρόπῳ ὁποίῳ ἂν δύνωνται ἰσχυροτάτῳ κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν ·
2nd, "That should any come as enemies against the territory of the Lacedaemonians, and do them injury, the Athenians shall assist them in such manner as they can most efficiently, to the utmost of their power.


5.23.1
3540
ἢν δὲ δῃώσαντες οἴχωνται , πολεμίαν εἶναι ταύτην τὴν πόλιν Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις καὶ κακῶς πάσχειν ὑπὸ ἀμφοτέρων , καταλύειν δὲ ἅμα ἄμφω τὼ πόλεε .
That should they have ravaged the land and departed, that state shall be considered as hostile to the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, and be punished by both of them; and that both states shall make peace at the same time.


5.23.1
3541
ταῦτα δ’ εἶναι δικαίως καὶ προθύμως καὶ ἀδόλως .
That these conditions shall be observed honestly, heartily, and sincerely.


5.23.2
3542
καὶ ἤν τινες ἐς τὴν Ἀθηναίων γῆν ἴωσι πολέμιοι καὶ κακῶς ποιῶσιν Ἀθηναίους , ὠφελεῖν Λακεδαιμονίους Ἀθηναίους τρόπῳ ὅτῳ ἂν δύνωνται ἰσχυροτάτῳ κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν ·
3rd, "That, again, should any come as enemies against the country of the Athenians, and injure them, the Lacedaemonians shall assist them in whatever manner they can most efficiently, to the utmost of their power.


5.23.2
3543
ἢν δὲ δῃώσαντες οἴχωνται , πολεμίαν εἶναι ταύτην τὴν πόλιν Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις καὶ κακῶς πάσχειν ὑπ’ ἀμφοτέρων , καταλύειν δὲ ἅμα ἄμφω τὼ πόλεε .
That should they have ravaged the land and departed, that state shall be considered as hostile to the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, and punished by both of them; and that both states shall make peace at the same time.


5.23.3
3544
ταῦτα δ’ εἶναι δικαίως καὶ προθύμως καὶ ἀδόλως .
That these conditions shall be observed honestly, heartily, and sincerely.


5.23.3
3545
ἢν δὲ ἡ δουλεία ἐπανιστῆται , ἐπικουρεῖν Ἀθηναίους Λακεδαιμονίοις παντὶ σθένει κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν .
That should the slave population rise up against them, the Athenians shall assist the Lacedaemonians with all their might, according to their ability.


5.23.4
3546
ὀμοῦνται δὲ ταῦτα οἵπερ καὶ τὰς ἄλλας σπονδὰς ὤμνυον ἑκατέρων .
That these articles shall be sworn to by the same persons as swore to the other treaty, on both sides.


5.23.4
3547
ἀνανεοῦσθαι δὲ τὸν ὅρκον κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν Λακεδαιμονίους μὲν ἰόντας ἐς Ἀθήνας πρὸς τὰ Διονύσια , Ἀθηναίους δὲ ἰόντας ἐς Λακεδαίμονα πρὸς τὰ Ὑακίνθια .
That they shall be renewed every year, by the Lacedaemonians going to Athens at the Dionysian festival, and by the Athenians going to Lacedaemon at the Hyacinthian.


5.23.5
3548
στήλην δὲ ἑκατέρους στῆσαι , τὴν μὲν ἐν Λακεδαίμονι παρ’ Ἀπόλλωνι ἐν Ἀμυκλαίῳ , τὴν δὲ ἐν Ἀθήναις ἐν πόλει παρ’ Ἀθηνᾷ .
"That they shall each erect a pillar, that at Lacedaemon near the statue of Apollo in the Amyclaeum, and that at Athens in the citadel, near"


5.23.6
3549
ἢν δέ τι δοκῇ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις προσθεῖναι καὶ ἀφελεῖν περὶ τῆς ξυμμαχίας , ὅτι ἂν δοκῇ , εὔορκον ἀμφοτέροις εἶναι .
" the statue of Minerva. That should the Lacedaemonians and Athenians choose to add to, or take away from, these terms of alliance, whatever they please so to do shall be consistent with the oaths of both parties."


5.24.1
3550
&quot; τὸν δὲ ὅρκον ὤμνυον Λακεδαιμονίων μὲν οἵδε , Πλειστοάναξ , Ἆγις , Πλειστόλας , Δαμάγητος , Χίονις , Μεταγένης , Ἄκανθος , Δάιθος , Ἰσχαγόρας , Φιλοχαρίδας , Ζευξίδας , Ἄντιππος , Ἀλκινάδας , Τέλλις , Ἐμπεδίας , Μηνᾶς , Λάφιλος , Ἀθηναίων δὲ Λάμπων , Ἰσθμιόνικος , Λάχης , Νικίας , Εὐθύδημος , Προκλῆς , Πυθόδωρος , Ἅγνων , Μυρτίλος , Θρασυκλῆς , Θεαγένης , Ἀριστοκράτης , Ἰώλκιος , Τιμοκράτης , Λέων , Λάμαχος , Δημοσθένης &quot; .
The oath was sworn by the following on the side of the Lacedaemonians: Pleistoanax, Agis, Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Alcinadas, Tellis, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus: and on the side of the Athenians, by Lampon, Isthmionicus, Laches, Nicias, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, Theogenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes This alliance was entered into not long after the treaty, and the Athenians restored to the Lacedaemonians the men taken from the


5.24.2
3551
αὕτη ἡ ξυμμαχία ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰς σπονδὰς οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον , καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἐκ τῆς νήσου ἀπέδοσαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις , καὶ τὸ θέρος ἦρχε τοῦ ἑνδεκάτου ἔτους .
This alliance was made not long after the truce, and the Athenians gave up the men from the island to the Lacedaemonians; and thus began the summer of the eleventh year.


5.24.2
3552
ταῦτα δὲ τὰ δέκα ἔτη ὁ πρῶτος πόλεμος ξυνεχῶς γενόμενος γέγραπται .
During these ten years, then, the first war was carried on continuously, and such is the history of it.


5.25.1
3553
μετὰ δὲ τὰς σπονδὰς καὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , αἳ ἐγένοντο μετὰ τὸν δεκέτη πόλεμον ἐπὶ Πλειστόλα μὲν ἐν Λακεδαίμονι ἐφόρου , Ἀλκαίου δ’ ἄρχοντος Ἀθήνησι , τοῖς μὲν δεξαμένοις αὐτὰς εἰρήνη ἦν , οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι καὶ τῶν ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ πόλεών τινες διεκίνουν τὰ πεπραγμένα , καὶ εὐθὺς ἄλλη ταραχὴ καθίστατο τῶν ξυμμάχων πρὸς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα .
After the treaty, and the alliance between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, which were concluded at the end of the ten years' war, in the ephoralty of Pleistolas at Lacedaemon, and the archonship of Alcaeus at Athens, those who had acceded to them were at peace; but the Corinthians, and some of the states in the Peloponnese, were trying to alter what had been done; and another disturbance immediately arose on the part of the allies against Lacedaemon.


5.25.2
3554
καὶ ἅμα καὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι προϊόντος τοῦ χρόνου ὕποπτοι ἐγένοντο ἔστιν ἐν οἷς οὐ ποιοῦντες ἐκ τῶν ξυγκειμένων ἃ εἴρητο .
Moreover, the Lacedaemonians, as time went on, became suspected by the Athenians also, through not performing in some respects what had been agreed on, according to the treaty.


5.25.3
3555
καὶ ἐπὶ ἓξ ἔτη μὲν καὶ δέκα μῆνας ἀπέσχοντο μὴ ἐπὶ τὴν ἑκατέρων γῆν στρατεῦσαι , ἔξωθεν δὲ μετ’ ἀνοκωχῆς οὐ βεβαίου ἔβλαπτον ἀλλήλους τὰ μάλιστα ·
And though for six years and ten months they abstained from marching against each other's territory, yet out of it, during the existence of a doubtful suspension of arms, they were doing one another the greatest possible damage.


5.25.3
3556
ἔπειτα μέντοι καὶ ἀναγκασθέντες λῦσαι τὰς μετὰ τὰ δέκα ἔτη σπονδὰς αὖθις ἐς πόλεμον φανερὸν κατέστησαν .
Subsequently, however, they were compelled to break the treaty concluded after the ten years' war, and again proceeded to open hostilities.


5.26.1
3557
γέγραφε δὲ καὶ ταῦτα ὁ αὐτὸς Θουκυδίδης Ἀθηναῖος ἑξῆς , ὡς ἕκαστα ἐγένετο , κατὰ θέρη καὶ χειμῶνας , μέχρι οὗ τήν τε ἀρχὴν κατέπαυσαν τῶν Ἀθηναίων Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι , καὶ τὰ μακρὰ τείχη καὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ κατέλαβον .
And the same Thucydides the Athenian has also written the history of these transactions in order, as they severally happened, by summers and winters, until the Lacedaemonians and their allies put an end to the sovereignty of the Athenians, and took the long walls and Piraeus.


5.26.1
3558
ἔτη δὲ ἐς τοῦτο τὰ ξύμπαντα ἐγένετο τῷ πολέμῳ ἑπτὰ καὶ εἴκοσι .
To the time of that event there were spent in the war seven and twenty years in all.


5.26.2
3559
καὶ τὴν διὰ μέσου ξύμβασιν εἴ τις μὴ ἀξιώσει πόλεμον νομίζειν , οὐκ ὀρθῶς δικαιώσει .
For let him regard it as it is characterized by the facts of the case, and he will find that there is no reason for its being deemed a state of peace;


5.26.2
3560
τοῖς τε γὰρ ἔργοις ὡς διῄρηται ἀθρείτω , καὶ εὑρήσει οὐκ εἰκὸς ὂν εἰρήνην αὐτὴν κριθῆναι , ἐν ᾗ οὔτε ἀπέδοσαν πάντα οὔτ’ ἀπεδέξαντο ἃ ξυνέθεντο , ἔξω τε τούτων πρὸς τὸν Μαντινικὸν καὶ Ἐπιδαύριον πόλεμον καὶ ἐς ἄλλα ἀμφοτέροις ἁμαρτήματα ἐγένοντο καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ξύμμαχοι οὐδὲν ἧσσον πολέμιοι ἦσαν Βοιωτοί τε ἐκεχειρίαν δεχήμερον ἦγον .
since during it they neither gave nor received back all they had arranged to do; and besides this, there were offences committed on both sides, as in the case of the Mantinean and Epidaurian wars, and other instances; and the Thrace-ward allies were in no respect less at war than before; while the Boeotians had only a truce from one ten days to another.


5.26.3
3561
ὥστε ξὺν τῷ πρώτῳ πολέμῳ τῷ δεκέτει καὶ τῇ μετ’ αὐτὸν ὑπόπτῳ ἀνοκωχῇ καὶ τῷ ὕστερον ἐξ αὐτῆς πολέμῳ εὑρήσει τις τοσαῦτα ἔτη , λογιζόμενος κατὰ τοὺς χρόνους , καὶ ἡμέρας οὐ πολλὰς παρενεγκούσας , καὶ τοῖς ἀπὸ χρησμῶν τι ἰσχυρισαμένοις μόνον δὴ τοῦτο ἐχυρῶς ξυμβάν .
Including, therefore, the first war of ten years, the suspicious cessation of hostilities which followed it, and the subsequent war which succeeded to that, any one will find that the number of years was what I have mentioned, (reckoning by the great divisions of time,) with only a few days' difference; and that such as positively asserted any thing on the strength of oracles, found this the only fact which proved true.


5.26.4
3562
αἰεὶ γὰρ ἔγωγε μέμνημαι , καὶ ἀρχομένου τοῦ πολέμου καὶ μέχρι οὗ ἐτελεύτησε , προφερόμενον ὑπὸ πολλῶν ὅτι τρὶς ἐννέα ἔτη δέοι γενέσθαι αὐτόν .
At least I, for my own part, remember that all along, both at the beginning of the war, and till it was brought to a conclusion, it was alleged by many that it was to last thrice nine years.


5.26.5
3563
ἐπεβίων δὲ διὰ παντὸς αὐτοῦ αἰσθανόμενός τε τῇ ἡλικίᾳ καὶ προσέχων τὴν γνώμην , ὅπως ἀκριβές τι εἴσομαι ·
And I lived on through the whole of it, being of an age to comprehend events, and paying attention, in order to gain accurate knowledge on each point.


5.26.5
3564
καὶ ξυνέβη μοι φεύγειν τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ ἔτη εἴκοσι μετὰ τὴν ἐς Ἀμφίπολιν στρατηγίαν , καὶ γενομένῳ παρ’ ἀμφοτέροις τοῖς πράγμασι , καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον τοῖς Πελοποννησίων διὰ τὴν φυγήν , καθ’ ἡσυχίαν τι αὐτῶν μᾶλλον αἰσθέσθαι .
It was also my lot to be banished my country twenty years after my command at Amphipolis; and thus, by being present at the transactions of either party, and especially of the Peloponnesians, in consequence of my banishment, to gain at my leisure a more perfect acquaintance with each of them.


5.26.6
3565
τὴν οὖν μετὰ τὰ δέκα ἔτη διαφοράν τε καὶ ξύγχυσιν τῶν σπονδῶν καὶ τὰ ἔπειτα ὡς ἐπολεμήθη ἐξηγήσομαι .
The difference, then, which arose after the ten years, and the breaking up of the treaty, and the subsequent course of hostilities, I will now relate.


5.27.1
3566
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ αἱ πεντηκοντούτεις σπονδαὶ ἐγένοντο καὶ ὕστερον ἡ ξυμμαχία , καὶ αἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου πρεσβεῖαι , αἵπερ παρεκλήθησαν ἐς αὐτά , ἀνεχώρουν ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος ·
When, then, the fifty years' treaty had been concluded, and the alliance afterwards, the embassies from the Peloponnese, which had been summoned for that business, returned from Lacedaemon. Accordingly the rest went home;


5.27.2
3567
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀπῆλθον , Κορίνθιοι δὲ ἐς Ἄργος τραπόμενοι πρῶτον λόγους ποιοῦνται πρός τινας τῶν ἐν τέλει ὄντων Ἀργείων ὡς χρή , ἐπειδὴ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὐκ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ καταδουλώσει τῆς Πελοποννήσου σπονδὰς καὶ ξυμμαχίαν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους τοὺς πρὶν ἐχθίστους πεποίηνται , ὁρᾶν τοὺς Ἀργείους ὅπως σωθήσεται ἡ Πελοπόννησος καὶ ψηφίσασθαι τὴν βουλομένην πόλιν τῶν Ἑλλήνων , ἥτις αὐτόνομός τέ ἐστι καὶ δίκας ἴσας καὶ ὁμοίας δίδωσι , πρὸς Ἀργείους ξυμμαχίαν ποιεῖσθαι ὥστε τῇ ἀλλήλων ἐπιμαχεῖν , ἀποδεῖξαι δὲ ἄνδρας ὀλίγους ἀρχὴν αὐτοκράτορας καὶ μὴ πρὸς τὸν δῆμον τοὺς λόγους εἶναι , τοῦ μὴ καταφανεῖς γίγνεσθαι τοὺς μὴ πείσαντας τὸ πλῆθος ·
But the Corinthians repaired to Argos, and in the first place held communications with some of the Argives who were in office, to the effect that, since the Lacedaemonians, not for the good, but for the subjugation of the Peloponnese, had entered into treaty and alliance with the Athenians, who were before their bitterest enemies; the Argives ought to consider how the Peloponnese might be preserved;


5.27.2
3568
ἔφασαν δὲ πολλοὺς προσχωρήσεσθαι μίσει τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων .
and to pass a decree, that any city of the Greeks that wished, being independent, and giving judicial satisfaction for wrongs, on fair and equal terms, might enter into alliance with the Argives, on condition of defending each other's country: and that they should appoint a few persons as commissioners with full powers, instead of the discussion of the measure being held before the people; in order that those might not be known who had failed to persuade the multitude. And they asserted that many would come over to them for hatred of the Lacedaemonians.


5.27.3
3569
καὶ οἱ μὲν Κορίνθιοι διδάξαντες ταῦτα ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου ·
The Corinthians then, having suggested these things, returned home.


5.28.1
3570
οἱ δὲ τῶν Ἀργείων ἄνδρες ἀκούσαντες ἐπειδὴ ἀνήνεγκαν τοὺς λόγους ἔς τε τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ τὸν δῆμον , ἐψηφίσαντο Ἀργεῖοι καὶ ἄνδρας εἵλοντο δώδεκα , πρὸς οὓς τὸν βουλόμενον τῶν Ἑλλήνων ξυμμαχίαν ποιεῖσθαι πλὴν Ἀθηναίων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων ·
When those of the Argives who heard their proposals had reported them to the government and the people, the Argives passed the decree, and chose twelve men, with whom any one of the Greeks who wished should conclude an alliance, except the Athenians and Lacedaemonians,


5.28.1
3571
τούτων δὲ μηδετέροις ἐξεῖναι ἄνευ τοῦ δήμου τοῦ Ἀργείων σπείσασθαι .
neither of whom should have liberty to enter into treaty without the consent of the Argive people.


5.28.2
3572
ἐδέξαντό τε ταῦτα οἱ Ἀργεῖοι μᾶλλον ὁρῶντες τόν τε Λακεδαιμονίων σφίσι πόλεμον ἐσόμενον ( ἐπ’ ἐξόδῳ γὰρ πρὸς αὐτοὺς αἱ σπονδαὶ ἦσαν ) καὶ ἅμα ἐλπίσαντες τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἡγήσεσθαι ·
The Argives acceded the more readily to these proposals, because they saw that they should have the war with the Lacedaemonians, (for their treaty with them was on the point of expiring,) and also because they hoped to gain the supremacy of the Peloponnese.


5.28.2
3573
κατὰ γὰρ τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον ἥ τε Λακεδαίμων μάλιστα δὴ κακῶς ἤκουσε καὶ ὑπερώφθη διὰ τὰς ξυμφοράς , οἵ τε Ἀργεῖοι ἄριστα ἔσχον τοῖς πᾶσιν , οὐ ξυναράμενοι τοῦ Ἀττικοῦ πολέμου , ἀμφοτέροις δὲ μᾶλλον ἔνσπονδοι ὄντες ἐκκαρπωσάμενοι .
For at that time Lacedaemon was in very bad repute, and was despised in consequence of its misfortunes; while the Argives were in an excellent condition in all respects, as they had taken no part in the war against Athens, but had rather reaped the good fruits of having been in treaty with both sides.


5.28.3
3574
οἱ μὲν οὖν Ἀργεῖοι οὕτως ἐς τὴν ξυμμαχίαν προσεδέχοντο τοὺς ἐθέλοντας τῶν Ἑλλήνων ,
Thus, then, the Argives were admitting into alliance such of the Greeks as wished it.


5.29.1
3575
Μαντινῆς δ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι αὐτῶν πρῶτοι προσεχώρησαν , δεδιότες τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους .
The Mantineans and their allies were the first to join them, through fear of the Lacedaemonians.


5.29.1
3576
τοῖς γὰρ Μαντινεῦσι μέρος τι τῆς Ἀρκαδίας κατέστραπτο ὑπήκοον ἔτι τοῦ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους πολέμου ὄντος , καὶ ἐνόμιζον οὐ περιόψεσθαι σφᾶς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἄρχειν , ἐπειδὴ καὶ σχολὴν ἦγον ·
For a certain part of Arcadia had been reduced to subjection by the Mantineans, while the war with the Athenians was still going on; and they thought that the Lacedaemonians would not allow their sovereignty over it, since they had now leisure to interfere;


5.29.1
3577
ὥστε ἄσμενοι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους ἐτράποντο , πόλιν τε μεγάλην νομίζοντες καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις αἰεὶ διάφορον , δημοκρατουμένην τε ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτοί .
so that they gladly turned to the Argives, considering them to be a powerful state, and one which was always at variance with the Lacedaemonians, and under a democratical government like themselves.


5.29.2
3578
ἀποστάντων δὲ τῶν Μαντινέων καὶ ἡ ἄλλη Πελοπόννησος ἐς θροῦν καθίστατο ὡς καὶ σφίσι ποιητέον τοῦτο , νομίσαντες πλέον τέ τι εἰδότας μεταστῆναι αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἅμα δι’ ὀργῆς ἔχοντες , ἐν ἄλλοις τε καὶ ὅτι ἐν ταῖς σπονδαῖς ταῖς Ἀττικαῖς ἐγέγραπτο εὔορκον εἶναι προσθεῖναι καὶ ἀφελεῖν ὅτι ἂν ἀμφοῖν τοῖν πολέοιν δοκῇ , Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις .
When the Mantineans had revolted, the rest of the Peloponnese also was thrown into commotion, with the idea that they too ought to do the same; as they thought that they had changed sides through knowing more than the rest. At the same time they were angry with the Lacedaemonians, both on other grounds, and because it had been mentioned in the treaty with Athens, that it should be consistent with their oaths to add to it, or take from it, whatever might seem fit to both states, the Lacedaemonians and Athenians.


5.29.3
3579
τοῦτο γὰρ τὸ γράμμα μάλιστα τὴν Πελοπόννησον διεθορύβει καὶ ἐς ὑποψίαν καθίστη μὴ μετὰ Ἀθηναίων σφᾶς βούλωνται Λακεδαιμόνιοι δουλώσασθαι ·
For it was this clause, above all, that caused the excitement in the Peloponnese, and set them on suspecting that the Lacedaemonians, in concert with the Athenians, might wish to reduce them to slavery:


5.29.3
3580
δίκαιον γὰρ εἶναι πᾶσι τοῖς ξυμμάχοις γεγράφθαι τὴν μετάθεσιν .
for it was only just, they thought, that the alteration should have been referred to all the allies.


5.29.4
3581
ὥστε φοβούμενοι οἱ πολλοὶ ὥρμηντο πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους καὶ αὐτοὶ ἕκαστοι ξυμμαχίαν ποιεῖσθαι .
The majority therefore, through fear, were eager to conclude the alliance with the Argives on their own part, respectively, as the Mantineans had done.


5.30.1
3582
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ αἰσθόμενοι τὸν θροῦν τοῦτον ἐν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ καθεστῶτα καὶ τοὺς Κορινθίους διδασκάλους τε γενομένους καὶ αὐτοὺς μέλλοντας σπείσεσθαι πρὸς τὸ Ἄργος , πέμπουσι πρέσβεις ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον βουλόμενοι προκαταλαβεῖν τὸ μέλλον , καὶ ᾐτιῶντο τήν τε ἐσήγησιν τοῦ παντὸς καὶ εἰ Ἀργείοις σφῶν ἀποστάντες ξύμμαχοι ἔσονται , παραβήσεσθαί τε ἔφασαν αὐτοὺς τοὺς ὅρκους , καὶ ἤδη ἀδικεῖν ὅτι οὐ δέχονται τὰς Ἀθηναίων σπονδάς , εἰρημένον κύριον εἶναι ὅτι ἂν τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ξυμμάχων ψηφίσηται , ἢν μή τι θεῶν ἢ ἡρώων κώλυμα ᾖ .
When the Lacedaemonians perceived this commotion which had arisen in the Peloponnese, and that the Corinthians were the advisers of it, and were themselves about to enter into treaty with Argos, they sent ambassadors to Corinth, wishing to prevent what was going to happen. They charged them therefore with suggesting the whole business; and said that if they withdrew from them, and became allies of the Argives, they would violate their oaths; and that they were already doing wrong in not accepting the treaty with the Athenians, when it had been declared, that whatever the majority of the allies decreed, should be binding, unless there were some impediment on the part of gods or heroes.


5.30.2
3583
Κορίνθιοι δὲ παρόντων σφίσι τῶν ξυμμάχων ὅσοι οὐδ’ αὐτοὶ ἐδέξαντο τὰς σπονδάς ( παρεκάλεσαν δὲ αὐτοὺς αὐτοὶ πρότερον ) , ἀντέλεγον τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις , ἃ μὲν ἠδικοῦντο οὐ δηλοῦντες ἄντικρυς , ὅτι οὔτε Σόλλιον σφίσιν ἀπέλαβον παρ’ Ἀθηναίων οὔτε Ἀνακτόριον εἴ τέ τι ἄλλο ἐνόμιζον ἐλασσοῦσθαι , πρόσχημα δὲ ποιούμενοι τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης μὴ προδώσειν ·
The Corinthians, in the presence of all the allies who, like themselves, had not acceded to the treaty, (for they had themselves previously invited them thither,) spoke in reply to the Lacedaemonians;


5.30.2
3584
ὀμόσαι γὰρ αὐτοῖς ὅρκους ἰδίᾳ τε , ὅτε μετὰ Ποτειδεατῶν τὸ πρῶτον ἀφίσταντο , καὶ ἄλλους ὕστερον .
not indeed directly stating the injuries they had received, namely, that they had not recovered Sollium from the Athenians, nor Anactorium—with any other point on which they considered themselves to be aggrieved; but urging as a pretext their determination not to betray the Thrace-ward Greeks; for they had taken oaths to them, both by themselves, when in the first instance they revolted, in concert with the Potidaeans, and others afterwards.


5.30.3
3585
οὔκουν παραβαίνειν τοὺς τῶν ξυμμάχων ὅρκους ἔφασαν οὐκ ἐσιόντες ἐς τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων σπονδάς ·
They were not then, they said, violating their oaths to the allies by refusing to accede to the treaty with the Athenians;


5.30.3
3586
θεῶν γὰρ πίστεις ὀμόσαντες ἐκείνοις οὐκ ἂν εὐορκεῖν προδιδόντες αὐτούς .
for since they had sworn to their Thrace-ward friends, with appeals to the gods, they should not show a proper regard for their oaths, if they betrayed them.


5.30.3
3587
εἰρῆσθαι δ’ ὅτι &quot; ἢν μὴ θεῶν ἢ ἡρώων κώλυμα ᾖ ·’ φαίνεσθαι οὖν σφίσι κώλυμα θεῖον τοῦτο .
Besides, it had been expressly mentioned, "unless there were some impediment on the part of gods or heroes;"


5.30.4
3588
καὶ περὶ μὲν τῶν παλαιῶν ὅρκων τοσαῦτα εἶπον , περὶ δὲ τῆς Ἀργείων ξυμμαχίας μετὰ τῶν φίλων βουλευσάμενοι ποιήσειν ὅτι ἂν δίκαιον ᾖ .
this, then, they considered an impediment on the part of the gods. Thus much they said on the subject of their former oaths: with regard to the Argive alliance, they would consult with their friends, and do whatever was right.


5.30.5
3589
καὶ οἱ μὲν Λακεδαιμονίων πρέσβεις ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου ·
So the envoys of the Lacedaemonians returned home.


5.30.5
3590
ἔτυχον δὲ παρόντες ἐν Κορίνθῳ καὶ Ἀργείων πρέσβεις , οἳ ἐκέλευον τοὺς Κορινθίους ἰέναι ἐς τὴν ξυμμαχίαν καὶ μὴ μέλλειν ·
But there happened to be in Corinth at that time some ambassadors from the Argives also, who urged the Corinthians to enter at once into their confederacy, and not delay.


5.30.5
3591
οἱ δὲ ἐς τὸν ὕστερον ξύλλογον αὐτοῖς τὸν παρὰ σφίσι προεῖπον ἥκειν .
They, however, told them to come to the next congress which was to be held in their city.


5.31.1
3592
ἦλθε δὲ καὶ Ἠλείων πρεσβεία εὐθὺς καὶ ἐποιήσατο πρὸς Κορινθίους ξυμμαχίαν πρῶτον , ἔπειτα ἐκεῖθεν ἐς Ἄργος ἐλθόντες , καθάπερ προείρητο , Ἀργείων ξύμμαχοι ἐγένοντο .
Immediately after, there came also an embassy from the Eleans, who concluded an alliance with the Corinthians in the first place,


5.31.1
3593
διαφερόμενοι γὰρ ἐτύγχανον τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις περὶ Λεπρέου .
and then proceeded thence to Argos, as they had been previously instructed, and became allies of the Argives. For they were at variance with the Lacedaemonians just then about Lepreum.


5.31.2
3594
πολέμου γὰρ γενομένου ποτὲ πρὸς Ἀρκάδων τινὰς Λεπρεάταις καὶ Ἠλείων παρακληθέντων ὑπὸ Λεπρεατῶν ἐς ξυμμαχίαν ἐπὶ τῇ ἡμισείᾳ τῆς γῆς καὶ λυσάντων τὸν πόλεμον Ἠλεῖοι τὴν γῆν νεμομένοις αὐτοῖς τοῖς Λεπρεάταις τάλαντον ἔταξαν τῷ Διὶ τῷ Ὀλυμπίῳ ἀποφέρειν .
For a war having before this arisen between the Lepreans and some of the Arcadians, and the Eleans having been invited to alliance by the Lepreans, on condition of receiving half their territory, and having brought the war to a conclusion, the Eleans imposed on the Lepreans, who were themselves allowed to occupy the territory, the payment of a talent to the Olympian Jupiter.


5.31.3
3595
καὶ μέχρι μὲν τοῦ Ἀττικοῦ πολέμου ἀπέφερον , ἔπειτα παυσαμένων διὰ πρόφασιν τοῦ πολέμου οἱ Ἠλεῖοι ἐπηνάγκαζον , οἱ δ’ ἐτράποντο πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους .
This they continued to pay till the Attic war broke out;


5.31.3
3596
καὶ δίκης Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐπιτραπείσης ὑποτοπήσαντες οἱ Ἠλεῖοι μὴ ἴσον ἕξειν ἀνέντες τὴν ἐπιτροπὴν Λερεατῶν τὴν γῆν ἔτεμον .
when, on their ceasing to do so on the pretext of the war, the Eleans proceeded to compel them; on which they had recourse to the Lacedaemonians. When the case was thus submitted to the arbitration of the Lacedaemonians, the Eleans, suspecting that they should not have justice, renounced the reference, and laid waste the Leprean territory.


5.31.4
3597
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὐδὲν ἧσσον ἐδίκασαν αὐτονόμους εἶναι Λεπρεάτας καὶ ἀδικεῖν Ἠλείους , καὶ ὡς οὐκ ἐμμεινάντων τῇ ἐπιτροπῇ φρουρὰν ὁπλιτῶν ἐσέπεμψαν ἐς Λέπρεον .
The Lacedaemonians nevertheless decided that the Lepreans were independent, and that the Eleans were acting with injustice; and inasmuch as they had not stood by the arbitration, they sent into Lepreum a garrison of heavy-armed troops.


5.31.5
3598
οἱ δὲ Ἠλεῖοι νομίζοντες πόλιν σφῶν ἀφεστηκυῖαν δέξασθαι τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τὴν ξυνθήκην προφέροντες ἐν ᾗ εἴρητο , ἃ ἔχοντες ἐς τὸν Ἀττικὸν πόλεμον καθίσταντό τινες , ταῦτα ἔχοντας καὶ ἐξελθεῖν , ὡς οὐκ ἴσον ἔχοντες ἀφίστανται πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους , καὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν , ὥσπερ προείρητο , καὶ οὗτοι ἐποιήσαντο .
So the Eleans, considering the Lacedaemonians to be receiving a city which had revolted from them, and alleging the agreement in which it had been declared, that whatever each party had when they entered on the Attic war, that they should also have when they retired from it; since they considered that they had not their due, they went over to the Argives; and thus they too, as they had been previously instructed, concluded the alliance.


5.31.6
3599
ἐγένοντο δὲ καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι εὐθὺς μετ’ ἐκείνους καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης Χαλκιδῆς Ἀργείων ξύμμαχοι .
Immediately after them the Corinthians and Thrace-ward Chalcidians also entered into alliance with the Argives;


5.31.6
3600
Βοιωτοὶ δὲ καὶ Μεγαρῆς τὸ αὐτὸ λέγοντες ἡσύχαζον , περιορώμενοι ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ νομίζοντες σφίσι τὴν Ἀργείων δημοκρατίαν αὐτοῖς ὀλιγαρχουμένοις ἧσσον ξύμφορον εἶναι τῆς Λακεδαιμονίων πολιτείας .
but the Boeotians and Megareans, holding each the same language as the other, remained quiet; being neglected by the Lacedaemonians, and yet thinking that the democracy of the Argives was less suited to them, with their oligarchical form of government, than the constitution of the Lacedaemonians.


5.32.1
3601
περὶ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τοῦ θέρους τούτου Σκιωναίους μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐκπολιορκήσαντες ἀπέκτειναν τοὺς ἡβῶντας , παῖδας δὲ καὶ γυναῖκας ἠνδραπόδισαν , καὶ τὴν γῆν Πλαταιεῦσιν ἔδοσαν νέμεσθαι , Δηλίους δὲ κατήγαγον πάλιν ἐς Δῆλον , ἐνθυμούμενοι τάς τε ἐν ταῖς μάχαις ξυμφορὰς καὶ τοῦ ἐν Δελφοῖς θεοῦ χρήσαντος .
About the same period of this summer, the Athenians, having reduced the Scionaeans to surrender, put the adult males to death; while they sold into slavery the women and children, and gave the territory for the Plataeans to occupy. On the other hand, they brought back the Delians to their country, from scruples arising from their disasters in different battles, and because the god at Delphi had so commanded them.


5.32.2
3602
καὶ Φωκῆς καὶ Λοκροὶ ἤρξαντο πολεμεῖν .
At this time, too, the Phocians and. Locrians commenced hostilities.


5.32.3
3603
καὶ Κορίνθιοι καὶ Ἀργεῖοι ἤδη ξύμμαχοι ὄντες ἔρχονται ἐς Τεγέαν ἀποστήσοντες Λακεδαιμονίων , ὁρῶντες μέγα μέρος ὂν καί , εἰ σφίσι προσγένοιτο , νομίζοντες ἅπασαν ἂν ἔχειν Πελοπόννησον .
And the Corinthians and Argives, being now in alliance, went to Tegea, to procure its revolt from the Lacedaemonians, seeing that it formed a considerable part of the Peloponnese, and thinking that, if it were added to them, they would command the whole of it.


5.32.4
3604
ὡς δὲ οὐδὲν ἂν ἔφασαν ἐναντιωθῆναι οἱ Τεγεᾶται Λακεδαιμονίοις , οἱ Κορίνθιοι μέχρι τούτου προθύμως πράσσοντες ἀνεῖσαν τῆς φιλονικίας καὶ ὠρρώδησαν μὴ οὐδεὶς σφίσιν ἔτι τῶν ἄλλων προσχωρῇ .
But when the Tegeans said they would do nothing in opposition to the Lacedaemonians, the Corinthians, though hitherto very hearty in their measures, relaxed in their vehemence, and were afraid that none of the other parties might now come over to them. They went, however, to the Boeotians, and begged them to enter into alliance with themselves and the Argives, and act in all other respects in concert with them.


5.32.5
3605
ὅμως δὲ ἐλθόντες ἐς τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς ἐδέοντο σφῶν τε καὶ Ἀργείων γίγνεσθαι ξυμμάχους καὶ τ- ἄλλα κοινῇ πράσσειν ·
With reference to the ten days' truces also, which had been made with each other by the Athenians and Boeotians not long after the conclusion of the fifty years' treaty,


5.32.5
3606
τάς τε δεχημέρους ἐπισπονδάς , αἳ ἦσαν Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Βοιωτοῖς πρὸς ἀλλήλους οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον γενόμεναι τούτων τῶν πεντηκοντουτίδων σπονδῶν , ἐκέλευον οἱ Κορίνθιοι τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς ἀκολουθήσαντας Ἀθήναζε καὶ σφίσι ποιῆσαι , ὥσπερ Βοιωτοὶ εἶχον , μὴ δεχομένων δὲ Ἀθηναίων ἀπειπεῖν τὴν ἐκεχειρίαν καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν μὴ σπένδεσθαι ἄνευ αὐτῶν .
the Corinthians desired the Boeotians to accompany them to Athens, and obtain the same for them also, on the same footing as the Boeotians; and in case of the Athenians not acceding to this, then to renounce the suspension of arms, and in future to make no truce without being joined by them.


5.32.6
3607
Βοιωτοὶ δὲ δεομένων τῶν Κορινθίων περὶ μὲν τῆς Ἀργείων ξυμμαχίας ἐπισχεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐκέλευον , ἐλθόντες δὲ Ἀθήναζε μετὰ Κορινθίων οὐχ ηὕροντο τὰς δεχημέρους σπονδάς , ἀλλ’ ἀπεκρίναντο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι Κορινθίοις εἶναι σπονδάς , εἴπερ Λακεδαιμονίων εἰσὶ ξύμμαχοι .
they went with them, however, to Athens, but did not obtain the ten days' truce; as the Athenians answered, that they were already in treaty with the Corinthians, inasmuch as they were allies of the Lacedaemonians.


5.32.7
3608
Βοιωτοὶ μὲν οὖν οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἀπεῖπον τὰς δεχημέρους , ἀξιούντων καὶ αἰτιωμένων Κορινθίων ξυνθέσθαι σφίσιν ·
The Boeotians, then, did not any the more on that account renounce their ten days' truce,


5.32.7
3609
Κορινθίοις δὲ ἀνοκωχὴ ἄσπονδος ἦν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους .
though the Corinthians called on them to do so, and expostulated with them on the ground of their having agreed to do it. Between the Corinthians, however, and the Athenians there was a suspension of arms without any actual truce.


5.33.1
3610
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους πανδημεὶ ἐστράτευσαν , Πλειστοάνακτος τοῦ Παυσανίου Λακεδαιμονίων Βασιλέως ἡγουμένου , τῆς Ἀρκαδίας ἐς Παρρασίους , Μαντινέων ὑπηκόους ὄντας , κατὰ στάσιν ἐπικαλεσαμένων σφᾶς , ἅμα δὲ καὶ τὸ ἐν Κυψέλοις τεῖχος ἀναιρήσοντες , ἢν δύνωνται , ὃ ἐτείχισαν Μαντινῆς καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐφρούρουν , ἐν τῇ Παρρασικῇ κείμενον ἐπὶ τῇ Σκιρίτιδι τῆς Λακωνικῆς .
The same summer, the Lacedaemonians made an expedition with all their forces, under the command of Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, their king, into the country of the Parrhasians in Arcadia, who were subject to the Mantineans, and who had invited their interference in the spirit of faction: intending also, if they could, to demolish the stronghold at Cypsela, which, being situated in the Parrhasian territory, the Mantineans had fortified and garrisoned with their own troops, for the annoyance of the district of Sciritis in Laconia The Lacedaemonians therefore proceeded to ravage the land of the Parrhasians;


5.33.2
3611
καὶ οἱ μὲν Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὴν γῆν τῶν Παρρασίων ἐδῄουν , οἱ δὲ Μαντινῆς τὴν πόλιν Ἀργείοις φύλαξι παραδόντες αὐτοὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίδα ἐφρούρουν ·
while the Mantineans, having committed their city to the custody of Argive troops, themselves kept guard over their confederates' country.


5.33.2
3612
ἀδύνατοι δ’ ὄντες διασῶσαι τό τε ἐν Κυψέλοις τεῖχος καὶ τὰς ἐν Παρρασίοις πόλεις ἀπῆλθον .
Being unable, however, to save the fort at Cypsela, and the towns in Parrhasia, they retired.


5.33.3
3613
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ τούς τε Παρρασίους αὐτονόμους ποιήσαντες καὶ τὸ τεῖχος καθελόντες ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The Lacedaemonians, after making the Parrhasians independent, and demolishing the fortress, returned home.


5.34.1
3614
καὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους ἤδη ἡκόντων αὐτοῖς τῶν ἀπὸ Θρᾴκης μετὰ Βρασίδου ἐξελθόντων στρατιωτῶν , οὓς ὁ Κλεαρίδας μετὰ τὰς σπονδὰς ἐκόμισεν , οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐψηφίσαντο τοὺς μὲν μετὰ Βρασίδου Εἵλωτας μαχεσαμένους ἐλευθέρους εἶναι καὶ οἰκεῖν ὅπου ἂν βούλωνται , καὶ ὕστερον οὐ πολλῷ αὐτοὺς μετὰ τῶν νεοδαμωδῶν ἐς Λέπρεον κατέστησαν , κείμενον ἐπὶ τῆς Λακωνικῆς καὶ τῆς Ἠλείας , ὄντες ἤδη διάφοροι Ἠλείοις ·
Moreover, in the course of the same summer, on the arrival of the troops from Thrace who had marched out with Brasidas, and whom Clearidas had brought back after the treaty was made, the Lacedaemonians decreed that the helots who had fought under Brasidas should be free, and live where they pleased; and not long after they settled them, together with the Neodamodes, at Lepreum, which is situated on the borders of Laconia and Elis; for they were now at variance with the Eleans.


5.34.2
3615
τοὺς δ’ ἐκ τῆς νήσου ληφθέντας σφῶν καὶ τὰ ὅπλα παραδόντας , δείσαντες μή τι διὰ τὴν ξυμφορὰν νομίσαντες ἐλασσωθήσεσθαι καὶ ὄντες ἐπίτιμοι νεωτερίσωσιν , ἤδη καὶ ἀρχάς τινας ἔχοντας ἀτίμους ἐποίησαν , ἀτιμίαν δὲ τοιάνδε ὥστε μήτε ἄρχειν μήτε πριαμένους τι ἢ πωλοῦντας κυρίους εἶναι .
But with regard to those of their own body who had been taken in the island, and had surrendered their arms, fearing they might suppose that they would be subjected to some degradation in consequence of their misfortune, and so, if allowed to retain their franchise, might attempt a revolution,


5.34.2
3616
ὕστερον δὲ αὖθις χρόνῳ ἐπίτιμοι ἐγένοντο .
they disfranchised them, even while some were holding offices; and with a disfranchisement of such a kind that they could neither take office, nor have power to buy or sell any thing. Subsequently, however, in the course of time, they were again enfranchised.


5.35.1
3617
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους καὶ Θυσσὸν τὴν ἐν τῇ Ἄθω Ἀκτῇ Διῆς εἷλον , Ἀθηναίων οὖσαν ξύμμαχον .
The same summer also the Dians took Thyssus on the promontory of Athos, a colony of the Athenians.


5.35.2
3618
καὶ τὸ θέρος τοῦτο πᾶν ἐπιμειξίαι μὲν ἦσαν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Πελοποννησίοις , ὑπώπτευον δὲ ἀλλήλους εὐθὺς μετὰ τὰς σπονδὰς οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι κατὰ τὴν τῶν χωρίων ἀλλήλοις οὐκ ἀπόδοσιν .
And during the whole of this summer there was intercourse indeed between the Athenians and Peloponnesians, but both parties suspected each other, from immediately after the conclusion of the treaty, on the ground of their not mutually restoring the places specified. For the Lacedaemonians, to whose lot it fell first to restore Amphipolis and the other towns, had not done so:


5.35.3
3619
τὴν γὰρ Ἀμφίπολιν πρότεροι λαχόντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀποδιδόναι καὶ τ- ἄλλα οὐκ ἀπεδεδώκεσαν , οὐδὲ τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης παρεῖχον ξυμμάχους τὰς σπονδὰς δεχομένους οὐδὲ Βοιωτοὺς οὐδὲ Κορινθίους , λέγοντες αἰεὶ ὡς μετ’ Ἀθηναίων τούτους , ἢν μὴ ’θέλωσι , κοινῇ ἀναγκάσουσιν ·
nor did they make their Thrace-ward allies accede to the treaty, nor the Boeotians, nor the Corinthians; though they were continually saying that, in conjunction with the Athenians, they would compel those states to do so, if they would not of their own accord.


5.35.3
3620
χρόνους τε προύθεντο ἄνευ ξυγγραφῆς ἐν οἷς χρῆν τοὺς μὴ ἐσιόντας ἀμφοτέροις πολεμίους εἶναι .
They also pleaded in excuse the fact of the time not being specified, at which those who did not accede to it were to be considered as enemies to both sides.


5.35.4
3621
τούτων οὖν ὁρῶντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐδὲν ἔργῳ γιγνόμενον ὑπώπτευον τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους μηδὲν δίκαιον διανοεῖσθαι , ὥστε οὔτε Πύλον ἀπαιτούντων αὐτῶν ἀπεδίδοσαν , ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς νήσου δεσμώτας μετεμέλοντο ἀποδεδωκότες , τά τε ἄλλα χωρία εἶχον , μένοντες ἕως σφίσι κ- ἐκεῖνοι ποιήσειαν τὰ εἰρημένα .
The Athenians therefore, seeing none of these things really performed, suspected that the Lacedaemonians had no upright intentions; so that on their demanding back Pylus, they refused to restore it, (nay, they even repented of having given them back their prisoners taken in the island,) and kept the other places, waiting till they, on their part, performed for them what had been arranged.


5.35.5
3622
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ τὰ μὲν δυνατὰ ἔφασαν πεποιηκέναι ·
The Lacedaemonians said that they had done what was possible; for that they had restored the Athenian prisoners who were in their hands, and had recalled the troops in Thrace; and whatever else they had in their power.


5.35.5
3623
τοὺς γὰρ παρὰ σφίσι δεσμώτας ὄντας Ἀθηναίων ἀποδοῦναι καὶ τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης στρατιώτας ἀπαγαγεῖν καὶ εἴ του ἄλλου ἐγκρατεῖς ἦσαν ·
With regard to Amphipolis, they were not, they said, masters of it, so as to give it up; but they would endeavour to bring the Boeotians and Corinthians over to the treaty, and to recover Panactum;


5.35.5
3624
Ἀμφιπόλεως δὲ οὐκ ἔφασαν κρατεῖν ὥστε παραδοῦναι , Βοιωτοὺς δὲ πειράσεσθαι καὶ Κορινθίους ἐς τὰς σπονδὰς ἐσαγαγεῖν καὶ Πάνακτον ἀπολαβεῖν καὶ Ἀθηναίων ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐν Βοιωτοῖς αἰχμάλωτοι κομιεῖν .
and would restore as many of the Athenians as were prisoners in Boeotia.


5.35.6
3625
πύλον μέντοι ἠξίουν σφίσιν ἀποδοῦναι ·
They required, however, that they should restore Pylus to them;


5.35.6
3626
εἰ δὲ μή , Μεσσηνίους γε καὶ τοὺς Εἵλωτας ἐξαγαγεῖν , ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτοὶ τοὺς ἀπὸ Θρᾴκης , Ἀθηναίους δὲ φρουρεῖν τὸ χωρίον αὐτούς , εἰ βούλονται .
or if not that, should withdraw the Messenians and helots, as they, on their part, had withdrawn their troops from Thrace; and that the Athenians themselves should garrison it, if they would.


5.35.7
3627
πολλάκις δὲ καὶ πολλῶν λόγων γενομένων ἐν τῷ θέρει τούτῳ ἔπεισαν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ὥστε ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐκ Πύλου Μεσσηνίους καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους Εἵλωτάς τε καὶ ὅσοι ηὐτομολήκεσαν ἐκ τῆς Λακωνικῆς ·
So when conferences had been held, many and often, during this summer, they prevailed on the Athenians to withdraw from Pylus the Messenians, and the rest of the helots, and all who had deserted from Laconia;


5.35.7
3628
καὶ κατῴκισαν αὐτοὺς ἐν Κρανίοις τῆς Κεφαλληνίας .
and they settled them at Cranii in Cephallenia.


5.35.8
3629
τὸ μὲν οὖν θέρος τοῦτο ἡσυχία ἦν καὶ ἔφοδοι παρ’ ἀλλήλους .
During this summer, then, there was peace and free intercourse with each other.


5.36.1
3630
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος ( ἔτυχον γὰρ ἔφοροι ἕτεροι καὶ οὐκ ἐφ’ ὧν αἱ σπονδαὶ ἐγένοντο ἄρχοντες ἤδη , καί τινες αὐτῶν καὶ ἐναντίοι ταῖς σπονδαῖς ) ἐλθουσῶν πρεσβειῶν ἀπὸ τῆς ξυμμαχίδος καὶ παρόντων Ἀθηναίων καὶ Βοιωτῶν καὶ Κορινθίων καὶ πολλὰ ἐν ἀλλήλοις εἰπόντων καὶ οὐδὲν ξυμβάντων , ὡς ἀπῇσαν ἐπ’ οἴκου , τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς καὶ Κορινθίοις Κλεόβουλος καὶ Ξενάρης , οὗτοι οἵπερ τῶν ἐφόρων ἐβούλοντο μάλιστα διαλῦσαι τὰς σπονδάς , λόγους ποιοῦνται ἰδίους , παραινοῦντες ὅτι μάλιστα ταῦτά τε γιγνώσκειν καὶ πειρᾶσθαι Βοιωτούς , Ἀργείων γενομένους πρῶτον αὐτοὺς ξυμμάχους , αὖθις μετὰ Βοιωτῶν Ἀργείους Λακεδαιμονίοις ποιῆσαι ξυμμάχους ( οὕτω γὰρ ἥκιστ’ ἂν ἀναγασθῆναι Βοιωτοὺς ἐς τὰς Ἀττικὰς σπονδὰς ἐσελθεῖν ·
But the following winter, (different ephors happening now to be in office, and not those under whom the treaty had been made, and some of them being even opposed to it,) when embassies had come from their confederacy, and the Athenians, Boeotians, and Corinthians were there, and they had held many discussions with one another, and come to no agreement; on their departing homeward, Cleobulus and Xenares—those of the ephors who most wished to break up the treaty—held a private conference with the Boeotians and Corinthians, advising them to pursue as far as possible the same policy;


5.36.1
3631
ἑλέσθαι γὰρ Λακεδαιμονίους πρὸ τῆς Ἀθηναίων ἔχθρας καὶ διαλύσεως τῶν σπονδῶν Ἀργείους σφίσι φίλους καὶ ξυμμάχους γενέσθαι ·
and that the Boeotians, after first entering into alliance with Argos themselves, should then endeavour to bring the Argives together with themselves into alliance with the Lacedaemonians.


5.36.1
3632
τὸ γὰρ Ἄργος αἰεὶ ἠπίσταντο ἐπιθυμοῦντας τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους καλῶς σφίσι φίλιον γενέσθαι ) , ἡγούμενοι τὸν ἔξω Πελοποννήσου πόλεμον ῥᾴω ἂν εἶναι .
For in this way the Boeotians were least likely to be forced to accede to the Attic treaty; since the Lacedaemonians would prefer gaining the friendship and alliance of the Argives even at the risk of the enmity of the Athenians and the dissolution of the treaty. For they knew that the Lacedaemonians were always desirous that Argos should be their friend on fair terms; thinking that so the war out of the Peloponnese would be more easily conducted by them.


5.36.2
3633
τὸ μέντοι Πάνακτον ἐδέοντο Βοιωτοὺς ὅπως παραδώσουσι Λακεδαιμονίοις , ἵνα ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ Πύλον , ἢν δύνωνται , ἀπολαβόντες ῥᾷον καθιστῶνται Ἀθηναίοις ἐς πόλεμον .
They begged the Boeotians, however, to put Panactum into the hands of the Lacedaemonians; that by getting back Pylus, if they could, in exchange for it, they might more easily proceed to hostilities with the Athenians.


5.37.1
3634
καὶ οἱ μὲν Βοιωτοὶ καὶ Κορίνθιοι ταῦτα ἐπεσταλμένοι ἀπό τε τοῦ Ξενάρους καὶ Κλεοβούλου καὶ ὅσοι φίλοι ἦσαν αὐτοῖς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ὥστε ἀπαγγεῖλαι ἐπὶ τὰ κοινά , ἑκάτεροι ἀνεχώρουν .
The Boeotians and Corinthians, having received from Xenares and Cleobulus, and such of the Lacedaemonians as were friendly towards them, these instructions to carry to their governments, went each their way.


5.37.2
3635
Ἀργείων δὲ δύο ἄνδρες τῆς ἀρχῆς τῆς μεγίστης ἐπετήρουν ἀπιόντας αὐτοὺς καθ’ ὁδὸν καὶ ξυγγενόμενοι ἐς λόγους ἦλθον , εἴ πως οἱ Βοιωτοὶ σφίσι ξύμμαχοι γένοιντο ὥσπερ Κορίνθιοι καὶ Ἠλεῖοι καὶ Μαντινῆς ·
But two persons of the Argives, who held the highest office in their country, watched for them by the way, as they were returning; and having met them, entered into conversation with them on the possibility of the Boeotians becoming their allies, as the Corinthians, Eleans, and Mantineans had done;


5.37.2
3636
νομίζειν γὰρ ἂν τούτου προχωρήσαντος ῥᾳδίως ἤδη καὶ πολεμεῖν καὶ σπένδεσθαι καὶ πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους , εἰ βούλοιντο , κοινῷ λόγῳ χρωμένους , καὶ εἴ τινα πρὸς ἄλλον δέοι .
for if that could be well arranged, they thought they might then, on advantageous terms, both carry on war and make peace, both with the Lacedaemonians, if they should wish it—holding the same language all together—and with whomever else it might be necessary.


5.37.3
3637
τοῖς δὲ τῶν Βοιωτῶν πρέσβεσιν ἀκούουσιν ἤρεσκεν ·
The Boeotian envoys were pleased at hearing this;


5.37.3
3638
κατὰ τύχην γὰρ ἐδέοντο τούτων ὧνπερ καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος αὐτοῖς φίλοι ἐπεστάλκεσαν .
for they happened to ask the same things as their friends in Lacedaemon had instructed them to propose.


5.37.3
3639
καὶ οἱ τῶν Ἀργείων ἄνδρες ὡς ᾔσθοντο αὐτοὺς δεχομένους τὸν λόγον , εἰπόντες ὅτι πρέσβεις πέμψουσιν ἐς Βοιωτοὺς ἀπῆλθον .
So when the men from Argos perceived that they listened to their suggestions, they said they would send ambassadors to the Boeotians, and went away.


5.37.4
3640
ἀφικόμενοι δὲ οἱ Βοιωτοὶ ἀπήγγειλαν τοῖς βοιωτάρχαις τά τε ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος καὶ τὰ ἀπὸ τῶν ξυγγενομένων Ἀργείων ·
The Boeotians, on their arrival, reported to the Boeotarchs what had been said to them, both at Lacedaemon, and by the Argives who had met them:


5.37.4
3641
καὶ οἱ βοιωτάρχαι ἠρέσκοντό τε καὶ πολλῷ προθυμότεροι ἦσαν , ὅτι ἀμφοτέρωθεν ξυνεβεβήκει αὐτοῖς τούς τε φίλους τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τῶν αὐτῶν δεῖσθαι καὶ τοὺς Ἀργείους ἐς τὰ ὁμοῖα σπεύδειν .
and the Boeotarchs were pleased, and were much more eager in the business, since it had turned out so luckily for them in both quarters, that their friends amongst the Lacedaemonians requested the same things as the Argives were anxiously wishing.


5.37.5
3642
καὶ οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον πρέσβεις παρῆσαν Ἀργείων τὰ εἰρημένα προκαλούμενοι ·
Not long after, ambassadors came from Argos with the proposals that have been mentioned;


5.37.5
3643
καὶ αὐτοὺς ἀπέπεμψαν ἐπαινέσαντες τοὺς λόγους οἱ βοιωτάρχαι καὶ πρέσβεις ὑποσχόμενοι ἀποστελεῖν περὶ τῆς ξυμμαχίας ἐς Ἄργος .
whom the Boeotarchs sent back after assenting to their terms, and promising to send envoys to Argos on the question of the alliance.


5.38.1
3644
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ ἐδόκει πρῶτον τοῖς βοιωτάρχαις καὶ Κορινθίοις καὶ Μεγαρεῦσι καὶ τοῖς ἀπὸ Θρᾴκης πρέσβεσιν ὀμόσαι ὅρκους ἀλλήλοις ἦ μὴν ἔν τε τῷ παρατυχόντι ἀμυνεῖν τῷ δεομένῳ καὶ μὴ πολεμήσειν τῳ μηδὲ ξυμβήσεσθαι ἄνευ κοινῆς γνώμης , καὶ οὕτως ἤδη τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς καὶ Μεγαρέας ( τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ ἐποίουν ) πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους σπένδεσθαι .
In the mean time it was determined by the Boeotarchs, the Corinthians, the Megareans, and the ambassadors from Thrace, in the first place, to bind themselves by oaths to each other, that assuredly, when occasion offered, they would assist the party which needed it; and that they would carry on war with none, or make peace, without common assent; and that so the Boeotians and Megareans (for they had the same object before them) should then enter into treaty with the Argives.


5.38.2
3645
πρὶν δὲ τοὺς ὅρκους γενέσθαι οἱ βοιωτάρχαι ἐκοίνωσαν ταῖς τέσσαρσι βουλαῖς τῶν Βοιωτῶν ταῦτα , αἵπερ ἅπαν τὸ κῦρος ἔχουσιν , καὶ παρῄνουν γενέσθαι ὅρκους ταῖς πόλεσιν , ὅσαι βούλονται ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ σφίσι ξυνομνύναι .
But before the oaths were taken, the Boeotarchs communicated these resolutions to the four councils of the Boeotians, which have the sole power of ratifying measures; and recommended to them that oaths should be exchanged with such cities as wished to league with them for mutual assistance.


5.38.3
3646
οἱ δ’ ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς τῶν Βοιωτῶν ὄντες οὐ προσδέχονται τὸν λόγον , δεδιότες μὴ ἐναντία Λακεδαιμονίοις ποιήσωσι , τοῖς ἐκείνων ἀφεστῶσι Κορινθίοις ξυνομνύντες ·
However, the members of the Boeotian councils did not accede to the plan, fearing that they should do what was displeasing to the Lacedaemonians, if they leagued with the Corinthians, who had separated from them.


5.38.3
3647
οὐ γὰρ εἶπον αὐτοῖς οἱ βοιωτάρχαι τὰ ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος , ὅτι τῶν τε ἐφόρων Κλεόβουλος καὶ Ξενάρης καὶ οἱ φίλοι παραινοῦσιν Ἀργείων πρῶτον καὶ Κορινθίων γενομένους ξυμμάχους ὕστερον μετὰ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων γίγνεσθαι , οἰόμενοι τὴν βουλήν , κἂν μὴ εἴπωσιν , οὐκ ἄλλα ψηφιεῖσθαι ἢ ἃ σφίσι προδιαγνόντες παραινοῦσιν .
For the Boeotarchs did not tell them of what had taken place at Lacedaemon, namely, that Cleobulus and Xenares, amongst the ephors, and their friends, advised them first to enter into alliance with the Argives and Corinthians, and then to join the Lacedaemonians; as they imagined, that though they should not mention it, the council would decree nothing different from what they had previously determined on, and now recommended to their country.


5.38.4
3648
ὡς δὲ ἀντέστη τὸ πρᾶγμα , οἱ μὲν Κορίνθιοι καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ Θρᾴκης πρέσβεις ἄπρακτοι ἀπῆλθον , οἱ δὲ βοιωτάρχαι μέλλοντες πρότερον , εἰ ταῦτα ἔπεισαν , καὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν πειράσεσθαι πρὸς Ἀργείους ποιεῖν , οὐκέτι ἐσήνεγκαν περὶ Ἀργείων ἐς τὰς βουλάς , οὐδὲ ἐς τὸ Ἄργος τοὺς πρέσβεις οὓς ὑπέσχοντο ἔπεμπον , ἀμέλεια δέ τις ἐνῆν καὶ διατριβὴ τῶν πάντων .
When the business had met with this check, the ambassadors from Corinth and Thrace departed without concluding any thing; while the Boeotarchs, who before intended, if they carried these measures, to attempt also to effect the alliance with the Argives, did not now bring the question of the Argives before the councils, or send to Argos the ambassadors they had promised; but there arose an indifference and procrastination in the whole business.


5.39.1
3649
καὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ Μηκύβερναν Ὀλύνθιοι , Ἀθηναίων φρουρούντων , ἐπιδραμόντες εἷλον .
In the course of this same summer, the Olynthians assaulted and took Mecyberna, which was garrisoned by Athenians.


5.39.2
3650
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ( ἐγίγνοντο γὰρ αἰεὶ λόγοι τοῖς τε Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις περὶ ὧν εἶχον ἀλλήλων ) ἐλπίζοντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , εἰ Πάνακτον Ἀθηναῖοι παρὰ Βοιωτῶν ἀπολάβοιεν , κομίσασθαι ἂν αὐτοὶ Πύλον , ἦλθον ἐς τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς πρεσβευόμενοι καὶ ἐδέοντο σφίσι Πάνακτόν τε καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίων δεσμώτας παραδοῦναι , ἵνα ἀντ’ αὐτῶν Πύλον κομίσωνται .
After these events, conferences being continually held between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians respecting the possessions of each other which they still retained, the Lacedaemonians, hoping that, if the Athenians should receive back Panactum from the Boeotians, they would themselves recover Pylus, went on an embassy to the Boeotians, and begged them to deliver up to them Panactum and the Athenian prisoners, that they might recover Pylus in exchange for them.


5.39.3
3651
οἱ δὲ Βοιωτοὶ οὐκ ἔφασαν ἀποδώσειν , ἢν μὴ σφίσι ξυμμαχίαν ἰδίαν ποιήσωνται ὥσπερ Ἀθηναίοις .
But the Boeotians refused to deliver them up, unless they would make an especial alliance with them, as with the Athenians.


5.39.3
3652
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ εἰδότες μὲν ὅτι ἀδικήσουσιν Ἀθηναίους , εἰρημένον ἄνευ ἀλλήλων μήτε σπένδεσθαί τῳ μήτε πολεμεῖν , βουλόμενοι δὲ τὸ Πάνακτον παραλαβεῖν ὡς τὴν Πύλον ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ κομιούμενοι , καὶ ἅμα τῶν ξυγχέαι σπευδόντων τὰς σπονδὰς προθυμουμένων τὰ ἐς Βοιωτούς , ἐποιήσαντο τὴν ξυμμαχίαν τοῦ χειμῶνος τελευτῶντος ἤδη καὶ πρὸς ἔαρ ·
Although therefore the Lacedaemonians were aware that they should be acting wrong to the Athenians, since it had been stipulated that they should make neither peace nor war with any but by mutual consent; yet, as they wished to receive Panactum from them, believing that so they should recover Pylus, and as the party which was anxious to break up the treaty earnestly entered into the Boeotian negotiation; they concluded the alliance, when the winter was now closing and the spring at hand;


5.39.3
3653
καὶ τὸ Πάνακτον εὐθὺς καθῃρεῖτο .
and Panactum was immediately begun to be demolished.


5.39.3
3654
καὶ ἑνδέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα .
And thus ended the eleventh year of this war.


5.40.1
3655
ἅμα δὲ τῷ ἦρι εὐθὺς τοῦ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους οἱ Ἀργεῖοι , ὡς οἵ τε πρέσβεις τῶν Βοιωτῶν οὓς ἔφασαν πέμψειν οὐχ ἧκον τό τε Πάνακτον ᾔσθοντο καθαιρούμενον καὶ ξυμμαχίαν ἰδίαν γεγενημένην τοῖς Βοιωτοῖς πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , ἔδεισαν μὴ μονωθῶσι καὶ ἐς Λακεδαιμονίους πᾶσα ἡ ξυμμαχία χωρήσῃ ·
As soon as the spring of the next summer commenced, the Argives, finding that the Boeotian ambassadors, whom they said they would send, did not come, and that Panactum was being demolished, and an especial alliance had been concluded by the Boeotians with the Lacedaemonians, were afraid that they might be left alone, and all the confederacy go over to the Lacedaemonians.


5.40.2
3656
τοὺς γὰρ Βοιωτοὺς ᾤοντο πεπεῖσθαι ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων τό τε Πάνακτον καθελεῖν καὶ ἐς τὰς Ἀθηναίων σπονδὰς ἐσιέναι , τούς τε Ἀθηναίους εἰδέναι ταῦτα , ὥστε οὐδὲ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ἔτι σφίσιν εἶναι ξυμμαχίαν ποιήσασθαι , πρότερον ἐλπίζοντες ἐκ τῶν διαφορῶν , εἰ μὴ μείνειαν αὐτοῖς αἱ πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους σπονδαί , τοῖς γοῦν Ἀθηναίοις ξύμμαχοι ἔσεσθαι .
For they supposed that the Boeotians had been persuaded by the Lacedaemonians both to demolish Panactum and to accede to the treaty with the Athenians; and that the Athenians were privy to these measures; so that they themselves had no longer power even to make alliance with the Athenians: whereas they hoped before, in consequence of the existing dissensions, that if their treaty with the Lacedaemonians should not continue, they would, at any rate, be in alliance with the Athenians.


5.40.3
3657
ἀποροῦντες οὖν ταῦτα οἱ Ἀργεῖοι , καὶ φοβούμενοι μὴ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Τεγεάταις , Βοιωτοῖς καὶ Ἀθηναίοις ἅμα πολεμῶσι , πρότερον οὐ δεχόμενοι τὰς Λακεδαιμονίων σπονδάς , ἀλλ’ ἐν φρονήματι ὄντες τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἡγήσεσθαι , ἔπεμπον ὡς ἐδύναντο τάχιστα ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πρέσβεις Εὔστροφον καὶ Αἴσωνα , οἳ ἐδόκουν προσφιλέστατοι αὐτοῖς εἶναι , ἡγούμενοι ἐκ τῶν παρόντων κράτιστα πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους σπονδὰς ποιησάμενοι , ὅπῃ ἂν ξυγχωρῇ , ἡσυχίαν ἔχειν .
The Argives, then, were involved in these difficulties, and feared they might be engaged in war at once with the Lacedaemonians, Tegeans, Boeotians, and Athenians: and consequently, though they did not before accept the treaty with the Lacedaemonians, but entertained the proud hope that they should enjoy the supremacy over the Peloponnese; they sent as envoys to Lacedaemon, as quickly as they could, Eustrophus and Aeson, who were considered to be the most acceptable persons to them; thinking to live in quiet by making a treaty with the Lacedaemonians, as they best could under present circumstances, whatever might be the arrangement.


5.41.1
3658
καὶ οἱ πρέσβεις ἀφικόμενοι αὐτῶν λόγους ἐποιοῦντο πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἐφ’ ᾧ ἂν σφίσιν αἱ σπονδαὶ γίγνοιντο .
On the arrival of their ambassadors, they made proposals to the Lacedaemonians, as to the terms on which the treaty should be concluded between them.


5.41.2
3659
καὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ἠξίουν δίκης ἐπιτροπὴν σφίσι γενέσθαι ἢ ἐς πόλιν τινὰ ἢ ἰδιώτην περὶ τῆς Κυνουρίας γῆς , ἧς αἰεὶ πέρι διαφέρονται μεθορίας οὔσης ( ἔχει δὲ ἐν αὑτῇ Θυρέαν καὶ Ἀνθήνην πόλιν , νέμονται δ’ αὐτὴν Λακεδαιμόνιοι ) ·
And at first the Argives claimed that they should have a judicial reference granted them, either to some state or individual, respecting the Cynurian territory; concerning which they have always been debating, as it is border-land: (it contains the towns of Thyrea and Anthene, and is occupied by the Lacedaemonians.)


5.41.2
3660
ἔπειτα δ’ οὐκ ἐώντων Λακεδαιμονίων μεμνῆσθαι περὶ αὐτῆς , ἀλλ’ , εἰ βούλονται σπένδεσθαι ὥσπερ πρότερον , ἑτοῖμοι εἶναι , οἱ Ἀργεῖοι πρέσβεις τάδε ὅμως ἐπηγάγοντο τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ξυγχωρῆσαι , ἐν μὲν τῷ παρόντι σπονδὰς ποιήσασθαι ἔτη πεντήκοντα , ἐξεῖναι δ’ ὁποτεροισοῦν προκαλεσαμένοις , μήτε νόσου οὔσης μήτε πολέμου Λακεδαίμονι καὶ Ἄργει , διαμάχεσθαι περὶ τῆς γῆς ταύτης , ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερόν ποτε ὅτε αὐτοὶ ἑκάτεροι ἠξίωσαν νικᾶν , διώκειν δὲ μὴ ἐξεῖναι περαιτέρω τῶν πρὸς Ἄργος καὶ Λακεδαίμονα ὅρων .
Afterwards, when the Lacedaemonians begged them not to mention that, but said that if they wished to make a treaty as before, they were ready to do so; the Argive ambassadors nevertheless induced the Lacedaemonians to agree to the following conditions: that at the present time they should make a treaty for fifty years; but that on either party giving a challenge, at a time when there was neither plague nor war in Lacedaemon or Argos, they should be at liberty to decide by battle the question of this territory—as on a former occasion, when each side claimed the victory for themselves—but not to pursue the fugitives beyond the frontiers, whether towards Argos or Lacedaemon.


5.41.3
3661
τοῖς δὲ Λακεδαιμονίοις τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἐδόκει μωρία εἶναι ταῦτα , ἔπειτα ( ἐπεθύμουν γὰρ τὸ Ἄργος πάντως φίλιον ἔχειν ) ξυνεχώρησαν ἐφ’ οἷς ἠξίουν καὶ ξυνεγράψαντο .
Now the Lacedaemonians at first considered this as mere folly;


5.41.3
3662
ἐκέλευον δ’ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , πρὶν τέλος τι αὐτῶν ἔχειν , ἐς τὸ Ἄργος πρῶτον ἐπαναχωρήσαντας αὐτοὺς δεῖξαι τῷ πλήθει , καὶ ἢν ἀρέσκοντα ᾖ , ἥκειν ἐς τὰ Ὑακίνθια τοὺς ὅρκους ποιησομένους .
but afterwards, (for they were anxious on any terms to have Argos for a friend,) they agreed to the conditions they demanded, and made a treaty with them in writing. Before, however, any thing was definitely arranged, the Lacedaemonians desired them to return first to Argos, and show it to their people; and if it pleased them, then to come at the Hyacinthia, to take the oaths.


5.41.3
3663
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀνεχώρησαν ·
Accordingly they returned.


5.42.1

ἐν δὲ τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ ᾧ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ταῦτα ἔπρασσον , οἱ πρέσβεις τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων Ἀνδρομένης καὶ Φαίδιμος καὶ Ἀντιμενίδας , οὓς ἔδει τὸ Πάνακτον καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς παρὰ Βοιωτῶν παραλαβόντας Ἀθηναίοις ἀποδοῦναι , τὸ μὲν Πάνακτον ὑπὸ τῶν Βοιωτῶν αὐτῶν καθῃρημένον ηὗρον , ἐπὶ προφάσει ὡς ἦσάν ποτε Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Βοιωτοῖς ἐκ διαφορᾶς περὶ αὐτοῦ ὅρκοι παλαιοὶ μηδετέρους οἰκεῖν τὸ χωρίον , ἀλλὰ κοινῇ νέμειν , τοὺς δ’ ἄνδρας οὓς εἶχον αἰχμαλώτους Βοιωτοὶ Ἀθηναίων παραλαβόντες οἱ περὶ τὸν Ἀνδρομένη ἐκόμισαν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ ἀπέδοσαν , τοῦ τε Πανάκτου τὴν καθαίρεσιν ἔλεγον αὐτοῖς , νομίζοντες καὶ τοῦτο ἀποδιδόναι ·
In the mean time, while the Argives were negotiating these matters, the Lacedaemonian ambassadors, Andromedes, Phaedimus, and Antimenidas, who were to restore Panactum to the Athenians, and to receive the prisoners from the Boeotians, and bring them back home, found Panactum demolished by the Boeotians themselves, on the pretext of there having been exchanged in former times between the Athenians and Boeotians, in consequence of a dispute about it, an oath that neither party should inhabit the place, but that they should graze it in common. The men, however, whom the Boeotians held as prisoners taken from the Athenians, Andromedes and his colleagues received from them, and conveyed to Athens, and restored. They likewise announced to them the demolition of Panactum, thinking that so they restored that too; for no enemy to the Athenians would in future inhabit it.


5.42.1
3665
πολέμιον γὰρ οὐκέτι ἐν αὐτῷ Ἀθηναίοις οἰκήσειν οὐδένα .
On this announcement, the Athenians expressed great indignation;


5.42.2
3666
λεγομένων δὲ τούτων οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι δεινὰ ἐποίουν , νομίζοντες ἀδικεῖσθαι ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων τοῦ τε Πανάκτου τῇ καθαιρέσει , ὃ ἔδει ὀρθὸν παραδοῦναι , καὶ πυνθανόμενοι ὅτι καὶ Βοιωτοῖς ἰδίᾳ ξυμμαχίαν πεποίηνται , φάσκοντες πρότερον κοινῇ τοὺς μὴ δεχομένους τὰς σπονδὰς προσαναγκάσειν .
thinking themselves wronged by the Lacedaemonians, both with regard to the demolition of Panactum, which they ought to have delivered up to them standing, and the intelligence of their having on their own account made treaty with the Boeotians, though they formerly declared that they would join in compelling those who did not accede to the general treaty.


5.42.2
3667
τά τε ἄλλα ἐσκόπουν ὅσα ἐξελελοίπεσαν τῆς ξυνθήκης καὶ ἐνόμιζον ἐξηπατῆσθαι , ὥστε χαλεπῶς πρὸς τοὺς πρέσβεις ἀποκρινάμενοι ἀπέπεμψαν .
They also looked for any other points in which they had departed from their compact, and considered themselves to have been overreached by them; so that they gave an angry reply to the ambassadors, and sent them away.


5.43.1
3668
κατὰ τοιαύτην δὴ διαφορὰν ὄντων τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , οἱ ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις αὖ βουλόμενοι λῦσαι τὰς σπονδὰς εὐθὺς ἐνέκειντο .
When the Lacedaemonians, then, were in such a state of variance with the Athenians, those at Athens, again, who wished to do away with the treaty, were immediately urgent against it.


5.43.2
3669
ἦσαν δὲ ἄλλοι τε καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδης ὁ Κλεινίου , ἀνὴρ ἡλικίᾳ μὲν ἔτι τότε ὢν νέος ὡς ἐν ἄλλῃ πόλει , ἀξιώματι δὲ προγόνων τιμώμενος ·
Amongst others who were so was Alcibiades son of Clinias, a man who in age was still at that time a youth, (as he would have been thought in any other state,) but honoured on account of the nobility of his ancestors.


5.43.2
3670
ᾧ ἐδόκει μὲν καὶ ἄμεινον εἶναι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους μᾶλλον χωρεῖν , οὐ μέντοι ἀλλὰ καὶ φρονήματι φιλονικῶν ἠναντιοῦτο , ὅτι Λακεδαιμόνιοι διὰ Νικίου καὶ Λάχητος ἔπραξαν τὰς σπονδάς , ἑαυτὸν κατά τε τὴν νεότητα ὑπεριδόντες καὶ κατὰ τὴν παλαιὰν προξενίαν ποτὲ οὖσαν οὐ τιμήσαντες , ἣν τοῦ πάππου ἀπειπόντος αὐτὸς τοὺς ἐκ τῆς νήσου αὐτῶν αἰχμαλώτους θεραπεύων διενοεῖτο ἀνανεώσασθαι .
He considered that it was really better to side with the Argives; though he also opposed the treaty in the bitterness of wounded pride, because the Lacedaemonians had negotiated it through the agency of Nicias and Laches, having overlooked him on account of his youth, and not having shown him the respect suitable to the old connexion of his family as their which, having been renounced by his grandfather, he himself thought to renew by showing attention to the prisoners taken in the island.


5.43.3
3671
πανταχόθεν τε νομίζων ἐλασσοῦσθαι τό τε πρῶτον ἀντεῖπεν , οὐ βεβαίους φάσκων εἶναι Λακεδαιμονίους , ἀλλ’ ἵνα Ἀργείους σφίσι σπεισάμενοι ἐξέλωσι καὶ αὖθις ἐπ’ Ἀθηναίους μόνους ἴωσι , τούτου ἕνεκα σπένδεσθαι αὐτούς , καὶ τότε , ἐπειδὴ ἡ διαφορὰ ἐγεγένητο , πέμπει εὐθὺς ἐς Ἄργος ἰδίᾳ , κελεύων ὡς τάχιστα ἐπὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν προκαλουμένους ἥκειν μετὰ Μαντινέων καὶ Ἠλείων , ὡς καιροῦ ὄντος καὶ αὐτὸς ξυμπράξων τὰ μάλιστα .
Considering himself therefore to be in every way slighted by them, he both spoke against the treaty in the first instance, saying that the Lacedaemonians were not to be depended upon, but were only making a treaty in order that by so doing they might deprive Athens of the Argives. and again come against them when left alone; and at that time, when this difference had arisen, he immediately sent to Argos on his own account, urging them to come as quickly as possible with proposals for alliance, in company with the Mantineans and Eleans, since it was a fine opportunity, and he would co-operate with them to the utmost.


5.44.1
3672
οἱ δὲ Ἀργεῖοι ἀκούσαντες τῆς τε ἀγγελίας καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἔγνωσαν οὐ μετ’ Ἀθηναίων πραχθεῖσαν τὴν τῶν Βοιωτῶν ξυμμαχίαν , ἀλλ’ ἐς διαφορὰν μεγάλην καθεστῶτας αὐτοὺς πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , τῶν μὲν ἐν Λακεδαίμονι πρέσβεων , οἳ σφίσι περὶ τῶν σπονδῶν ἔτυχον ἀπόντες , ἠμέλουν , πρὸς δὲ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μᾶλλον τὴν γνώμην εἶχον , νομίζοντες πόλιν τε σφίσι φιλίαν ἀπὸ παλαιοῦ καὶ δημοκρατουμένην ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ δύναμιν μεγάλην ἔχουσαν τὴν κατὰ θάλασσαν ξυμπολεμήσειν σφίσιν , ἢν καθιστῶνται ἐς πόλεμον .
When the Argives received this message, and found that the alliance with the Boeotians had not been brought about in concert with the Athenians, but that they were involved in a serious quarrel with the Lacedaemonians; they thought no more of their ambassadors at Lacedaemon, who were just at that time gone thither on the subject of the treaty, but paid more attention to the Athenians; thinking that so, if they went to war, there would be on their side in it a state which had been their friend from of old, and was under a democratical form of government, like themselves, and wielded a great power in the command of the sea.


5.44.2
3673
ἔπεμπον οὖν εὐθὺς πρέσβεις ὡς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους περὶ τῆς ξυμμαχίας ·
They immediately therefore sent ambassadors to the Athenians to treat of the alliance;


5.44.2
3674
ξυνεπρεσβεύοντο δὲ καὶ Ἠλεῖοι καὶ Μαντινῆς .
and were also accompanied by envoys from the Eleans and Mantineans.


5.44.3
3675
ἀφίκοντο δὲ καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων πρέσβεις κατὰ τάχος , δοκοῦντες ἐπιτήδειοι εἶναι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , Φιλοχαρίδας καὶ Λέων καὶ Ἔνδιος , δείσαντες μὴ τήν τε ξυμμαχίαν ὀργιζόμενοι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους ποιήσωνται , καὶ ἅμα Πύλον ἀπαιτήσοντες ἀντὶ Πανάκτου καὶ περὶ τῆς Βοιωτῶν ξυμμαχίας ἀπολογησόμενοι , ὡς οὐκ ἐπὶ κακῷ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐποιήσαντο .
There came likewise with all speed, as ambassadors from the Lacedaemonians, persons who were thought to be favourably inclined towards the Athenians, namely, Philocharidas, Leon, and Endius; through fear that in their anger they might conclude the alliance with the Argives, and at the same time to ask back Pylus in exchange for Panactum, and to plead in excuse for the Boeotian alliance, that it had not been made for the purpose of hurting the Athenians.


5.45.1
3676
καὶ λέγοντες ἐν τῇ βουλῇ περί τε τούτων καὶ ὡς αὐτοκράτορες ἥκουσι περὶ πάντων ξυμβῆναι τῶν διαφόρων , τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην ἐφόβουν μὴ καί , ἢν ἐς τὸν δῆμον ταῦτα λέγωσιν , ἐπαγάγωνται τὸ πλῆθος καὶ ἀπωσθῇ ἡ Ἀργείων ξυμμαχία .
By speaking in the council on these points, and declaring that they had come with full powers to effect a settlement of all their disputes, they made Alcibiades afraid that if they were to talk in the same strain to the popular assembly, they would win over the multitude, and the Argive alliance would be rejected. He adopted therefore the following device against them.


5.45.2
3677
μηχανᾶται δὲ πρὸς αὐτοὺς τοιόνδε τι ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης ·
He gained the confidence of the Lacedaemonians by giving them a solemn assurance,


5.45.2
3678
τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους πείθει πίστιν αὐτοῖς δούς , ἢν μὴ ὁμολογήσωσιν ἐν τῷ δήμῳ αὐτοκράτορες ἥκειν , Πύλον τε αὐτοῖς ἀποδώσειν ( πείσειν γὰρ αὐτὸς Ἀθηναίους , ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν ἀντιλέγειν ) καὶ τ- ἄλλα ξυναλλάξειν .
that if they would not acknowledge in the assembly that they had come with full powers, he would restore Pylus to them, (for he would himself persuade the Athenians to the measure, as he now opposed it,) and would settle all other points of difference.


5.45.3
3679
βουλόμενος δὲ αὐτοὺς Νικίου τε ἀποστῆσαι ταῦτα ἔπρασσε καὶ ὅπως ἐν τῷ δήμῳ διαβαλὼν αὐτοὺς ὡς οὐδὲν ἀληθὲς ἐν νῷ ἔχουσιν οὐδὲ λέγουσιν οὐδέποτε τ- αὐτά , τοὺς Ἀργείους καὶ Ἠλείους καὶ Μαντινέας ξυμμάχους ποιήσῃ .
It was with a wish to withdraw them from the influence of Nicias that he did this;


5.45.3
3680
καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως .
and in order that by accusing them before the people, as having no sincere intentions, and never saying the same thing, he might cause the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans, to be taken into alliance. And so it turned out.


5.45.4
3681
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἐς τὸν δῆμον παρελθόντες καὶ ἐπερωτώμενοι οὐκ ἔφασαν ὥσπερ ἐν τῇ βουλῇ αὐτοκράτορες ἥκειν , οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐκέτι ἠνείχοντο , ἀλλὰ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον καταβοῶντος τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἐσήκουόν τε καὶ ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν εὐθὺς παραγαγόντες τοὺς Ἀργείους καὶ τοὺς μετ’ αὐτῶν ξυμμάχους ποιεῖσθαι ·
For when, on coming before the people and being asked that question, they did not say, as they had said in the council, that they were come with full powers, the Athenians could endure it no longer;


5.45.4
3682
σεισμοῦ δὲ γενομένου πρίν τι ἐπικυρωθῆναι , ἡ ἐκκλησία αὕτη ἀνεβλήθη .
but on Alcibiades' exclaiming against the Lacedaemonians much more vehemently than before, they both listened to him, and were ready straightway to bring forward the Argives and those who were with them, and take them into alliance. An earthquake, however, having occurred before any thing was finally settled, that assembly was adjourned.


5.46.1
3683
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἐκκλησίᾳ ὁ Νικίας , καίπερ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων αὐτῶν ἠπατημένων καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξηπατημένος περὶ τοῦ μὴ αὐτοκράτορας ὁμολογῆσαι ἥκειν , ὅμως τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἔφη χρῆναι φίλους μᾶλλον γίγνεσθαι , καὶ ἐπισχόντας τὰ πρὸς Ἀργείους πέμψαι ἔτι ὡς αὐτοὺς καὶ εἰδέναι ὅτι διανοοῦνται , λέγων ἐν μὲν τῷ σφετέρῳ καλῷ , ἐν δὲ τῷ ἐκείνων ἀπρεπεῖ τὸν πόλεμον ἀναβάλλεσθαι ·
In the one which was held next day, although the Lacedaemonians had been outwitted, and he himself utterly deceived with regard to their confessing not to have come with full powers, Nicias nevertheless maintained that they ought rather to become friends of the Lacedaemonians, and, deferring their measures with the Argives, to send once more to them, and ascertain their intentions.


5.46.1
3684
σφίσι μὲν γὰρ εὖ ἑστώτων τῶν πραγμάτων ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἄριστον εἶναι διασώσασθαι τὴν εὐπραγίαν , ἐκείνοις δὲ δυστυχοῦσιν ὅτι τάχιστα εὕρημα εἶναι διακινδυνεῦσαι .
He represented that it was to their own honour, but to their rivals' discredit, for the war to be put off: for since their own affairs were in so good a condition, it was best to preserve their prosperity as long as possible; whereas to the Lacedaemonians, in their present misfortunes, it would be gain to run all hazards as quickly as possible.


5.46.2
3685
ἔπεισέ τε πέμψαι πρέσβεις , ὧν καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν , κελεύσοντας Λακεδαιμονίους , εἴ τι δίκαιον διανοοῦνται , Πάνακτόν τε ὀρθὸν ἀποδιδόναι καὶ Ἀμφίπολιν , καὶ τὴν Βοιωτῶν ξυμμαχίαν ἀνεῖναι , ἢν μὴ ἐς τὰς σπονδὰς ἐσίωσι , καθάπερ εἴρητο ἄνευ ἀλλήλων μηδενὶ ξυμβαίνειν .
So he prevailed on them to send ambassadors, of whom he was himself one, to bid the Lacedaemonians, if they had any just intentions, to restore Panactum standing, with Amphipolis, and to give up their alliance with the Boeotians, if they refused to accede to the treaty; as it had been stipulated that they should make peace with none but by mutual consent.


5.46.3
3686
εἰπεῖν τε ἐκέλευον ὅτι καὶ σφεῖς , εἰ ἐβούλοντο ἀδικεῖν , ἤδη ἂν Ἀργείους ξυμμάχους πεποιῆσθαι , ὡς παρεῖναί γ’ αὐτοὺς αὐτοῦ τούτου ἕνεκα .
They told them also to say, that they too, if they had wished to act unjustly, might have already taken the Argives for their allies, since they were come to them for that very purpose.


5.46.3
3687
εἴ τέ τι ἄλλο ἐνεκάλουν , πάντα ἐπιστείλαντες ἀπέπεμψαν τοὺς περὶ τὸν Νικίαν πρέσβεις .
And whatever complaint they had against them, they gave instructions on the subject to Nicias and his colleagues, and then sent them off.


5.46.4
3688
καὶ ἀφικομένων αὐτῶν καὶ ἀπαγγειλάντων τά τε ἄλλα καὶ τέλος εἰπόντων ὅτι εἰ μὴ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν ἀνήσουσι Βοιωτοῖς μὴ ἐσιοῦσιν ἐς τὰς σπονδάς , ποιήσονται καὶ αὐτοὶ Ἀργείους καὶ τοὺς μετ’ αὐτῶν ξυμμάχους , τὴν μὲν ξυμμαχίαν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι Βοιωτοῖς οὐκ ἔφασαν ἀνήσειν , ἐπικρατούντων τῶν περὶ τὸν Ξενάρη τὸν ἔφορον ταῦτα γίγνεσθαι καὶ ὅσοι ἄλλοι τῆς αὐτῆς γνώμης ἦσαν , τοὺς δὲ ὅρκους δεομένου Νικίου ἀνενεώσαντο ·
When they came there, and, after delivering their other messages, finally declared, that unless they gave up their alliance with the Boeotians, in case of their not acceding to the treaty, the Athenians also would take as their allies the Argives and those who joined them;


5.46.4
3689
ἐφοβεῖτο γὰρ μὴ πάντα ἀτελῆ ἔχων ἀπέλθῃ καὶ διαβληθῇ , ὅπερ καὶ ἐγένετο , αἴτιος δοκῶν εἶναι τῶν πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους σπονδῶν .
the Lacedaemonians refused to renounce the alliance with the Boeotians—the party of Xenares, the ephor, and all the rest who had the same views having sufficient influence to secure that,—but the oaths they renewed at the request of Nicias: for he was afraid of returning with all his objects unaccomplished, and of being exposed to censure, (as indeed was the case,) since he was considered as the author of the treaty with the Lacedaemonians.


5.46.5
3690
ἀναχωρήσαντός τε αὐτοῦ ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐδὲν ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος πεπραγμένον , εὐθὺς δι’ ὀργῆς εἶχον , καὶ νομίζοντες ἀδικεῖσθαι ( ἔτυχον γὰρ παρόντες οἱ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ) παραγαγόντος Ἀλκιβιάδου ἐποιήσαντο σπονδὰς καὶ ξυμμαχίαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς τήνδε .
On his return, when the Athenians heard that nothing had been done at Lacedaemonian, immediately they were enraged; and since they considered themselves injured, the Argives and their allies happening to be present, (having been introduced by Alcibiades,) they made a treaty and alliance with them on the following terms:


5.47.1
3691
&quot; σπονδὰς ἐποιήσαντο ἑκατὸν Ἀθηναῖοι ἔτη καὶ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ Μαντινῆς καὶ Ἠλεῖοι πρὸς ἀλλήλους , ὑπὲρ σφῶν αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὧν ἄρχουσιν ἑκάτεροι , ἀδόλους καὶ ἀβλαβεῖς καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν .
"The Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans made a treaty for a hundred years, on behalf of themselves and the allies in their respective dominions, to be observed without guile or injury, both by land and by sea.


5.47.2
3692
ὅπλα δὲ μὴ ἐξέστω ἐπιφέρειν ἐπὶ πημονῇ μήτε Ἀργείους καὶ Ἠλείους καὶ Μαντινέας καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐπὶ Ἀθηναίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ὧν ἄρχουσιν Ἀθηναῖοι μήτε Ἀθηναίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ὧν ἄρχουσιν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ Ἀργείους καὶ Ἠλείους καὶ Μαντινέας καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους , τέχνῃ μηδὲ μηχανῇ μηδεμιᾷ .
That it shall not be allowed to take up arms with a mischievous design, either for the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans, with their allies, against the Athenians, or for the Athenians and their allies against the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans, with their allies, by any means whatever.


5.47.3
3693
κατὰ τάδε ξυμμάχους εἶναι Ἀθηναίους καὶ Ἀργείους καὶ Μαντινέας καὶ Ἠλείους ἑκατὸν ἔτη .
"That the following are the terms on which the Athenians, Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall be allies for a hundred years.


5.47.3
3694
ἢν πολέμιοι ἴωσιν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τὴν Ἀθηναίων , βοηθεῖν Ἀργείους καὶ Μαντινέας καὶ Ἠλείους Ἀθήναζε , καθ’ ὅτι ἂν ἐπαγγέλλωσιν Ἀθηναῖοι , τρόπῳ ὁποίῳ ἂν δύνωνται ἰσχυροτάτῳ κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν ·
That in case of an enemy marching against the territory of the Athenians, the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall go to the succour of Athens, according to whatever message the Athenians may send them, in such manner as they can most effectually, to the utmost of their power.


5.47.3
3695
ἢν δὲ δῃώσαντες οἴχωνται , πολεμίαν εἶναι ταύτην τὴν πόλιν Ἀργείοις καὶ Μαντινεῦσι καὶ Ἠλείοις καὶ Ἀθηναίοις καὶ κακῶς πάσχειν ὑπὸ ἁπασῶν τῶν πόλεων τούτων ·
That in case of their having ravaged it and departed, that state shall be considered as an enemy to the Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, and shall be exposed to the vengeance of all these states;


5.47.3
3696
καταλύειν δὲ μὴ ἐξεῖναι τὸν πόλεμον πρὸς ταύτην τὴν πόλιν μηδεμιᾷ τῶν πόλεων , ἢν μὴ ἁπάσαις δοκῇ .
and that no one of them shall be at liberty to terminate hostilities with that state, unless they all think fit to do so.


5.47.4
3697
βοηθεῖν δὲ καὶ Ἀθηναίους ἐς Ἄργος καὶ Μαντίνειαν καὶ Ἦλιν , ἢν πολέμιοι ἴωσιν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τὴν Ἀργείων ἢ τὴν Μαντινέων ἢ τὴν Ἠλείων , καθ’ ὅτι ἂν ἐπαγγέλλωσιν αἱ πόλεις αὗται , τρόπῳ ὁποίῳ ἂν δύνωνται ἰσχυροτάτῳ κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν ·
That the Athenians likewise shall go to the succour of Argos Mantinea, and Elis, in case of an enemy marching against the Elean, Mantinean, or Argive territory, according to whatever message these states may send, in such manner as they can most effectually, to the utmost of their power.


5.47.4
3698
ἢν δὲ δῃώσαντες οἴχωνται , πολεμίαν εἶναι ταύτην τὴν πόλιν Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Ἀργείοις καὶ Μαντινεῦσι καὶ Ἠλείοις καὶ κακῶς πάσχειν ὑπὸ ἁπασῶν τούτων τῶν πόλεων ·
That in case of their having ravaged it and departed, that state shall be considered as an enemy to the Athenians, Eleans, Mantineans, and Argives, and shall be exposed to the vengeance of all of them;


5.47.4
3699
καταλύειν δὲ μὴ ἐξεῖναι τὸν πόλεμον πρὸς ταύτην τὴν πόλιν μηδεμιᾷ τῶν πόλεων , ἢν μὴ ἁπάσαις δοκῇ ταῖς πόλεσιν .
and that it shall not be lawful to terminate hostilities with that state, unless all the states think fit to do so.


5.47.5
3700
ὅπλα δὲ μὴ ἐᾶν ἔχοντας διιέναι ἐπὶ πολέμῳ διὰ τῆς γῆς τῆς σφετέρας αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὧν ἄρχουσιν ἕκαστοι , μηδὲ κατὰ θάλασσαν , ἢν μὴ ψηφισαμένων τῶν πόλεων ἁπασῶν τὴν δίοδον εἶναι , Ἀθηναίων καὶ Ἀργείων καὶ Μαντινέων καὶ Ἠλείων .
do so.  "That they shall not allow armed troops to pass for hostile purposes through their own land, or that of the allies in their respective dominions, nor by sea, unless all the states, the Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, have decreed that


5.47.6
3701
τοῖς δὲ βοηθοῦσιν ἡ πόλις ἡ πέμπουσα παρεχέτω μέχρι μὲν τριάκοντα ἡμερῶν σῖτον , ἐπὴν ἔλθωσιν ἐς τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἐπαγγείλασαν βοηθεῖν , καὶ ἀπιοῦσι κατὰ τ- αὐτά ·
That to the troops going as succours the state which sends them shall furnish provisions for thirty days after their arrival in the state which sent them word to succour it, and on their return in the same way:


5.47.6
3702
ἢν δὲ πλέονα βούληται χρόνον τῇ στρατιᾷ χρῆσθαι , ἡ πόλις ἡ μεταπεμψαμένη διδότω σῖτον , τῷ μὲν ὁπλίτῃ καὶ ψιλῷ καὶ τοξότῃ τρεῖς ὀβολοὺς Αἰγιναίους τῆς ἡμέρας ἑκάστης , τῷ δ’ ἱππεῖ δραχμὴν Αἰγιναίαν .
but that in case of their wishing to avail themselves of their service for a longer time, the state which sent for them shall supply them with provisions, at the rate of three Aeginetan oboli a day for a heavy-armed soldier, a light-armed, or a bowman, and of an Aeginetan drachma for a horseman.


5.47.7
3703
ἡ δὲ πόλις ἡ μεταπεμψαμένη τῇ στρατιᾷ τὴν ἡγεμονίαν ἐχέτω , ὅταν ἐν τῇ αὑτῆς ὁ πόλεμος ᾖ ·
That the state which sent for them shall have the command, while the war is in its own territory;


5.47.7
3704
ἢν δέ ποι δόξῃ ἁπάσαις ταῖς πόλεσι κοινῇ στρατεύεσθαι , τὸ ἴσον τῆς ἡγεμονίας μετεῖναι ἁπάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν .
but that in case of the states resolving to make a joint expedition in any quarter, an equal share of the command shall be enjoyed by all the states.


5.47.8
3705
ὀμόσαι δὲ τὰς σπονδὰς Ἀθηναίους μὲν ὑπέρ τε σφῶν αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων , Ἀργεῖοι δὲ καὶ Μαντινῆς καὶ Ἠλεῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι τούτων κατὰ πόλεις ὀμνύντων .
That the treaty shall be sworn to, by the Athenians on behalf both of themselves and their allies, but on the part of the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and their allies, by each several state.


5.47.8
3706
ὀμνύντων δὲ τὸν ἐπιχώριον ὅρκον ἕκαστοι τὸν μέγιστον κατὰ ἱερῶν τελείων .
That they shall swear that oath respectively which is the most binding in their country, over full-grown victims;


5.47.8
3707
ὁ δὲ ὅρκος ἔστω ὅδε ·
and the oath shall be to this effect;


5.47.8
3708
&quot; ἐμμενῶ τῇ ξυμμαχίᾳ κατὰ τὰ ξυγκείμενα δικαίως καὶ ἀβλαβῶς καὶ ἀδόλως , καὶ οὐ παραβήσομαι τέχνῃ οὐδὲ μηχανῇ οὐδεμιᾷ &quot; .
'I will stand by this alliance according to the stipulations, honestly, without injury, and without guile, and will not violate it by any method or means whatever.'


5.47.9
3709
ὀμνύντων δὲ Ἀθήνησι μὲν ἡ βουλὴ καὶ αἱ ἔνδημοι ἀρχαί , ἐξορκούντων δὲ οἱ πρυτάνεις ·
That the persons to take the oath shall be, at Athens, the council and the home magistrates, the prytanes administering it;


5.47.9
3710
ἐν Ἄργει δὲ ἡ βουλὴ καὶ οἱ ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ οἱ ἀρτῦναι , ἐξορκούντων δὲ οἱ ὀγδοήκοντα ·
at Argos, the council, the eighty, and the artynae, the eighty administering it;


5.47.9
3711
ἐν δὲ Μαντινείᾳ οἱ δημιουργοὶ καὶ ἡ βουλὴ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀρχαί , ἐξορκούντων δὲ οἱ θεωροὶ καὶ οἱ πολέμαρχοι ·
at Mantinea, the demiourgoi, the council, and the other magistrates, the theoroi and the polemarchs administering it;


5.47.9
3712
ἐν δὲ Ἤλιδι οἱ δημιουργοὶ καὶ οἱ τὰ τέλη ἔχοντες καὶ οἱ ἑξακόσιοι , ἐξορκούντων δὲ οἱ δημιουργοὶ καὶ οἱ θεσμοφύλακες .
at Elis, the demiourgoi, the magistrates, and the six hundred, the demiourgoi and the thesmophylakes administering it.


5.47.10
3713
ἀνανεοῦσθαι δὲ τοὺς ὅρκους Ἀθηναίους μὲν ἰόντας ἐς Ἦλιν καὶ ἐς Μαντίνειαν καὶ ἐς Ἄργος τριάκοντα ἡμέραις πρὸ Ὀλυμπίων , Ἀργείους δὲ καὶ Ἠλείους καὶ Μαντινέας ἰόντας Ἀθήναζε δέκα ἡμέραις πρὸ Παναθηναίων τῶν μεγάλων .
hundred, the  and  administering it. That the oaths shall be renewed by the Athenians, on going to Elis, Mantinea, and Argos, thirty days before the Olympic festival; by the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans, on going to Athens,


5.47.11
3714
τὰς δὲ ξυνθήκας τὰς περὶ τῶν σπονδῶν καὶ τῶν ὅρκων καὶ τῆς ξυμμαχίας ἀναγράψαι ἐν στήλῃ λιθίνῃ Ἀθηναίους μὲν ἐν πόλει , Ἀργείους δὲ ἐν ἀγορᾷ ἐν τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τῷ ἱερῷ , Μαντινέας δὲ ἐν τοῦ Διὸς τῷ ἱερῷ ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ·
That the stipulations respecting the treaty, the oaths, and the alliance, shall be inscribed on a stone pillar, by the Athenians, in the citadel;


5.47.11
3715
καταθέντων δὲ καὶ Ὀλυμπίασι στήλην χαλκῆν κοινῇ Ὀλυμπίοις τοῖς νυνί .
by the Argives, in the market-place, in the temple of Apollo; by the Mantineans, in the temple of Jupiter in the market-place: and that a brazen pillar shall be erected at their common expense at Olympia, by the Olympic games.


5.47.12
3716
ἐὰν δέ τι δοκῇ ἄμεινον εἶναι ταῖς πόλεσι ταύταις προσθεῖναι πρὸς τοῖς ξυγκειμένοις , ὅτι δ’ ἂν δόξῃ ταῖς πόλεσιν ἁπάσαις κοινῇ βουλευομέναις , τοῦτο κύριον εἶναι &quot; .
" joint expense at Olympia, at the present festival. That should these states think it better to make any addition to the articles agreed on, whatever seems fit to all the states, on holding common deliberation, that shall be binding."


5.48.1
3717
αἱ μὲν σπονδαὶ καὶ ἡ ξυμμαχία οὕτως ἐγένοντο , καὶ αἱ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Ἀθηναίων οὐκ ἀπείρηντο τούτου ἕνεκα οὐδ’ ὑφ’ ἑτέρων .
In this way were the treaty and alliances concluded; and yet that between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians was not renounced on this account by either party.


5.48.2
3718
Κορίνθιοι δὲ Ἀργείων ὄντες ξύμμαχοι οὐκ ἐσῆλθον ἐς αὐτάς , ἀλλὰ καὶ γενομένης πρὸ τούτου Ἠλείοις καὶ Ἀργείοις καὶ Μαντινεῦσι ξυμμαχίας , τοῖς αὐτοῖς πολεμεῖν καὶ εἰρήνην ἄγειν , οὐ ξυνώμοσαν , ἀρκεῖν δ’ ἔφασαν σφίσι τὴν πρώτην γενομένην ἐπιμαχίαν , ἀλλήλοις βοηθεῖν , ξυνεπιστρατεύειν δὲ μηδενί .
But though the Corinthians were allies of the Argives, they did not accede to the new treaty. Nay, before this time, when an alliance was formed between the Eleans, Argives, and Mantineans, to be at war and peace with the same states, they did not join the league, but said that they were content with the first alliance which had been made for purposes of defence, on condition of succouring one another, but not joining to attack any party.


5.48.3
3719
οἱ μὲν Κορίνθιοι οὕτως ἀπέστησαν τῶν ξυμμάχων καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους πάλιν τὴν γνώμην εἶχον .
The Corinthians, then, thus stood aloof from their allies, and turned their thoughts again towards the Lacedaemonians.


5.49.1
3720
Ὀλύμπια δ’ ἐγένετο τοῦ θέρους τούτου , οἷς Ἀνδροσθένης Ἀρκὰς παγκράτιον τὸ πρῶτον ἐνίκα ·
The Olympic festival was held this summer, that at which Androsthenes the Arcadian was victor the first time in the pancratium.


5.49.1
3721
καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τοῦ ἱεροῦ ὑπὸ Ἠλείων εἴρχθησαν ὥστε μὴ θύειν μηδ’ ἀγωνίζεσθαι , οὐκ ἐκτίνοντες τὴν δίκην αὐτοῖς ἣν ἐν τῷ Ὀλυμπιακῷ νόμῳ Ἠλεῖοι κατεδικάσαντο αὐτῶν φάσκοντες ἐς σφᾶς ἐπὶ Φύρκον τε τεῖχος ὅπλα ἐπενεγκεῖν καὶ ἐς Λέπρεον αὐτῶν ὁπλίτας ἐν ταῖς Ὀλυμπιακαῖς σπονδαῖς ἐσπέμψαι .
The Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the Eleans, so that they could neither sacrifice nor enter the lists, as refusing to pay the fine to which the Eleans, by virtue of the Olympian law, had condemned them, alleging that they had attacked the fortress of Phyrcus, and sent a body of their heavy-armed into Lepreum during the Olympic truce.


5.49.1
3722
ἡ δὲ καταδίκη δισχίλιαι μναῖ ἦσαν , κατὰ τὸν ὁπλίτην ἕκαστον δύο μναῖ , ὥσπερ ὁ νόμος ἔχει .
The fine imposed upon them was two thousand mine, being two for each heavy-armed soldier, as the law ordains.


5.49.2
3723
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ πρέσβεις πέμψαντες ἀντέλεγον μὴ δικαίως σφῶν καταδεδικάσθαι , λέγοντες μὴ ἐπηγγέλθαι πω ἐς Λακεδαίμονα τὰς σπονδάς , ὅτ’ ἐσέπεμψαν τοὺς ὁπλίτας .
declaring that the truce had not yet been proclaimed at Lacedaemon, when they sent their troops into Lepreum.


5.49.3
3724
Ἠλεῖοι δὲ τὴν παρ’ αὐτοῖς ἐκεχειρίαν ἤδη ἔφασαν εἶναι ( πρώτοις γὰρ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἐπαγγέλλουσιν ) , καὶ ἡσυχαζόντων σφῶν καὶ οὐ προσδεχομένων ὡς ἐν σπονδαῖς , αὐτοὺς λαθεῖν ἀδικήσαντας .
The Eleans, however, maintained that the cessation of arms in their country had already commenced, (for they proclaim it amongst themselves first,) and that while they were living in quiet, and not expecting any thing, as it was time of truce, the Lacedaemonians had committed an injury upon them by surprise.


5.49.4
3725
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ὑπελάμβανον οὐ χρεὼν εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἐπαγγεῖλαι ἔτι ἐς Λακεδαίμονα , εἰ ἀδικεῖν γε ἤδη ἐνόμιζον αὐτούς , ἀλλ’ οὐχ ὡς νομίζοντας τοῦτο δρᾶσαι , καὶ ὅπλα οὐδαμόσε ἔτι αὐτοῖς ἐπενεγκεῖν .
The Lacedaemonians replied, that there was no need of the Eleans having still proclaimed the truce at Lacedaemon, if they had thought them already guilty of injustice; but they had done so, as not thinking it; and they themselves had no longer gone any where to attack them.


5.49.5
3726
Ἠλεῖοι δὲ τοῦ αὐτοῦ λόγου εἴχοντο , ὡς μὲν οὐκ ἀδικοῦσι μὴ ἂν πεισθῆναι , εἰ δὲ βούλονται σφίσι Λέπρεον ἀποδοῦναι , τό τε αὑτῶν μέρος ἀφιέναι τοῦ ἀργυρίου , καὶ ὃ τῷ θεῷ γίγνεται αὐτοὶ ὑπὲρ ἐκείνων ἐκτίσειν .
The Eleans. however, adhered to the same statement, namely, that they could never be persuaded that they were not guilty; but that if they would restore Lepreum to them, they were ready to give up their own share of the money, and would themselves pay for them that which fell to the god.


5.50.1
3727
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἐσήκουον , αὖθις τάδε ἠξίουν , Λέπρεον μὲν μὴ ἀποδοῦναι , εἰ μὴ βούλονται , ἀναβάντας δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν βωμὸν τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ Ὀλυμπίου , ἐπειδὴ προθυμοῦνται χρῆσθαι τῷ ἱερῷ , ἐπομόσαι ἐναντίον τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἦ μὴν ἀποδώσειν ὕστερον τὴν καταδίκην .
When they did not comply, they required them again to do as follows: not to give back Lepreum, if they objected to it, but to mount on the altar of the Olympian Jupiter—since they were so anxious to have access to the temple—and swear before the Greeks that assuredly they would discharge the fine at a future period.


5.50.2
3728
ὡς δὲ οὐδὲ ταῦτα ἤθελον , Λακεδαιμόνιοι μὲν εἴργοντο τοῦ ἱεροῦ θυσίας καὶ ἀγώνων καὶ οἴκοι ἔθυον , οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες ἐθεώρουν πλὴν Λεπρεατῶν .
But when they would not do this either, the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple—from the sacrifice and from the games—and made their offerings at home;


5.50.3
3729
ὅμως δὲ οἱ Ἠλεῖοι δεδιότες μὴ βίᾳ θύσωσι , ξὺν ὅπλοις τῶν νεωτέρων φυλακὴν εἶχον ·
However, the Eleans were afraid of their sacrificing by force, and kept guard with a heavy-armed company of their young men;


5.50.3
3730
ἦλθον δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ Μαντινῆς , χίλιοι ἑκατέρων , καὶ Ἀθηναίων ἱππῆς , οἳ ἐν Ἁρπίνῃ ὑπέμενον τὴν ἑορτήν .
while there also came to them a body of Argives and Mantineans, each a thousand strong, and some Athenian cavalry, that were at Argos, waiting for the festival.


5.50.4
3731
δέος δ’ ἐγένετο τῇ πανηγύρει μέγα μὴ ξὺν ὅπλοις ἔλθωσιν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐπειδὴ καὶ Λίχας ὁ Ἀρκεσιλάου Λακεδαιμόνιος ἐν τῷ ἀγῶνι ὑπὸ τῶν ῥαβδούχων πληγὰς ἔλαβεν , ὅτι νικῶντος τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ ζεύγους καὶ ἀνακηρυχθέντος Βοιωτῶν δημοσίου κατὰ τὴν οὐκ ἐξουσίαν τῆς ἀγωνίσεως προελθὼν ἐς τὸν ἀγῶνα ἀνέδησε τὸν ἡνίοχον , βουλόμενος δηλῶσαι ὅτι ἑαυτοῦ ἦν τὸ ἅρμα ·
And a great alarm was produced in the assembly lest the Lacedaemonians should come in arms; especially after Lichas son of Arcesilaus, a Lacedaemonian, was scourged on the course by the lictors, because, on his horses being the winners, and the Boeotian people being proclaimed victor, on account of his having no right to enter the lists, he came forward on to the course, and crowned the charioteer, from a wish to show that the chariot was his.


5.50.4
3732
ὥστε πολλῷ δὴ μᾶλλον ἐπεφόβηντο πάντες καὶ ἐδόκει τι νέον ἔσεσθαι .
All therefore were now much more afraid, and thought there would be some disturbance.


5.50.4
3733
οἱ μέντοι Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἡσύχασάν τε καὶ ἡ ἑορτὴ αὐτοῖς οὕτω διῆλθεν .
However, the Lacedaemonians kept quiet, and let the feast thus pass by.


5.50.5
3734
ἐς δὲ Κόρινθον μετὰ τὰ Ὀλύμπια Ἀργεῖοί τε καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἀφίκοντο δεησόμενοι αὐτῶν παρὰ σφᾶς ἐλθεῖν .
After the Olympic festival, the Argives and their allies repaired to Corinth, to beg that state to come over to them.


5.50.5
3735
καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων πρέσβεις ἔτυχον παρόντες , καὶ πολλῶν λόγων γενομένων τέλος οὐδὲν ἐπράχθη , ἀλλὰ σεισμοῦ γενομένου διελύθησαν ἕκαστοι ἐπ’ οἴκου .
Some Lacedaemonian ambassadors, too, happened to be there; and after there had been much discussion, nothing was accomplished at last; but an earthquake having occurred, they dispersed to their several homes.


5.50.5
3736
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And so the summer ended.


5.51.1
3737
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος Ἡρακλεώταις τοῖς ἐν Τραχῖνι μάχη ἐγένετο πρὸς Αἰνιᾶνας καὶ Δόλοπας καὶ Μηλιᾶς καὶ Θεσσαλῶν τινάς .
The following winter the Heracleans in Trachinia fought a battle with the Aenianians, Dolopians, Maleans, and some of the Thessalians.


5.51.2
3738
προσοικοῦντα γὰρ τὰ ἔθνη ταῦτα τῇ πόλει πολέμια ἦν ·
For these nations were bordering on, and hostile to, their city;


5.51.2
3739
οὐ γὰρ ἐπ’ ἄλλῃ τινὶ γῇ ἢ τῇ τούτων τὸ χωρίον ἐτειχίσθη .
as it was against no other country but theirs that the place was fortified.


5.51.2
3740
καὶ εὐθύς τε καθισταμένῃ τῇ πόλει ἠναντιοῦντο ἐς ὅσον ἐδύναντο φθείροντες καὶ τότε τῇ μάχῃ ἐνίκησαν τοὺς Ἡρακλεώτας , καὶ Ξενάρης ὁ Κνίδιος Λακεδαιμόνιος ἄρχων αὐτῶν ἀπέθανε , διεφθάρησαν δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι τῶν Ἡρακλεωτῶν .
Accordingly they opposed the city on its first settlement, by annoying it as far as they could; and at this time they defeated the Heracleans in the engagement, Xenares son of Cnidis, a Lacedaemonian, being slain, and others of the Heracleans also cut off.


5.51.2
3741
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ δωδέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα .
And thus the winter ended, and the twelfth year of the war.


5.52.1
3742
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους εὐθὺς ἀρχομένου τὴν Ἡράκλειαν , ὡς μετὰ τὴν μάχην κακῶς ἐφθείρετο , Βοιωτοὶ παρέλαβον , καὶ Ἀγησιππίδαν τὸν Λακεδαιμόνιον ὡς οὐ καλῶς ἄρχοντα ἐξέπεμψαν .
At the very commencement of the following summer, the Boeotians seized on Heraclea, when it was miserably reduced after the battle, and sent away Hegesippidas the Lacedaemonian, on the charge of governing it ill.


5.52.1
3743
δείσαντες δὲ παρέλαβον τὸ χωρίον μὴ Λακεδαιμονίων τὰ κατὰ Πελοπόννησον θορυβουμένων Ἀθηναῖοι λάβωσιν ·
They occupied the place through fear that, while the Lacedaemonians were distracted with the affairs of the Peloponnese, the Athenians might take it.


5.52.1
3744
Λακεδαιμόνιοι μέντοι ὠργίζοντο αὐτοῖς .
The Lacedaemonians, however, were offended with them for what they had done.


5.52.2
3745
καὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους Ἀλκιβιάδης ὁ Κλεινίου στρατηγὸς ὢν Ἀθηναίων , Ἀργείων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ξυμπρασσόντων , ἐλθὼν ἐς Πελοπόννησον μετ’ ὀλίγων Ἀθηναίων ὁπλιτῶν καὶ τοξοτῶν καὶ τῶν αὐτόθεν ξυμμάχων παραλαβὼν τά τε ἄλλα ξυγκαθίστη περὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν διαπορευόμενος Πελοπόννησον τῇ στρατιᾷ , καὶ Πατρέας τε τείχη καθεῖναι ἔπεισεν ἐς θάλασσαν καὶ αὐτὸς ἕτερον διενοεῖτο τειχίσαι ἐπὶ τῷ Ῥίῳ τῷ Ἀχαϊκῷ .
The same summer, Alcibiades son of Clinias, being one of the generals at Athens, having the co-operation of the Argives and the allies, went into the Peloponnese with a few Athenian heavy-armed and bowmen;


5.52.2
3746
Κορίνθιοι δὲ καὶ Σικυώνιοι , καὶ οἷς ἦν ἐν βλάβῃ τειχισθὲν βοηθήσαντες διεκώλυσαν .
and taking with him some of the allies in those parts, both proceeded to settle in concert with them other matters connected with the alliance, marching about the Peloponnese with his troops, and persuaded the Patreans to carry their walls down to the sea; intending also himself to build a fort beside the Achaean Rhium. But the Corinthians and Sicyonians, and all to whose injury it would have been built, came against him, and prevented his doing it.


5.53.1
3747
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους Ἐπιδαυρίοις καὶ Ἀργείοις πόλεμος ἐγένετο , προφάσει μὲν περὶ τοῦ θύματος τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τοῦ Πυθαέως , ὃ δέον ἀπαγαγεῖν οὐκ ἀπέπεμπον ὑπὲρ βοταμίων Ἐπιδαύριοι ( κυριώτατοι δὲ τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἦσαν Ἀργεῖοι ) ·
The same summer a war broke out between the Epidaurians and Argives;


5.53.1
3748
ἐδόκει δὲ καὶ ἄνευ τῆς αἰτίας τὴν Ἐπίδαυρον τῷ τε Ἀλκιβιάδῃ καὶ τοῖς Ἀργείοις προσλαβεῖν , ἢν δύνωνται , τῆς τε Κορίνθου ἕνεκα ἡσυχίας καὶ ἐκ τῆς Αἰγίνης βραχυτέραν ἔσεσθαι τὴν βοήθειαν ἢ Σκύλλαιον περιπλεῖν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις .
nominally, about the offering to Apollo Pythaeus, which the Epidaurians were bound to make, but did not, for certain lands by the river side; (the Argives had the chief management of the temple;) but even independently of this charge, Alcibiades and the Argives thought it desirable to get possession of Epidaurus, if they could; both to insure the neutrality of Corinth, and thinking that the Athenians would find it a shorter passage for their succours through Aegina, than by sailing round Scyllaeum.


5.53.1
3749
παρεσκευάζοντο οὖν οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ὡς αὐτοὶ ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαυρον διὰ τοῦ θύματος τὴν ἔσπραξιν ἐσβαλοῦντες .
The Argives therefore prepared to invade Epidaurus by themselves, in order to exact the offering.


5.54.1
3750
ἐξεστράτευσαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι κατὰ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους πανδημεὶ ἐς Λεῦκτρα τῆς ἑαυτῶν μεθορίας πρὸς τὸ Λύκαιον , Ἄγιδος τοῦ Ἀρχιδάμου βασιλέως ἡγουμένου ·
The Lacedaemonians, too, at the same time marched out with all their forces to Leuctra, on their own borders, opposite Mount Lyaeum, under the command of Agis son of Archidamus, their king;


5.54.1
3751
ᾔδει δὲ οὐδεὶς ὅποι στρατεύουσιν , οὐδὲ αἱ πόλεις ἐξ ὧν ἐπέμφθησαν .
but no one knew what was their destination, not even the cities from which contingents were sent.


5.54.2
3752
ὡς δ’ αὐτοῖς τὰ διαβατήρια θυομένοις οὐ προυχώρει , αὐτοί τε ἀπῆλθον ἐπ’ οἴκου καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις περιήγγειλαν μετὰ τὸν μέλλοντα ( Καρνεῖος δ’ ἦν μήν , ἱερομηνία Δωριεῦσι ) παρασκευάζεσθαι ὡς στρατευσομένους .
When, however, the omens from their sacrifices were not favourable for crossing the border, they both returned home themselves, and sent word to their allies to prepare to take the field after the ensuing month; (that being the month Carneus, a holy period amongst the Dorians).


5.54.3
3753
Ἀργεῖοι δ’ ἀναχωρησάντων αὐτῶν τοῦ πρὸ τοῦ Καρνείου μηνὸς ἐξελθόντες τετράδι φθίνοντος , καὶ ἄγοντες τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην πάντα τὸν χρόνον , ἐσέβαλον ἐς τὴν Ἐπιδαυρίαν καὶ ἐδῄουν .
On their retiring, the Argives marched out on the 26th of the month preceding Carneus; and advancing that day the whole of the time invaded the Epidaurian territory, and proceeded to lay it waste


5.54.4
3754
Ἐπιδαύριοι δὲ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἐπεκαλοῦντο ·
The Epidaurians invoked the aid of their allies;


5.54.4
3755
ὧν τινὲς οἱ μὲν τὸν μῆνα προυφασίσαντο , οἱ δὲ καὶ ἐς μεθορίαν τῆς Ἐπιδαυρίας ἐλθόντες ἡσύχαζον .
but some of them pleaded the month as an excuse, while others, even after coming to the borders of Epidaurus, remained inactive.


5.55.1
3756
καὶ καθ’ ὃν χρόνον ἐν τῇ Ἐπιδαύρῳ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ἦσαν , ἐς Μαντίνειαν πρεσβεῖαι ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων ξυνῆλθον , Ἀθηναίων παρακαλεσάντων .
At the time that the Argives were in Epidaurus, deputations from the states assembled at Mantinea, on the invitation of the Athenians.


5.55.1
3757
καὶ γιγνομένων λόγων Εὐφαμίδας ὁ Κορίνθιος οὐκ ἔφη τοὺς λόγους τοῖς ἔργοις ὁμολογεῖν ·
And when the conference began, the Corinthians said that their words did not agree with their deeds;


5.55.1
3758
σφεῖς μὲν γὰρ περὶ εἰρήνης ξυγκαθῆσθαι , τοὺς δ’ Ἐπιδαυρίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους καὶ τοὺς Ἀργείους μεθ’ ὅπλων ἀντιτετάχθαι ·
since they were sitting in council on the subject of peace, while the Epidaurians with their allies and the Argives were arrayed against each other under arms.


5.55.1
3759
διαλῦσαι οὖν πρῶτον χρῆναι ἀφ’ ἑκατέρων ἐλθόντας τὰ στρατόπεδα , καὶ οὕτω πάλιν λέγειν περὶ τῆς εἰρήνης .
Deputies therefore from each party ought first to go and separate the armies, and then come and speak again on the subject of peace.


5.55.2
3760
καὶ πεισθέντες ᾤχοντο καὶ τοὺς Ἀργείους ἀπήγαγον ἐκ τῆς Ἐπιδαυρίας .
In compliance with this sentiment, they went and brought back the Argives out of the Epidaurian territory.


5.55.2
3761
ὕστερον δὲ ἐς τὸ αὐτὸ ξυνελθόντες οὐδ’ ὣς ἐδυνήθησαν ξυμβῆναι , ἀλλ’ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι πάλιν ἐς τὴν Ἐπιδαυρίαν ἐσέβαλον καὶ ἐδῄουν .
They then assembled again, but could not even then come to any agreement; but the Argives again invaded Epidaurus, and laid it waste. The Lacedaemonians, too, marched out to Caryae;


5.55.3
3762
ἐξεστράτευσαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐς Καρύας ,καὶ ὡς οὐδ’ ἐνταῦθα τὰ διαβατήρια αὐτοῖς ἐγένετο , ἐπανεχώρησαν .
and returned again, when the omens on that occasion also proved unfavourable to them.


5.55.4
3763
Ἀργεῖοι δὲ τεμόντες τῆς Ἐπιδαυρίας ὡς τὸ τρίτον μέρος ἀπῆλθον ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The Argives, after ravaging about a third of the Epidaurian territory, returned home.


5.55.4
3764
καὶ Ἀθηναίων αὐτοῖς χίλιοι ἐβοήθησαν ὁπλῖται καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδης στρατηγός ·
Moreover, a thousand heavy-armed of the Athenians had come to their assistance, with Alcibiades as general;


5.55.4
3765
πυθόμενος δὲ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἐξεστρατεῦσθαι , καὶ ὡς οὐδὲν ἔτι αὐτῶν ἔδει , ἀπῆλθεν .
but on learning that the Lacedaemonians had ended their expedition, and that there was no longer any need for them, they returned home.


5.55.4
3766
καὶ τὸ θέρος οὕτω διῆλθεν .
And so the summer passed by.


5.56.1
3767
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος Λακεδαιμόνιοι λαθόντες Ἀθηναίους φρουρούς τε τριακοσίους καὶ Ἀγησιππίδαν ἄρχοντα κατὰ θάλασσαν ἐς Ἐπίδαυρον ἐσέπεμψαν .
The following winter, the Lacedaemonians eluded the vigilance of the Athenians in sending by sea to Epidaurus three hundred garrison troops, under command of Agesippidas.


5.56.2
3768
Ἀργεῖοι δ’ ἐλθόντες παρ’ Ἀθηναίους ἐπεκάλουν ὅτι γεγραμμένον ἐν ταῖς σπονδαῖς διὰ τῆς ἑαυτῶν ἑκάστους μὴ ἐᾶν πολεμίους διιέναι ἐάσειαν κατὰ θάλασσαν παραπλεῦσαι ·
The Argives therefore went to the Athenians, and complained, that though it had been specified in the treaty that they should not allow an enemy to pass through their respective countries, they had allowed them to go there by sea;


5.56.2
3769
καὶ εἰ μὴ κ- ἐκεῖνοι ἐς Πύλον κομιοῦσιν ἐπὶ Λακεδαιμονίους τοὺς Μεσσηνίους καὶ Εἵλωτας , ἀδικήσεσθαι αὐτοί .
and therefore they should consider themselves aggrieved, if the Athenians, on their side, did not take the Messenians and helots to Pylus, to annoy the Lacedaemonians.


5.56.3
3770
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδου πείσαντος τῇ μὲν Λακωνικῇ στήλῃ ὑπέγραψαν ὅτι οὐκ ἐνέμειναν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τοῖς ὅρκοις , ἐς δὲ Πύλον ἐκόμισαν τοὺς ἐκ Κρανίων Εἵλωτας λῄζεσθαι , τὰ δ’ ἄλλα ἡσύχαζον .
So the Athenians, at the instigation of Alcibiades, inscribed at the bottom of the Laconian pillar, that the Lacedaemonians had not adhered to their oaths; and they conveyed the helots who were at Cranii to Pylus, to plunder the country;


5.56.4
3771
τὸν δὲ χειμῶνα τοῦτον πολεμούντων Ἀργείων καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίων μάχη μὲν οὐδεμία ἐγένετο ἐκ παρασκευῆς , ἐνέδραι δὲ καὶ καταδρομαί , ἐν αἷς ὡς τύχοιεν ἑκατέρων τινὲς διεφθείροντο .
though in other respects they remained quiet. Now in the course of hostilities during this winter between the Argives and Epidaurians, no pitched battle was fought, but there were only ambuscades and skirmishes, in which some were slain on each side, as might happen.


5.56.5
3772
καὶ τελευτῶντος τοῦ χειμῶνος πρὸς ἔαρ ἤδη κλίμακας ἔχοντες οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὴν Ἐπίδαυρον , ὡς ἐρήμου οὔσης διὰ τὸν πόλεμον βίᾳ αἱρήσοντες ·
When the winter was closing, and spring was now at hand, the Argives went with scaling ladders to Epidaurus, supposing that it would be left unguarded on account of the war, and intending to take it by storm;


5.56.5
3773
καὶ ἄπρακτοι ἀπῆλθον .
but returned unsuccessful.


5.56.5
3774
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ τρίτον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα .
And thus the winter ended, and the thirteenth year of this war.


5.57.1
3775
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους μεσοῦντος Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ὡς αὐτοῖς οἵ τε Ἐπιδαύριοι ξύμμαχοι ὄντες ἐταλαιπώρουν καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ τὰ μὲν ἀφειστήκει , τὰ δ’ οὐ καλῶς εἶχε , νομίσαντες , εἰ μὴ προκαταλήψονται ἐν τάχει , ἐπὶ πλέον χωρήσεσθαι αὐτά , ἐστράτευον αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ Εἵλωτες πανδημεὶ ἐπ’ Ἄργος ·
In the middle of the next summer, when the Lacedaemonians saw that the Epidaurians, who were their allies, were in distress, and that the other states in the Peloponnese had either separated from them, or were unfavourably disposed towards them;


5.57.1
3776
ἡγεῖτο δὲ Ἆγις ὁ Ἀρχιδάμου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς .
thinking that if they did not quickly prevent it, they would proceed to a greater degree of disaffection, they marched with all their forces, themselves and the helots, against Argos, under the command of Agis son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians.


5.57.2
3777
ξυνεστράτευον δ’ αὐτοῖς Τεγεᾶταί τε καὶ ὅσοι ἄλλοι Ἀρκάδων Λακεδαιμονίοις ξύμμαχοι ἦσαν .
They were accompanied by the Tegeans, and as many others of the Arcadians as were in alliance with them.


5.57.2
3778
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς ἄλλης Πελοποννήσου ξύμμαχοι καὶ οἱ ἔξωθεν ἐς Φλειοῦντα ξυνελέγοντο , Βοιωτοὶ μὲν πεντακισχίλιοι ὁπλῖται καὶ τοσοῦτοι ψιλοὶ καὶ ἱππῆς πεντακόσιοι καὶ ἅμιπποι ἴσοι , Κορίνθιοι δὲ δισχίλιοι ὁπλῖται , οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ὡς ἕκαστοι , Φλειάσιοι δὲ πανστρατιᾷ , ὅτι ἐν τῇ ἐκείνων ἦν τὸ στράτευμα .
The allies in the rest of the Peloponnese also, and those beyond it, mustered at Phlius; the Boeotians with five thousand heavy-armed, the same number of light-armed, five hundred cavalry, and an equal number of the Corinthians with two thousand heavy-armed; the rest as might severally happen; but the Phliasians in full force, as the army was posted in their country.


5.58.1
3779
Ἀργεῖοι δὲ προαισθόμενοι τό τε πρῶτον τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐς τὸν Φλειοῦντα βουλόμενοι τοῖς ἄλλοις προσμεῖξαι ἐχώρουν , τότε δὴ ἐξεστράτευσαν καὶ αὐτοί ·
Now the Argives had from the first been aware of the preparations of the Lacedaemonians;


5.58.1
3780
ἐβοήθησαν δ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ Μαντινῆς , ἔχοντες τοὺς σφετέρους ξυμμάχους , καὶ Ἠλείων τρισχίλιοι ὁπλῖται .
and when they were on their march for the purpose of joining the rest at Phlius, then they also took the field. They were reinforced by the Mantineans with their allies, and by three thousand heavy-armed of the Eleans.


5.58.2
3781
καὶ προϊόντες ἀπαντῶσι τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐν Μεθυδρίῳ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας .
And as they advanced, they met the Lacedaemonians at Methydrium in Arcadia, and each army occupied a hill.


5.58.2
3782
καὶ καταλαμβάνουσιν ἑκάτεροι λόφον ·
The Argives then prepared to engage the Lacedaemonians, cut off as they were by themselves;


5.58.2
3783
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀργεῖοι ὡς μεμονωμένοις τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις παρεσκευάζοντο μάχεσθαι , ὁ δὲ Ἆγις τῆς νυκτὸς ἀναστήσας τὸν στρατὸν καὶ λαθὼν ἐπορεύετο ἐς Φλειοῦντα παρὰ τοὺς ἄλλους ξυμμάχους .
but Agis broke up in the night, and eluding them, proceeded to the rest of the allies at Phlius.


5.58.3
3784
καὶ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι αἰσθόμενοι ἅμα ἕῳ ἐχώρουν , πρῶτον μὲν ἐς Ἄργος , ἔπειτα δὲ ᾗ προσεδέχοντο τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους μετὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων καταβήσεσθαι , τὴν κατὰ Νεμέαν ὁδόν .
The Argives, on finding this, marched, as soon as it was morning, to Argos first, and then to where they expected the Lacedaemonians with their allies would descend into their country, namely, the road running by Nemea.


5.58.4
3785
Ἆγις δὲ ταύτην μὲν ἣν προσεδέχοντο οὐκ ἐτράπετο , παραγγείλας δὲ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀρκάσι καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίοις ἄλλην ἐχώρησε χαλεπὴν καὶ κατέβη ἐς τὸ Ἀργείων πεδίον ·
Agis, however, did not take that road, as they expected him to do; but having given orders to the Lacedaemonians, Arcadians, and Epidaurians, he advanced by another and more difficult route, and so came down into the plain of Argos.


5.58.4
3786
καὶ Κορίνθιοι καὶ Πελληνῆς καὶ Φλειάσιοι ὄρθιον ἑτέραν ἐπορεύοντο ·
The Corinthians, Pellenians, and Phliasians marched by another steep road;


5.58.4
3787
τοῖς δὲ Βοιωτοῖς καὶ Μεγαρεῦσι καὶ Σικυωνίοις εἴρητο τὴν ἐπὶ Νεμέας ὁδὸν καταβαίνειν , ᾗ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ἐκάθηντο , ὅπως , εἰ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ἐπὶ σφᾶς ἰόντες ἐς τὸ πεδίον βοηθοῖεν , ἐφεπόμενοι τοῖς ἵπποις χρῷντο .
while the Boeotians, Megareans, and Sicyonians had been ordered to descend by that leading to Nemea, where the Argives were posted, in order that, if the Argives should advance into the plain against his own division, they might hang on their rear, and use their cavalry with effect.


5.58.5
3788
καὶ ὁ μὲν οὕτω διατάξας καὶ ἐσβαλὼν ἐς τὸ πεδίον ἐδῄου Σάμινθόν τε καὶ ἄλλα ·
He then, having made these arrangements and entered the plain, proceeded to ravage Saminthus and other places.


5.59.1
3789
οἱ δὲ Ἀργεῖοι γνόντες ἐβοήθουν ἡμέρας ἤδη ἐκ τῆς Νεμέας , καὶ περιτυχόντες τῷ Φλειασίων καὶ Κορινθίων στρατοπέδῳ τῶν μὲν Φλειασίων ὀλίγους ἀπέκτειναν , ὑπὸ δὲ τῶν Κορινθίων αὐτοὶ οὐ πολλῷ πλείους διεφθάρησαν .
The Argives, having discovered it, advanced from Nemea, when it was now day, to their succour; and falling in with the forces of the Phliasians and Corinthians, killed a few of the former, but themselves had rather more killed by the latter.


5.59.2
3790
καὶ οἱ Βοιωτοὶ καὶ οἱ Μεγαρῆς καὶ οἱ Σικυώνιοι ἐχώρουν , ὥσπερ εἴρητο αὐτοῖς , ἐπὶ τῆς Νεμέας , καὶ τοὺς Ἀργείους οὐκέτι κατέλαβον , ἀλλὰ καταβάντες , ὡς ἑώρων τὰ ἑαυτῶν δῃούμενα , ἐς μάχην παρετάσσοντο .
And now the Boeotians, Megareans, and Sicyonians advanced, as they had been ordered, towards Nemea, and found the Argives no longer there;


5.59.2
3791
ἀντιπαρεσκευάζοντο δὲ καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι .
but they had gone down, on seeing their property ravaged, and were forming for battle; while the Lacedaemonians also were preparing to meet them.


5.59.3
3792
ἐν μέσῳ δὲ ἀπειλημμένοι ἦσαν οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ·
Now the Argives were intercepted in the midst of their enemies;


5.59.3
3793
ἐκ μὲν γὰρ τοῦ πεδίου οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι εἶργον τῆς πόλεως καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτῶν , καθύπερθεν δὲ Κορίνθιοι καὶ Φλειάσιοι καὶ Πελληνῆς , τὸ δὲ πρὸς Νεμέας Βοιωτοὶ καὶ Σικυώνιοι καὶ Μεγαρῆς .
for on the side of the plain the Lacedaemonians and those with them excluded them from their city; above them were the Corinthians, Phliasians, and Pellenians; and in the direction of Nemea the Boeotians, Sicyonians, and Megareans.


5.59.3
3794
ἵπποι δὲ αὐτοῖς οὐ παρῆσαν ·
They had no cavalry with them;


5.59.3
3795
οὐ γάρ πω οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι μόνοι τῶν ξυμμάχων ἧκον .
for the Athenians alone of all the allies had not yet joined them.


5.59.4
3796
τὸ μὲν οὖν πλῆθος τῶν Ἀργείων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων οὐχ οὕτω δεινὸν τὸ παρὸν ἐνόμιζον , ἀλλ’ ἐν καλῷ ἐδόκει ἡ μάχη ἔσεσθαι , καὶ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἀπειληφέναι ἐν τῇ αὐτῶν τε καὶ πρὸς τῇ πόλει .
Now the mass of the Argives and their allies did not consider their present position so formidable; but fancied that the battle would be fought on favourable terms, and that they had intercepted the Lacedaemonians in their own country, and close by their city.


5.59.5
3797
τῶν δὲ Ἀργείων δύο ἄνδρες , Θράσυλός τε τῶν πέντε στρατηγῶν εἷς ὢν καὶ Ἀλκίφρων πρόξενος Λακεδαιμονίων , ἤδη τῶν στρατοπέδων ὅσον οὐ ξυνιόντων προσελθόντε Ἄγιδι διελεγέσθην μὴ ποιεῖν μάχην ·
But two individuals of the Argives, Thrasyllus, one of the five generals, and Alciphron, the proxenus of the Lacedaemonians, when the armies were now on the very point of engaging, went to Agis, and in a conference urged him not to bring on a battle;


5.59.5
3798
ἑτοίμους γὰρ εἶναι Ἀργείους δίκας δοῦναι καὶ δέξασθαι ἴσας καὶ ὁμοίας , εἴ τι ἐπικαλοῦσιν Ἀργείοις Λακεδαιμόνιοι , καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν εἰρήνην ἄγειν σπονδὰς ποιησαμένους .
since the Argives were prepared to give and accept fair and equal arbitration for whatever complaints the Lacedaemonians had against them, and to make a treaty and live in peace for the future.


5.60.1
3799
καὶ οἱ μὲν ταῦτα εἰπόντες τῶν Ἀργείων ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν καὶ οὐ τοῦ πλήθους κελεύσαντος εἶπον ·
Those of the Argives who made these statements did so on their own authority, and not by order of the people;


5.60.1
3800
καὶ ὁ Ἆγις δεξάμενος τοὺς λόγους αὐτός , καὶ οὐ μετὰ τῶν πλεόνων οὐδὲ αὐτὸς βουλευσάμενος ἀλλ’ ἢ ἑνὶ ἀνδρὶ κοινώσας τῶν ἐν τέλει ξυστρατευομένων , σπένδεται τέσσαρας μῆνας , ἐν οἷς ἔδει ἐπιτελέσαι αὐτοὺς τὰ ῥηθέντα .
and Agis on his own discretion received their proposals; and without consulting, any more than they had, with the majority, but only communicating them to one of the officers who joined the expedition, granted a truce for four months, during which they were to fulfil their agreement.


5.60.1
3801
καὶ ἀπήγαγε τὸν στρατὸν εὐθύς , οὐδενὶ φράσας τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων .
And so he immediately led back the army, without explaining the matter to any of the other confederates.


5.60.2
3802
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι εἵποντο μὲν ὡς ἡγεῖτο διὰ τὸν νόμον , ἐν αἰτίᾳ δ’ εἶχον κατ’ ἀλλήλους πολλῇ τὸν Ἆγιν , νομίζοντες ἐν καλῷ παρατυχὸν σφίσι ξυμβαλεῖν καὶ πανταχόθεν αὐτῶν ἀποκεκλῃμένων καὶ ὑπὸ ἱππέων καὶ πεζῶν οὐδὲν δράσαντες ἄξιον τῆς παρασκευῆς ἀπιέναι .
The Lacedaemonians and allies followed, indeed, as he led them, out of respect for the law; but amongst each other they blamed him exceedingly, considering that when they had had an opportunity of fighting on favourable terms, and their enemies were hemmed in on all sides, both by infantry and cavalry, they were returning without having achieved any thing worthy of their preparations.


5.60.3
3803
στρατόπεδον γὰρ δὴ τοῦτο κάλλιστον Ἑλληνικὸν τῶν μέχρι τοῦδε ξυνῆλθεν ·
For indeed this was the finest Grecian army that had ever been brought together up to that time;


5.60.3
3804
ὤφθη δὲ μάλιστα ἕως ἔτι ἦν ἁθρόον ἐν Νεμέᾳ , ἐν ᾧ Λακεδαιμόνιοί τε πανστρατιᾷ ἦσαν καὶ Ἀρκάδες καὶ Βοιωτοὶ καὶ Κορίνθιοι καὶ Σικυώνιοι καὶ Πελληνῆς καὶ Φλειάσιοι καὶ Μεγαρῆς , καὶ οὗτοι πάντες λογάδες ἀφ’ ἑκάστων , ἀξιόμαχοι δοκοῦντες εἶναι οὐ τῇ Ἀργείων μόνον ξυμμαχίᾳ ἀλλὰ κἂν ἄλλῃ ἔτι προσγενομένῃ .
and it appeared such especially while it was still all united at Nemea. Consisting of the Lacedaemonians in full force, the Arcadians, Boeotians, Corinthians, Sicyonians, Pellenians, Phliasians, and Megareans; and those, too, all picked men from their respective populations, and thinking themselves a match, not only for the Argive confederacy, but even for another such added to it.


5.60.4
3805
τὸ μὲν οὖν στρατόπεδον οὕτως ἐν αἰτίᾳ ἔχοντες τὸν Ἆγιν ἀνεχώρουν τε καὶ διελύθησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἕκαστοι , Ἀργεῖοι δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔτι ἐν πολλῷ πλέονι αἰτίᾳ εἶχον τοὺς σπεισαμένους ἄνευ τοῦ πλήθους , νομίζοντες κ- ἐκεῖνοι μὴ ἂν σφίσι ποτὲ κάλλιον παρασχὸν Λακεδαιμονίους διαπεφευγέναι ·
Thus then the army, finding great fault with Agis, withdrew, and dispersed to their several homes.


5.60.5
3806
πρός τε γὰρ τῇ σφετέρᾳ πόλει καὶ μετὰ πολλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν ξυμμάχων τὸν ἀγῶνα ἂν γίγνεσθαι .
But the Argives, on their side, blamed far more severely still those who had concluded the truce without consulting the people; as they too thought that the Lacedaemonians had escaped when they never could have had a finer opportunity of destroying them; since the contest would have been decided near their own city, and in concert with many brave allies.


5.60.6
3807
τόν τε Θράσυλον ἀναχωρήσαντες ἐν τῷ Χαράδρῳ , οὗπερ τὰς ἀπὸ στρατείας δίκας πρὶν ἐσιέναι κρίνουσιν , ἤρξαντο λεύειν .
On their return therefore they began to stone Thrasyllus in the bed of the Charadrus, where they try all causes that may arise from any expedition, before they enter the city.


5.60.6
3808
ὁ δὲ καταφυγὼν ἐπὶ τὸν βωμὸν περιγίγνεται ·
He escaped by flying for refuge to the altar;


5.60.6
3809
τὰ μέντοι χρήματα ἐδήμευσαν αὐτοῦ .
his property, however, was confiscated by them.


5.61.1
3810
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο Ἀθηναίων βοηθησάντων χιλίων ὁπλιτῶν καὶ τριακοσίων ἱππέων , ὧν ἐστρατήγουν Λάχης καὶ Νικόστρατος , οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ( ὅμως γὰρ τὰς σπονδὰς ὤκνουν λῦσαι πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ) ἀπιέναι ἐκέλευον αὐτοὺς καὶ πρὸς τὸν δῆμον οὐ προσῆγον βουλομένους χρηματίσαι , πρὶν δὴ Μαντινῆς καὶ Ἠλεῖοι ( ἔτι γὰρ παρῆσαν ) κατηνάγκασαν δεόμενοι .
After this, when the Athenian succours arrived, consisting of a thousand heavy-armed and three hundred cavalry, commanded by Laches and Nicostratus, the Argives being loath, notwithstanding their arrival, to break the truce with the Lacedaemonians, commanded them to go back, though they wished to make a communication to them, and did not grant them a public audience, until the Mantineans and Eleans, (for they were still there,) by their entreaties, constrained them to do so.


5.61.2
3811
καὶ ἔλεγον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι Ἀλκιβιάδου πρεσβευτοῦ παρόντος ἔν τε τοῖς Ἀργείοις καὶ ξυμμάχοις ταῦτα , ὅτι οὐκ ὀρθῶς αἱ σπονδαὶ ἄνευ τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων καὶ γένοιντο , καὶ νῦν ( ἐν καιρῷ γὰρ παρεῖναι σφεῖς ) ἅπτεσθαι χρῆναι τοῦ πολέμου .
The Athenians then—Alcibiades being sent as ambassador—spoke before the Argives and their allies to this effect; that it was not right for the truce even to have been made, without the consent of the other allies; and that now, since their force had come so seasonably, they ought to proceed to hostilities.


5.61.3
3812
καὶ πείσαντες ἐκ τῶν λόγων τοὺς ξυμμάχους εὐθὺς ἐχώρουν ἐπὶ Ὀρχομενὸν τὸν Ἀρκαδικὸν πάντες πλὴν Ἀργείων ·
And having persuaded the allies by their arguments, they immediately marched against Orchomenus, all but the Argives,


5.61.3
3813
οὗτοι δὲ ὅμως καὶ πεισθέντες ὑπελείποντο πρῶτον , ἔπειτα δ’ ὕστερον καὶ οὗτοι ἦλθον .
who, though persuaded to the measure, still stayed behind at first; afterwards, however, they also went.


5.61.4
3814
καὶ προσκαθεζόμενοι τὸν Ὀρχομενὸν πάντες ἐπολιόρκουν καὶ προσβολὰς ἐποιοῦντο , βουλόμενοι ἄλλως τε προσγενέσθαι σφίσι καὶ ὅμηροι ἐκ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας ἦσαν αὐτόθι ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων κείμενοι .
Thus they all sat down before Orchomenus, and besieged it, and made assaults upon it; being for other reasons desirous to get possession of it, and especially as some hostages from Arcadia were deposited there by the Lacedaemonians.


5.61.5
3815
οἱ δὲ Ὀρχομένιοι δείσαντες τήν τε τοῦ τείχους ἀσθένειαν καὶ τοῦ στρατοῦ τὸ πλῆθος καί , ὡς οὐδεὶς αὐτοῖς ἐβοήθει , μὴ προαπόλωνται , ξυνέβησαν ὥστε ξύμμαχοί τε εἶναι καὶ ὁμήρους σφῶν τε αὐτῶν δοῦναι Μαντινεῦσι καὶ οὓς κατέθεντο Λακεδαιμόνιοι παραδοῦναι .
The Orchomenians, alarmed at the weakness of their wall and the number of the hostile forces, and fearing, since no succours had arrived, that they might perish before they did, surrendered on condition of joining the confederacy, giving hostages of their own to the Mantineans, and delivering up those whom the Lacedaemonians had deposited with them.


5.62.1
3816
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἔχοντες ἤδη τὸν Ὀρχομενὸν ἐβουλεύοντο οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐφ’ ὅτι χρὴ πρῶτον ἰέναι τῶν λοιπῶν .
After this, when the allies were now in possession of Orchomenus, they consulted to which of the remaining places they should proceed first.


5.62.1
3817
καὶ Ἠλεῖοι μὲν ἐπὶ Λέπρεον ἐκέλευον , Μαντινῆς δὲ ἐπὶ Τεγέαν ·
The Eleans urged them to go against Lepreum, the Mantineans against Tegea;


5.62.1
3818
καὶ προσέθεντο οἱ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῖς Μαντινεῦσιν .
and the Argives and Athenians sided with the Mantineans.


5.62.2
3819
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἠλεῖοι ὀργισθέντες ὅτι οὐκ ἐπὶ Λέπρεον ἐψηφίσαντο ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου ·
The Eleans, being angry at their not determining to march against Lepreum, returned home;


5.62.2
3820
οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ξύμμαχοι παρεσκευάζοντο ἐν τῇ Μαντινείᾳ ὡς ἐπὶ Τεγέαν ἰόντες .
while the rest of the allies made preparations at Mantinea for proceeding against Tegea;


5.62.2
3821
καί τινες αὐτοῖς καὶ αὐτῶν τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐνεδίδοσαν τὰ πράγματα .
and a party of the Tegeans themselves in the town were ready to give up the government to them.


5.63.1
3822
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ ἐπειδὴ ἀνεχώρησαν ἐξ Ἄργους τὰς τετραμήνους σπονδὰς ποιησάμενοι , Ἆγιν ἐν μεγάλῃ αἰτίᾳ εἶχον οὐ χειρωσάμενον σφίσιν Ἄργος , παρασχὸν καλῶς ὡς οὔπω πρότερον αὐτοὶ ἐνόμιζον ·
As for the Lacedaemonians, when they had returned from Argos after concluding the four months' truce, they blamed Agis exceedingly for not having brought Argos into subjection to them, when there was so fine an opportunity as they thought had never before presented itself;


5.63.1
3823
ἁθρόους γὰρ τοσούτους ξυμμάχους καὶ τοιούτους οὐ ῥᾴδιον εἶναι λαβεῖν .
for it was no easy thing to find so many and such allies collected together.


5.63.2
3824
ἐπειδὴ δὲ καὶ περὶ Ὀρχομενοῦ ἠγγέλλετο ἑαλωκέναι , πολλῷ δὴ μᾶλλον ἐχαλέπαινον καὶ ἐβούλευον εὐθὺς ὑπ’ ὀργῆς παρὰ τὸν τρόπον τὸν ἑαυτῶν ὡς χρὴ τήν τε οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ κατασκάψαι καὶ δέκα μυριάσι δραχμῶν ζημιῶσαι .
But when tidings also came of the capture of Orchomenus, they were far more enraged, and under the influence of anger resolved immediately (contrary to their general habit) that they ought to demolish his house, and fine him ten thousand drachmas.


5.63.3
3825
ὁ δὲ παρῃτεῖτο μηδὲν τούτων δρᾶν ·
But he besought them to do none of these things;


5.63.3
3826
ἔργῳ γὰρ ἀγαθῷ ῥύσεσθαι τὰς αἰτίας στρατευσάμενος , ἢ τότε ποιεῖν αὐτοὺς ὅτι βούλονται .
for he would atone for his faults by good service when he next took the field, or they might then do to him whatever they pleased.


5.63.4
3827
οἱ δὲ τὴν μὲν ζημίαν καὶ τὴν κατασκαφὴν ἐπέσχον , νόμον δὲ ἔθεντο ἐν τῷ παρόντι , ὃς οὔπω πρότερον ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς ·
Accordingly, they abstained from the fine and the demolition of his house, but passed a law at that time which had never before existed amongst them;


5.63.4
3828
δέκα γὰρ ἄνδρας Σπαρτιατῶν προσείλοντο αὐτῷ ξυμβούλους , ἄνευ ὧν μὴ κύριον εἶναι ἀπάγειν στρατιὰν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως .
for they chose ten Spartans to act as counsellors with him, without whose consent he should have no power to lead an army out of the city.


5.64.1
3829
ἐν τούτῳ δ’ ἀφικνεῖται αὐτοῖς ἀγγελία παρὰ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ἐκ Τεγέας ὅτι , εἰ μὴ παρέσονται ἐν τάχει , ἀποστήσεται αὐτῶν Τεγέα πρὸς Ἀργείους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους καὶ ὅσον οὐκ ἀφέστηκεν .
Meanwhile intelligence reached them from their friends in Tegea, that unless they came there quickly, Tegea would go over from them to the Argives and their allies, and that it had all but done so.


5.64.2
3830
ἐνταῦθα δὴ βοήθεια τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων γίγνεται αὐτῶν τε καὶ τῶν Εἱλώτων πανδημεὶ ὀξεῖα καὶ οἵα οὔπω πρότερον .
Upon this then succour was given them by the Lacedaemonians and their helots in full force, with vigour, and in such a way as had never been done before.


5.64.3
3831
ἐχώρουν δὲ ἐς Ὀρέσθειον τῆς Μαιναλίας ·
They advanced to Orestheum, in the Maenalian territory;


5.64.3
3832
καὶ τοῖς μὲν Ἀρκάδων σφετέροις οὖσι ξυμμάχοις προεῖπον ἁθροισθεῖσιν ἰέναι κατὰ πόδας αὐτῶν ἐς Τεγέαν , αὐτοὶ δὲ μέχρι μὲν τοῦ Ὀρεσθείου πάντες ἐλθόντες , ἐκεῖθεν δὲ τὸ ἕκτον μέρος σφῶν αὐτῶν ἀποπέμψαντες ἐπ’ οἴκου , ἐν ᾧ τὸ πρεσβύτερόν τε καὶ τὸ νεώτερον ἦν , ὥστε τὰ οἴκοι φρουρεῖν , τῷ λοιπῷ στρατεύματι ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς Τεγέαν .
and commanded those of the Arcadians who were their allies to muster and march close after them to Tegea; while they themselves, after coming all of them as far as Orestheum, from that place sent back home the sixth part of their force, in which were included those who were too old or too young for foreign service, to protect their property at home, and with the remainder of their army arrived at Tegea.


5.64.3
3833
καὶ οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἀπ’ Ἀρκάδων παρῆσαν .
where their allies from Arcadia joined them not long after.


5.64.4
3834
πέμπουσι δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον καὶ Βοιωτοὺς καὶ Φωκέας καὶ Λοκρούς , βοηθεῖν κελεύοντες κατὰ τάχος ἐς Μαντίνειαν .
Boeotians, Phocians, and Locrians, with orders to reinforce them as quickly as possible at Mantinea.


5.64.4
3835
ἀλλὰ τοῖς μὲν ἐξ ὀλίγου τε ἐγίγνετο , καὶ οὐ ῥᾴδιον ἦν μὴ ἁθρόοις καὶ ἀλλήλους περιμείνασι διελθεῖν τὴν πολεμίαν ( ξυνέκλῃε γὰρ διὰ μέσου ) , ὅμως δὲ ἠπείγοντο .
But to these the notice was short, and it was not easy, except in a body, and after waiting for each other, to cross the enemy's territory; for it closed up the communication, lying just in the way of it: however, they made all haste notwithstanding.


5.64.5
3836
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ ἀναλαβόντες τοὺς παρόντας Ἀρκάδων ξυμμάχους ἐσέβαλον ἐς τὴν Μαντινικήν , καὶ στρατοπεδευσάμενοι πρὸς τῷ Ἡρακλείῳ ἐδῄουν τὴν γῆν .
The Lacedaemonians, meanwhile, taking with them their Arcadian allies who had joined them, invaded the territory of Mantinea, and having encamped near the temple of Hercules, laid waste the land.


5.65.1
3837
οἱ δ’ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ὡς εἶδον αὐτούς , καταλαβόντες χωρίον ἐρυμνὸν καὶ δυσπρόσοδον παρετάξαντο ὡς ἐς μάχην .
The Argives and their allies, on seeing them, occupied a position that was strong and difficult of access, and drew up their troops for action.


5.65.2
3838
καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι εὐθὺς αὐτοῖς ἐπῇσαν ·
The Lacedaemonians and their allies immediately advanced against them,


5.65.2
3839
καὶ μέχρι μὲν λίθου καὶ ἀκοντίου βολῆς ἐχώρησαν , ἔπειτα τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τις Ἄγιδι ἐπεβόησεν , ὁρῶν πρὸς χωρίον καρτερὸν ἰόντας σφᾶς , ὅτι διανοεῖται κακὸν κακῷ ἰᾶσθαι , δηλῶν τῆς ἐξ Ἄργους ἐπαιτίου ἀναχωρήσεως τὴν παροῦσαν ἄκαιρον προθυμίαν ἀνάληψιν βουλόμενον εἶναι .
and proceeded to within stone's throw or arrow-shot; when one of the elders called out to Agis, " that he was purposing to cure evil with evil;"  meaning that his present unseasonable eagerness was intended to be a reparation of his culpable retreat from Argos.


5.65.3
3840
ὁ δέ , εἴτε καὶ διὰ τὸ ἐπιβόημα εἴτε καὶ αὐτῷ ἄλλο τι ἢ κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ δόξαν ἐξαίφνης , πάλιν τὸ στράτευμα κατὰ τάχος πρὶν ξυμμεῖξαι ἀπῆγεν .
He then, whether in consequence of this exclamation, or because he was himself suddenly struck by some resolution different from what he had before adopted, led his army back again with all speed, before the engagement had begun;


5.65.4
3841
καὶ ἀφικόμενος πρὸς τὴν Τεγεᾶτιν τὸ ὕδωρ ἐξέτρεπεν ἐς τὴν Μαντινικήν , περὶ οὗπερ ὡς τὰ πολλὰ βλάπτοντος ὁποτέρωσε ἂν ἐσπίπτῃ Μαντινῆς καὶ Τεγεᾶται πολεμοῦσιν .
and going into the Tegean country, diverted over that of the Mantineans the water about which the Tegeans and Mantineans are continually engaged in hostilities, as it causes a general injury to whichever country it falls into.


5.65.4
3842
ἐβούλετο δὲ τοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ λόφου βοηθοῦντας ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ ὕδατος ἐκτροπήν , ἐπειδὰν πύθωνται , καταβιβάσαι τοὺς Ἀργείους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους καὶ ἐν τῷ ὁμαλῷ τὴν μάχην ποιεῖσθαι .
His object was to bring the Argives and their allies down from the hill, on their coming to resist the diversion of the water, when they heard of it, and so to fight the battle on the plain.


5.65.5
3843
καὶ ὁ μὲν τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην μείνας αὐτοῦ περὶ τὸ ὕδωρ ἐξέτρεπεν ·
Accordingly, after staying there in the neighbourhood of the water during that day, he turned it off.


5.65.5
3844
οἱ δ’ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι τὸ μὲν πρῶτον καταπλαγέντες τῇ ἐξ ὀλίγου αἰφνιδίῳ αὐτῶν ἀναχωρήσει οὐκ εἶχον ὅτι εἰκάσωσιν ·
The Argives and their allies, on the other hand, were at first amazed at his sudden retreat, when at so short a distance from them, and did not know what to conjecture.


5.65.5
3845
εἶτα ἐπειδὴ ἀναχωροῦντες ἐκεῖνοί τε ἀπέκρυψαν καὶ σφεῖς ἡσύχαζον καὶ οὐκ ἐπηκολούθουν , ἐνταῦθα τοὺς ἑαυτῶν στρατηγοὺς αὖθις ἐν αἰτίᾳ εἶχον τό τε πρότερον καλῶς ληφθέντας πρὸς Ἄργει Λακεδαιμονίους ἀφεθῆναι καὶ νῦν ὅτι ἀποδιδράσκοντας οὐδεὶς ἐπιδιώκει , ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν οἱ μὲν σῴζονται , σφεῖς δὲ προδίδονται .
Afterwards, when the enemy had withdrawn out of sight, while they themselves remained still, and did not follow them, they then began to blame their generals again; both because, on the former occasion, the Lacedaemonians, when fairly caught near Argos, had been suffered to escape; and now, when they were running away, no one pursued them; but with perfect quiet the enemy were saving themselves, while they were being betrayed.


5.65.6
3846
οἱ δὲ στρατηγοὶ ἐθορυβήθησαν μὲν τὸ παραυτίκα , ὕστερον δὲ ἀπάγουσιν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ λόφου καὶ προελθόντες ἐς τὸ ὁμαλὸν ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο ὡς ἰόντες ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους .
The generals, then, were at the moment confounded, but afterwards they led them off from the hill, and having advanced on to the plain, pitched their camp, with the intention of advancing against the enemy.


5.66.1
3847
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἵ τε Ἀργεῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ξυνετάξαντο , ὡς ἔμελλον μαχεῖσθαι , ἢν περιτύχωσιν ·
The next day the Argives and their allies formed their line as they intended to engage, should they fall in with their opponents;


5.66.1
3848
οἵ τε Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος πρὸς τὸ Ἡράκλειον πάλιν ἐς τὸ αὐτὸ στρατόπεδον ἰόντες ὁρῶσι δι’ ὀλίγου τοὺς ἐναντίους ἐν τάξει τε ἤδη πάντας καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ λόφου προεληλυθότας .
and the Lacedaemonians, on going back again from the water to the temple of Hercules, into their old encampment, see the enemy at a short distance from them, all by this time in order of battle, and advanced from the hill.


5.66.2
3849
μάλιστα δὴ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐς ὃ ἐμέμνηντο ἐν τούτῳ τῷ καιρῷ ἐξεπλάγησαν .
The Lacedaemonians, then, were on this occasion in the greatest consternation they had ever experienced within their memory.


5.66.2
3850
διὰ βραχείας γὰρ μελλήσεως ἡ παρασκευὴ αὐτοῖς ἐγίγνετο , καὶ εὐθὺς ὑπὸ σπουδῆς καθίσταντο ἐς κόσμον τὸν ἑαυτῶν , Ἄγιδος τοῦ βασιλέως ἕκαστα ἐξηγουμένου κατὰ τὸν νόμον .
For their preparations had to be made on a short notice; and immediately they fell into their ranks in a hurry, Agis, their king, giving all orders, according to their law.


5.66.3
3851
βασιλέως γὰρ ἄγοντος ὑπ’ ἐκείνου πάντα ἄρχεται , καὶ τοῖς μὲν πολεμάρχοις αὐτὸς φράζει τὸ δέον , οἱ δὲ τοῖς λοχαγοῖς , ἐκεῖνοι δὲ τοῖς πεντηκοντῆρσιν , αὖθις δ’ οὗτοι τοῖς ἐνωμοτάρχοις καὶ οὗτοι τῇ ἐνωμοτίᾳ .
For when a king is at the head of an army, all commands are given by him; and he communicates to the  what is to be done, they to the  those to the  these again to the  and these to their


5.66.4
3852
καὶ αἱ παραγγέλσεις , ἤν τι βούλωνται , κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ χωροῦσι καὶ ταχεῖαι ἐπέρχονται ·
and thus their orders, whatever they wish to be done, pass in the same manner, and quickly reach the troops;


5.66.4
3853
σχεδὸν γάρ τι πᾶν πλὴν ὀλίγου τὸ στρατόπεδον τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἄρχοντες ἀρχόντων εἰσί , καὶ τὸ ἐπιμελὲς τοῦ δρωμένου πολλοῖς προσήκει .
for pretty nearly all the army of the Lacedaemonians, a small portion excepted, are officers over officers; and to attend to what is going on is a duty incumbent on many.


5.67.1
3854
τότε δὲ κέρας μὲν εὐώνυμον Σκιρῖται αὐτοῖς καθίσταντο , αἰεὶ ταύτην τὴν τάξιν μόνοι Λακεδαιμονίων ἐπὶ σφῶν αὐτῶν ἔχοντες ·
On that occasion the Sciritae formed their left wing; who alone of the Lacedaemonians have always that post by themselves.


5.67.1
3855
παρὰ δ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ ἀπὸ Θρᾴκης Βρασίδειοι στρατιῶται καὶ νεοδαμώδεις μετ’ αὐτῶν ·
Next to them were the soldiers who had served with Brasidas in Thrace, and the Neodamodes with them.


5.67.1
3856
ἔπειτ’ ἤδη Λακεδαιμόνιοι αὐτοὶ ἑξῆς καθίστασαν τοὺς λόχους , καὶ παρ’ αὐτοὺς Ἀρκάδων Ἡραιῆς , μετὰ δὲ τούτους Μαινάλιοι , καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ δεξιῷ κέρᾳ Τεγεᾶται καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων ὀλίγοι τὸ ἔσχατον ἔχοντες , καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς αὐτῶν ἐφ’ ἑκατέρῳ τῷ κέρᾳ .
Then came the Lacedaemonians themselves, with their  posted one after the other; by their side the Arcadians of Heraea; after them the Maenalians; and on the right wing the Tegeans, with a few of the Lacedaemonians holding the extreme position. Their cavalry was posted on each wing.


5.67.2
3857
Λακεδαιμόνιοι μὲν οὕτως ἐτάξαντο ·
The Lacedaemonians, then, were drawn up in this way.


5.67.2
3858
οἱ δ’ ἐναντίοι αὐτοῖς δεξιὸν μὲν κέρας Μαντινῆς εἶχον , ὅτι ἐν τῇ ἐκείνων τὸ ἔργον ἐγίγνετο , παρὰ δ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ ξύμμαχοι Ἀρκάδων ἦσαν , ἔπειτα Ἀργείων οἱ χίλιοι λογάδες , οἷς ἡ πόλις ἐκ πολλοῦ ἄσκησιν τῶν ἐς τὸν πόλεμον δημοσίᾳ παρεῖχε , καὶ ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν οἱ ἄλλοι Ἀργεῖοι , καὶ μετ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ ξύμμαχοι αὐτῶν , Κλεωναῖοι καὶ Ὀρνεᾶται , ἔπειτα Ἀθηναῖοι ἔσχατοι τὸ εὐώνυμον κέρας ἔχοντες , καὶ ἱππῆς μετ’ αὐτῶν οἱ οἰκεῖοι .
On the side of their opponents, their right wing was occupied by the Mantineans, because the action was to be fought in their country; and by their side were the Arcadian allies. Then came the thousand picked men of the Argives, for whom the state had for a long time furnished at the public expense a course of training in military matters; next to them the other Argives; and after these, their allies the Cleonaeans and Orneans; then the Athenians, holding the extreme left, and their own cavalry with them.


5.68.1
3859
τάξις μὲν ἥδε καὶ παρασκευὴ ἀμφοτέρων ἦν , τὸ δὲ στρατόπεδον τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων μεῖζον ἐφάνη .
Such was the order of battle and the preparation on both sides. The army of the Lacedaemonians appeared the larger of the two;


5.68.2
3860
ἀριθμὸν δὲ γράψαι ἢ καθ’ ἑκάστους ἑκατέρων ἢ ξύμπαντας οὐκ ἂν ἐδυνάμην ἀκριβῶς ·
For the number of the Lacedaemonians, on account of the secrecy of their government, was not known;


5.68.2
3861
τὸ μὲν γὰρ Λακεδαιμονίων πλῆθος διὰ τῆς πολιτείας τὸ κρυπτὸν ἠγνοεῖτο , τῶν δ’ αὖ διὰ τὸ ἀνθρώπειον κομπῶδες ἐς τὰ οἰκεῖα πλήθη ἠπιστεῖτο .
and that of the others, in consequence of men's natural tendency to boasting with regard to their own numbers, was regarded with distrust.


5.68.2
3862
ἐκ μέντοι τοιοῦδε λογισμοῦ ἔξεστί τῳ σκοπεῖν τὸ Λακεδαιμονίων τότε παραγενόμενον πλῆθος .
From the following mode of calculating, however, one may see the number of Lacedaemonians that was present on that occasion.


5.68.3
3863
λόχοι μὲν γὰρ ἐμάχοντο ἑπτὰ ἄνευ Σκιριτῶν ὄντων ἑξακοσίων , ἐν δὲ ἑκάστῳ λόχῳ πεντηκοστύες ἦσαν τέσσαρες , καὶ ἐν τῇ πεντηκοστύι ἐνωμοτίαι τέσσαρες .
There were engaged in the battle seven  exclusive of the Sciritae, who amounted to six hundred; and in each  there were four  and in the  four


5.68.3
3864
τῆς τε ἐνωμοτίας ἐμάχοντο ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ ζυγῷ τέσσαρες ·
In the first rank of the  there were four fighting men.


5.68.3
3865
ἐπὶ δὲ βάθος ἐτάξαντο μὲν οὐ πάντες ὁμοίως , ἀλλ’ ὡς λοχαγὸς ἕκαστος ἐβούλετο , ἐπὶ πᾶν δὲ κατέστησαν ἐπὶ ὀκτώ .
In depth, though they had not all been drawn up alike, but as each  chose, they took their position on the field uniformly eight deep.


5.68.3
3866
παρὰ δὲ ἅπαν πλὴν Σκιριτῶν τετρακόσιοι καὶ δυοῖν δέοντες πεντήκοντα ἄνδρες ἡ πρώτη τάξις ἦν .
And thus, along the whole line, the first rank consisted of four hundred and forty-eight men, besides the Sciritae.


5.69.1
3867
ἐπεὶ δὲ ξυνιέναι ἔμελλον ἤδη , ἐνταῦθα καὶ παραινέσεις καθ’ ἑκάστους ὑπὸ τῶν οἰκείων στρατηγῶν τοιαίδε ἐγίγνοντο , Μαντινεῦσι μὲν ὅτι ὑπέρ τε πατρίδος ἡ μάχη ἔσται καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀρχῆς ἅμα καὶ δουλείας , τὴν μὲν μὴ πειρασαμένοις ἀφαιρεθῆναι , τῆς δὲ μὴ αὖθις πειρᾶσθαι ·
When they were now on the point of engaging, the following admonitions were then severally addressed to them by their own generals. To the Mantineans, that the battle would be fought for their country, and to decide on the question of empire and slavery-that they might not be deprived of the former after tasting it, and might avoid again tasting the latter.


5.69.1
3868
Ἀργείοις δὲ ὑπὲρ τῆς τε παλαιᾶς ἡγεμονίας καὶ τῆς ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ ποτὲ ἰσομοιρίας μὴ διὰ παντὸς στερισκομένους ἀνέχεσθαι , καὶ ἄνδρας ἅμα ἐχθροὺς καὶ ἀστυγείτονας ὑπὲρ πολλῶν ἀδικημάτων ἀμύνασθαι ·
To the Argives, that they would fight for their original supremacy, and not to brook being for ever deprived of their former equal share of the Peloponnese; and at the same time to avenge themselves on men who were their enemies, and near ones too, for many acts of injustice.


5.69.1
3869
τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις καλὸν εἶναι μετὰ πολλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν ξυμμάχων ἀγωνιζομένους μηδενὸς λείπεσθαι , καὶ ὅτι ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ Λακεδαιμονίους νικήσαντες τήν τε ἀρχὴν βεβαιοτέραν καὶ μείζω ἕξουσι καὶ οὐ μή ποτέ τις αὐτοῖς ἄλλος ἐς τὴν γῆν ἔλθῃ .
To the Athenians, that fighting as they were in concert with many brave allies, it was a glorious thing for them to show themselves inferior to none; and that by defeating the Lacedaemonians in the Peloponnese, they would enjoy their empire more securely, and to a greater extent, while no one else would ever march against their country.


5.69.2
3870
τοῖς μὲν Ἀργείοις καὶ ξυμμάχοις τοιαῦτα παρῃνέθη , Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ καθ’ ἑκάστους τε καὶ μετὰ τῶν πολεμικῶν νόμων ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ὧν ἠπίσταντο τὴν παρακέλευσιν τῆς μνήμης ἀγαθοῖς οὖσιν ἐποιοῦντο , εἰδότες ἔργων ἐκ πολλοῦ μελέτην πλείω σῴζουσαν ἢ λόγων δι’ ὀλίγου καλῶς ῥηθεῖσαν παραίνεσιν .
To the Argives and their allies such were the admonitions that were addressed. The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, both individually amongst themselves, and with their national war-songs, exhorted one another, as brave men, to remember what they had learned before; knowing that actual training for a long time previous was of more benefit than a brief verbal exhortation, however well expressed.


5.70.1
3871
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἡ ξύνοδος ἦν , Ἀργεῖοι μὲν καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐντόνως καὶ ὀργῇ χωροῦντες , Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ βραδέως καὶ ὑπὸ αὐλητῶν πολλῶν ὁμοῦ ἐγκαθεστώτων , οὐ τοῦ θείου χάριν , ἀλλ’ ἵνα ὁμαλῶς μετὰ ῥυθμοῦ βαίνοντες προσέλθοιεν καὶ μὴ διασπασθείη αὐτοῖς ἡ τάξις , ὅπερ φιλεῖ τὰ μεγάλα στρατόπεδα ἐν ταῖς προσόδοις ποιεῖν .
After this the conflict commenced: the Argives and their allies advancing with haste and impetuosity; the Lacedaemonians slowly, and to the music of many flute-players, placed amongst them according to custom, not with a religious object, but that they might advance evenly, stepping in time, and so that their line might not be broken, a thing which large armies are apt to do in their approaches to an enemy.


5.71.1
3872
ξυνιόντων δ’ ἔτι Ἆγις ὁ βασιλεὺς τοιόνδε ἐβουλεύσατο δρᾶσαι .
While they were yet closing in battle, King Agis resolved to execute a manoeuvre, as follows.


5.71.1
3873
τὰ στρατόπεδα ποιεῖ μὲν καὶ ἅπαντα τοῦτο ·
All armies, on going into battle, are forced out too much on their right wing;


5.71.1
3874
ἐπὶ τὰ δεξιὰ κέρατα αὐτῶν ἐν ταῖς ξυνόδοις μᾶλλον ἐξωθεῖται , καὶ περιίσχουσι κατὰ τὸ τῶν ἐναντίων εὐώνυμον ἀμφότεροι τῷ δεξιῷ , διὰ τὸ φοβουμένους προσστέλλειν τὰ γυμνὰ ἕκαστον ὡς μάλιστα τῇ τοῦ ἐν δεξιᾷ παρατεταγμένου ἀσπίδι καὶ νομίζειν τὴν πυκνότητα τῆς ξυγκλῄσεως εὐσκεπαστότατον εἶναι ·
because the men, in their fear, each shelter, as far as possible, their exposed side with the shield of the man who is posted next to them on the right, and think that the closer they are locked together, the more effectually they are protected.


5.71.1
3875
καὶ ἡγεῖται μὲν τῆς αἰτίας ταύτης ὁ πρωτοστάτης τοῦ δεξιοῦ κέρως , προθυμούμενος ἐξαλλάσσειν αἰεὶ τῶν ἐναντίων τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γύμνωσιν , ἕπονται δὲ διὰ τὸν αὐτὸν φόβον καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι .
The man who primarily gives occasion to this is he who stands first on the right wing, through wishing continually to withdraw from the enemy his own unarmed side; and the rest follow him under the influence of the same fear.


5.71.2
3876
καὶ τότε περιέσχον μὲν οἱ Μαντινῆς πολὺ τῷ κέρᾳ τῶν Σκιριτῶν , ἔτι δὲ πλέον οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ Τεγεᾶται τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὅσῳ μεῖζον τὸ στράτευμα εἶχον .
And so, on that occasion, the Mantineans reached with their wing far beyond the Sciritae, and the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans farther still beyond the Athenians, inasmuch as their army was larger than theirs.


5.71.3
3877
δείσας δὲ Ἆγις μὴ σφῶν κυκλωθῇ τὸ εὐώνυμον , καὶ νομίσας ἄγαν περιέχειν τοὺς Μαντινέας , τοῖς μὲν Σκιρίταις καὶ Βρασιδείοις ἐσήμηνεν ἐπεξαγαγόντας ἀπὸ σφῶν ἐξισῶσαι τοῖς Μαντινεῦσιν , ἐς δὲ τὸ διάκενον τοῦτο παρήγγελλεν ἀπὸ τοῦ δεξιοῦ κέρως δύο λόχους τῶν πολεμάρχων Ἱππονοΐδᾳ καὶ Ἀριστοκλεῖ ἔχουσι παρελθεῖν καὶ ἐσβαλόντας πληρῶσαι , νομίζων τῷ θ’ ἑαυτῶν δεξιῷ ἔτι περιουσίαν ἔσεσθαι καὶ τὸ κατὰ τοὺς Μαντινέας βεβαιότερον τετάξεσθαι .
Agis therefore, being afraid that their left might be surrounded, and thinking that the Mantineans were extending too far beyond it, gave orders for the Sciritae and Brasidean soldiers to advance from their position with a part of their number, and equalize their line to that of the Mantineans; while into the void thus created he ordered Hipponoidas and Aristocles, two of the polemarchs, to move over from the right wing with their  and by throwing themselves into it to fill it up; thinking that their own right would still have an abundance of strength, and that the line opposite the Mantineans would be formed the more firmly.


5.72.1
3878
ξυνέβη οὖν αὐτῷ ἅτε ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἐφόδῳ καὶ ἐξ ὀλίγου παραγγείλαντι τόν τε Ἀριστοκλέα καὶ τὸν Ἱππονοΐδαν μὴ ’θελῆσαι παρελθεῖν , ἀλλὰ καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τὸ αἰτίαμα ὕστερον φεύγειν ἐκ Σπάρτης δόξαντας μαλακισθῆναι , καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους φθάσαι τῇ προσμείξει , καὶ κελεύσαντος αὐτοῦ , ἐπὶ τοὺς Σκιρίτας ὡς οὐ παρῆλθον οἱ λόχοι , πάλιν αὖ σφίσι προσμεῖξαι , μὴ δυνηθῆναι ἔτι μηδὲ τούτους ξυγκλῇσαι .
Now as he gave these orders at the very moment of the charge, and on a sudden, the consequence was, that Aristocles and Hipponoidas would not move on, (they were for this offence afterwards banished from Sparta, being thought to have shown cowardice,) and that so the enemy closed with them before any thing could be done; and moreover, that when he ordered the Sciritae to rejoin their comrades, since the  did not move on to their support, neither could these now fill up the line.


5.72.2
3879
ἀλλὰ μάλιστα δὴ κατὰ πάντα τῇ ἐμπειρίᾳ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐλασσωθέντες τότε τῇ ἀνδρείᾳ ἔδειξαν οὐχ ἧσσον περιγενόμενοι .
But when the Lacedaemonians were most decidedly and in every respect beaten in point of skill, at that very time they proved themselves no less superior in point of courage.


5.72.3
3880
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἐν χερσὶν ἐγίγνοντο τοῖς ἐναντίοις , τὸ μὲν τῶν Μαντινέων δεξιὸν τρέπει αὐτῶν τοὺς Σκιρίτας καὶ τοὺς Βρασιδείους , καὶ ἐσπεσόντες οἱ Μαντινῆς καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν Ἀργείων οἱ χίλιοι λογάδες κατὰ τὸ διάκενον καὶ οὐ ξυγκλῃσθὲν τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους διέφθειρον καὶ κυκλωσάμενοι ἔτρεψαν καὶ ἐξέωσαν ἐς τὰς ἁμάξας καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τῶν ἐπιτεταγμένων ἀπέκτεινάν τινας .
For when they had come to close quarters with their opponents, though the right wing of the Mantineans broke their Sciritan and Brasidean corps, and the Mantineans and their allies, with the thousand picked men of the Argives, rushing in through the open and unclosed part of the line, cut up the Lacedaemonians, having surrounded and broken them, and drove them to the baggage waggons, and killed some of the veterans who were posted as a guard over them:


5.72.4
3881
καὶ ταύτῃ μὲν ἡσσῶντο οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ·
though in this part of the field, I say, the Lacedaemonians were worsted,


5.72.4
3882
τῷ δὲ ἄλλῳ στρατοπέδῳ καὶ μάλιστα τῷ μέσῳ , ᾗπερ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἆγις ἦν καὶ περὶ αὐτὸν οἱ τριακόσιοι ἱππῆς καλούμενοι , προσπεσόντες τῶν τε Ἀργείων τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις καὶ πέντε λόχοις ὠνομασμένοις καὶ Κλεωναίοις καὶ Ὀρνεάταις καὶ Ἀθηναίων τοῖς παρατεταγμένοις , ἔτρεψαν οὐδὲ ἐς χεῖρας τοὺς πολλοὺς ὑπομείναντας , ἀλλ’ ὡς ἐπῇσαν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι εὐθὺς ἐνδόντας καὶ ἔστιν οὓς καὶ καταπατηθέντας τοῦ μὴ φθῆναι τὴν ἐγκατάληψιν .
yet with the rest of their forces, and especially the centre, where was King Agis, and around him the three hundred horsemen, as they are called, they fell on the veterans of the Argives, and are named the five  with the Cleonaeans, the Orneans, and those of the Athenians who were posted next to them, and put them to flight; the majority not having even waited to close with them, but having, on the approach of the Lacedaemonians, immediately given way, and some of them having been even trodden under foot, in their hurry to avoid being anticipated and overtaken.


5.73.1
3883
ὡς δὲ ταύτῃ ἐνεδεδώκει τὸ τῶν Ἀργείων καὶ ξυμμάχων στράτευμα , παρερρήγνυντο ἤδη ἅμα καὶ ἐφ’ ἑκάτερα , καὶ ἅμα τὸ δεξιὸν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Τεγεατῶν ἐκυκλοῦτο τῷ περιέχοντι σφῶν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , καὶ ἀμφοτέρωθεν αὐτοὺς κίνδυνος περιειστήκει , τῇ μὲν κυκλουμένους , τῇ δὲ ἤδη ἡσσημένους .
When the army of the Argives and their allies had given way on this side, their line was now broken off both ways; while at the same time the right wing of the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans was surrounding the Athenians with the troops which outflanked them, and they were encompassed with danger on both sides, as they were being surrounded on one, and were already beaten on the other.


5.73.1
3884
καὶ μάλιστ’ ἂν τοῦ στρατεύματος ἐταλαιπώρησαν , εἰ μὴ οἱ ἱππῆς παρόντες αὐτοῖς ὠφέλιμοι ἦσαν .
Indeed they would have suffered most severely of all the army, if the presence of their cavalry had not been of service to them.


5.73.2
3885
καὶ ξυνέβη τὸν Ἆγιν , ὡς ᾔσθετο τὸ εὐώνυμον σφῶν πονοῦν τὸ κατὰ τοὺς Μαντινέας καὶ τῶν Ἀργείων τοὺς χιλίους , παραγγεῖλαι παντὶ τῷ στρατεύματι χωρῆσαι ἐπὶ τὸ νικώμενον .
It happened too, that Agis, on perceiving the Lacedaemonian left wing, which was opposed to the Montineans and the thousand Argives, to be hard pressed, gave orders for the whole army to advance to the support of the division which was being defeated.


5.73.3
3886
καὶ γενομένου τούτου οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν τούτῳ , ὡς παρῆλθε καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἀπὸ σφῶν τὸ στράτευμα , καθ’ ἡσυχίαν ἐσώθησαν καὶ τῶν Ἀργείων μετ’ αὐτῶν τὸ ἡσσηθέν ·
And when this was done, the Athenians meanwhile, as the enemy's forces passed on and withdrew from them, escaped at their leisure, and with them the beaten division of the Argives.


5.73.3
3887
οἱ δὲ Μαντινῆς καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι καὶ τῶν Ἀργείων οἱ λογάδες οὐκέτι πρὸς τὸ ἐγκεῖσθαι τοῖς ἐναντίοις τὴν γνώμην εἶχον , ἀλλ’ ὁρῶντες τούς τε σφετέρους νενικημένους καὶ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἐπιφερομένους ἐς φυγὴν ἐτράποντο .
The Mantineans and their allies, on the other hand, and the picked men of the Argives, were no longer disposed to press on their adversaries; but seeing their own side defeated, and the Lacedaemonians advancing against them, they took to flight.


5.73.4
3888
καὶ τῶν μὲν Μαντινέων καὶ πλείους διεφθάρησαν , τῶν δὲ Ἀργείων λογάδων τὸ πολὺ ἐσώθη .
And of the Mantineans many were slain, but of the picked Argives the great majority escaped.


5.73.4
3889
ἡ μέντοι φυγὴ καὶ ἀποχώρησις οὐ βίαιος οὐδὲ μακρὰ ἦν ·
However, the flight and retreat were not hard pressed, nor to any great distance;


5.73.4
3890
οἱ γὰρ Λακεδαιμόνιοι μέχρι μὲν τοῦ τρέψαι χρονίους τὰς μάχας καὶ βεβαίους τῷ μένειν ποιοῦνται , τρέψαντες δὲ βραχείας καὶ οὐκ ἐπὶ πολὺ τὰς διώξεις .
for though the Lacedaemonians, until they have routed their enemies, fight for a long time, and stubbornly, as regards standing their ground; yet when they have routed them, they pursue but for a short time and for a little distance.


5.74.1
3891
καὶ ἡ μὲν μάχη τοιαύτη καὶ ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τούτων ἐγένετο , πλείστου δὴ χρόνου μεγίστη δὴ τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν καὶ ὑπὸ ἀξιολογωτάτων πόλεων ξυνελθοῦσα .
Of such a character then, and answering as nearly as possible to this description, was the battle—the greatest that had occurred for a very long time amongst the Greeks, and fought by the most considerable states.


5.74.2
3892
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι προθέμενοι τῶν πολεμίων νεκρῶν τὰ ὅπλα τροπαῖον εὐθὺς ἵστασαν καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ἐσκύλευον , καὶ τοὺς αὑτῶν ἀνείλοντο καὶ ἀπήγαγον ἐς Τεγέαν , οὗπερ ἐτάφησαν , καὶ τοὺς τῶν πολεμίων ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν .
The Lacedaemonians, after piling their arms in front of the enemy's dead, immediately erected a trophy, and stripped the slain; and taking up their own dead carried them back to Tegea, where they were buried, while they restored the enemy's under truce.


5.74.3
3893
ἀπέθανον δὲ Ἀργείων μὲν καὶ Ὀρνεατῶν καὶ Κλεωναίων ἑπτακόσιοι , Μαντινέων δὲ διακόσιοι , καὶ Ἀθηναίων ξὺν Αἰγινήταις διακόσιοι καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἀμφότεροι .
There were killed, of the Argives, Orneans, and Cleonaeans, seven hundred;


5.74.3
3894
Λακεδαιμονίων δὲ οἱ μὲν ξύμμαχοι οὐκ ἐταλαιπώρησαν ὥστε καὶ ἀξιόλογόν τι ἀπογενέσθαι ·
of the Mantineans, two hundred; and the same number of the Athenians including the Aeginetans, with their generals.


5.74.3
3895
αὐτῶν δὲ χαλεπὸν μὲν ἦν τὴν ἀλήθειαν πυθέσθαι , ἐλέγοντο δὲ περὶ τριακοσίους ἀποθανεῖν .
On the side of the Lacedaemonians, the allies did not suffer to such an extent that any number worth mentioning were killed; and of themselves it was difficult to learn the truth, but about three hundred were said to have fallen.


5.75.1
3896
τῆς δὲ μάχης μελλούσης ἔσεσθαι καὶ Πλειστοάναξ ὁ ἕτερος βασιλεὺς ἔχων τούς τε πρεσβυτέρους καὶ νεωτέρους ἐβοήθησε , καὶ μέχρι μὲν Τεγέας ἀφίκετο , πυθόμενος δὲ τὴν νίκην ἀπεχώρησεν .
Now when the engagement was about to take place, Pleistoanax also, the other king, set out to their aid with those who were above and below the usual age for service, and reached as far as Tegea, but went back again on hearing of the victory.


5.75.2
3897
καὶ τοὺς ἀπὸ Κορίνθου καὶ ἔξω Ἰσθμοῦ ξυμμάχους ἀπέστρεψαν πέμψαντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀναχωρήσαντες καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀφέντες ( Κάρνεια γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἐτύγχανον ὄντα ) τὴν ἑορτὴν ἦγον .
The Lacedaemonians sent, too, and turned back the allies from Corinth and from beyond the Isthmus; and having themselves returned and dismissed their allies, they kept the festival; (for it happened to be the time of their Carnea).


5.75.3
3898
καὶ τὴν ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων τότε ἐπιφερομένην αἰτίαν ἔς τε μαλακίαν διὰ τὴν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ξυμφορὰν καὶ ἐς τὴν ἄλλην ἀβουλίαν τε καὶ βραδυτῆτα ἑνὶ ἔργῳ τούτῳ ἀπελύσαντο , τύχῃ μέν , ὡς ἐδόκουν , κακιζόμενοι , γνώμῃ δὲ οἱ αὐτοὶ ἔτι ὄντες .
And the imputations which at that time were urged against them by the Greeks, both on the score of cowardice in consequence of their disaster in the island, and of their bad management and dilatoriness in other respects, they wiped out by this one action; having been, as was now thought, reduced by fortune, but still the same men at heart.


5.75.4
3899
τῇ δὲ προτέρᾳ ἡμέρᾳ ξυνέβη τῆς μάχης ταύτης καὶ τοὺς Ἐπιδαυρίους πανδημεὶ ἐσβαλεῖν ἐς τὴν Ἀργείαν ὡς ἐρῆμον οὖσαν καὶ τοὺς ὑπολοίπους φύλακας τῶν Ἀργείων ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν διαφθεῖραι πολλούς .
Now the day before this battle it also happened that the Epidaurians with all their forces invaded the Argive territory, and cut off in great numbers, when they came out to give them battle, those of the Argives who were left behind to keep


5.75.5
3900
καὶ Ἠλείων τρισχιλίων ὁπλιτῶν βοηθησάντων Μαντινεῦσιν ὕστερον τῆς μάχης καὶ Ἀθηναίων χιλίων πρὸς τοῖς προτέροις ἐστράτευσαν ἅπαντες οἱ ξύμμαχοι οὗτοι εὐθὺς ἐπὶ Ἐπίδαυρον , ἕως οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι Κάρνεια ἦγον , καὶ διελόμενοι τὴν πόλιν περιετείχιζον .
guard. Moreover, when three thousand of the Elean heavy-armed had come after the battle to the succour of the Mantineans, and a thousand Athenians in addition to their former force, all these allies at once marched against Epidaurus, while the Lacedaemonians were keeping the Carnea; and dividing the work between them, they began a wall of circumvallation round the


5.75.6
3901
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι ἐξεπαύσαντο , Ἀθηναῖοι δέ , ὥσπερ προσετάχθησαν , τὴν ἄκραν τὸ Ἡραῖον εὐθὺς ἐξειργάσαντο .
city. And though the rest abandoned the work, the Athenians finished it round the promontory called the Heraeum, the part which had been assigned to them.


5.75.6
3902
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ξυγκαταλιπόντες ἅπαντες τῷ τειχίσματι φρουρὰν ἀνεχώρησαν κατὰ πόλεις ἕκαστοι .
And having all joined in leaving a garrison in this fortress, they returned to their several cities.


5.75.6
3903
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And so the summer ended.


5.76.1
3904
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος ἀρχομένου εὐθὺς οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ἐπειδὴ τὰ Κάρνεια ἤγαγον , ἐξεστράτευσαν , καὶ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Τεγέαν λόγους προύπεμπον ἐς τὸ Ἄργος ξυμβατηρίους .
At the beginning of the following winter, the Lacedaemonians, after they had celebrated the Carnean festival, immediately took the field; and on arriving at Tegea, sent on to Argos proposals for an accommodation.


5.76.2
3905
ἦσαν δὲ αὐτοῖς πρότερόν τε ἄνδρες ἐπιτήδειοι καὶ βουλόμενοι τὸν δῆμον τὸν ἐν Ἄργει καταλῦσαι ·
For there had been there previously a party in their interest, and desirous of putting down the democracy at Argos;


5.76.2
3906
καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἡ μάχη ἐγεγένητο , πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐδύναντο πείθειν τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐς τὴν ὁμολογίαν .
and since the battle had been fought, they were much better able to persuade the people at large to the proposed arrangement.


5.76.2
3907
ἐβούλοντο δὲ πρῶτον σπονδὰς ποιήσαντες πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους αὖθις ὕστερον καὶ ξυμμαχίαν , καὶ οὕτως ἤδη τῷ δήμῳ ἐπιτίθεσθαι .
Their wish was, after first concluding a treaty with the Lacedaemonians, then, in the second place, to enter into alliance with them; and so at length to attack the democracy.


5.76.3
3908
καὶ ἀφικνεῖται πρόξενος ὢν Ἀργείων Λίχας ὁ Ἀρκεσιλάου παρὰ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων δύο λόγω φέρων ἐς τὸ Ἄργος , τὸν μὲν καθ’ ὅτι εἰ βούλονται πολεμεῖν , τὸν δ’ ὡς εἰ εἰρήνην ἄγειν .
Accordingly, there came from the Lacedaemonians to Argos, Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, who was  for the Argives, bearing two proposals, one as to the mode in which they should carry on hostilities, if they preferred it; the other, as to the footing on which they should remain at peace, if they preferred that.


5.76.3
3909
καὶ γενομένης πολλῆς ἀντιλογίας ( ἔτυχε γὰρ καὶ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης παρών ) οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις πράσσοντες , ἤδη καὶ ἐκ τοῦ φανεροῦ τολμῶντες , ἔπεισαν τοὺς Ἀργείους προσδέξασθαι τὸν ξυμβατήριον λόγον .
And after there had been much controversy on the subject, (for Alcibiades also happened to be present,) the party who negotiated for the Lacedaemonians, and who now ventured to do so openly, prevailed on the Argives to accept the proposal for an accommodation;


5.76.3
3910
ἔστι δὲ ὅδε .
which was to this effect:


5.77.1
3911
&quot; καττάδε δοκεῖ τᾷ ἐκκλησίᾳ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ξυμβαλέσθαι ποττὼς Ἀργείως , ἀποδιδόντας τὼς παῖδας τοῖς Ὀρχομενίοις καὶ τὼς ἄνδρας τοῖς Μαιναλίοις , καὶ τὼς ἄνδρας τὼς ἐν Μαντινείᾳ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἀποδιδόντας , καὶ ἐξ Ἐπιδαύρω ἐκβῶντας καὶ τὸ τεῖχος ἀναιρίοντας .
" It seems good to the assembly of the Lacedaemonians to enter into agreement with the Argives on the following conditions:—That they shall restore their children to the Orchomenians, their men to the Maenalians, and the men deposited at Mantinea to the Lacedaemonians. That they shall evacuate Epidaurus, and demolish their fortification there:"


5.77.2
3912
αἰ δέ κα μὴ εἴκωντι τοὶ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐξ Ἐπιδαύρω , πολεμίως ἦμεν τοῖς Ἀργείοις καὶ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ξυμμάχοις καὶ τοῖς τῶν Ἀργείων ξυμμάχοις .
" and that if the Athenians do not withdraw from Epidaurus, they shall be declared enemies to the Argives and Lacedaemonians, with the allies of both those states.—"


5.77.3
3913
καὶ αἴ τινα τοὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι παῖδα ἔχοντι , ἀποδόμεν ταῖς πολίεσσι πάσαις .
" That if the Lacedaemonians have any children in their custody, they shall restore them to all the states.—"


5.77.4
3914
περὶ δὲ τῶ σιῶ σύματος , αἰ μὲν λῆν , τοῖς Ἐπιδαυρίοις ὅρκον δόμεν , αἰ δέ , αὐτὼς ὀμόσαι .
" That with respect to the offering to the god, the Epidaurians shall be at liberty to take an oath on the subject, and that the Argives shall allow them to do so.—"


5.77.5
3915
τὰς δὲ πόλιας τὰς ἐν Πελοποννάσῳ , καὶ μικρὰς καὶ μεγάλας , αὐτονόμως ἦμεν πάσας καττὰ πάτρια .
" That the states in the Peloponnese, both small and great, shall be all independent, according to the institutions of their fathers.—"


5.77.6
3916
αἰ δέ κα τῶν ἐκτὸς Πελοποννάσω τις ἐπὶ τὰν Πελοπόννασον γᾶν ἴῃ ἐπὶ κακῷ , ἀλεξέμεναι ἁμόθι βωλευσαμένως , ὅπᾳ κα δικαιότατα δοκῇ τοῖς Πελοποννασίοις .
" That if any of those beyond the Peloponnese come against the Peloponnesian territory with evil intent, they shall repel the invader by common counsel, on such terms as shall seem most just for the Peloponnesians.—"


5.77.7
3917
ὅσσοι δ’ ἐκτὸς Πελοποννάσω τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ξύμμαχοί ἐντι , ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ἐσσίονται ἐν τῷπερ καὶ τοὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , καὶ τοὶ τῶν Ἀργείων ξύμμαχοι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ἐσσίονται ἐν τῷπερ καὶ τοὶ Ἀργεῖοι , τὰν αὐτῶν ἔχοντες .
" That whatever people out of the Peloponnese are allies of the Lacedaemonians, they shall stand on the same footing as the allies of the Lacedaemonians and of the Argives, retaining their own possessions.—"


5.77.8
3918
ἐπιδείξαντας δὲ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις ξυμβαλέσθαι , αἴ κα αὐτοῖς δοκῇ .
" That the contracting parties shall show these conditions to the allies, and enter into agreement with them, if they seem satisfactory to them;


5.77.8
3919
αἰ δέ τι δοκῇ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις , οἴκαδ’ ἀπιάλλην &quot; .
but that if any thing else seem good to the allies, they shall send them away home."


5.78.1
3920
τοῦτον μὲν τὸν λόγον προσεδέξαντο πρῶτον οἱ Ἀργεῖοι , καὶ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τὸ στράτευμα ἀνεχώρησεν ἐκ τῆς Τεγέας ἐπ’ οἴκου ·
This proposal the Argives in the first place accepted, and the army of the Lacedaemonians returned home from Tegea.


5.78.1
3921
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἐπιμειξίας οὔσης ἤδη παρ’ ἀλλήλους , οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον ἔπραξαν αὖθις οἱ αὐτοὶ ἄνδρες ὥστε τὴν Μαντινέων καὶ τὴν Ἀθηναίων καὶ Ἠλείων ξυμμαχίαν ἀφέντας Ἀργείους σπονδὰς καὶ ξυμμαχίαν ποιήσασθαι πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους .
Afterwards, when intercourse with each other was now held by them, not long subsequently the same party again contrived that the Argives should renounce their alliance with the Mantineans, Eleans, and Athenians, and conclude a treaty and alliance with the Lacedaemonians.


5.78.1
3922
καὶ ἐγένοντο αἵδε .
They were the following:


5.79.1
3923
&quot; καττάδε ἔδοξε τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀργείοις σπονδὰς καὶ ξυμμαχίαν ἦμεν πεντήκοντα ἔτη , ἐπὶ τοῖς ἴσοις καὶ ὁμοίοις δίκας διδόντας καττὰ πάτρια ·
" The following are the terms on which it seemed good to the Lacedaemonians and Argives that a treaty and alliance should be concluded between them for fifty years.—That they shall afford to each other judicial decision of differences, on fair and equal terms, according to the institutions of their fathers.—


5.79.1
3924
ταὶ δὲ ἄλλαι πόλιες ταὶ ἐν Πελοποννάσῳ κοινανεόντων τᾶν σπονδᾶν καὶ τᾶς ξυμμαχίας αὐτόνομοι καὶ αὐτοπόλιες , τὰν αὐτῶν ἔχοντες , καττὰ πάτρια δίκας διδόντες τὰς ἴσας καὶ ὁμοίας .
That the other states in the Peloponnese shall participate in this treaty and alliance, as independent and self-governed, retaining their own possessions, and affording fair and equal judicial decisions, according to the institutions of their fathers.—"


5.79.2
3925
ὅσσοι δὲ ἔξω Πελοποννάσω Λακεδαιμονίοις ξύμμαχοί ἐντι , ἐν τοῖς αὐτοῖς ἐσσίονται τοῖσπερ καὶ τοὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ·
" That whatever people out of the Peloponnese are allies of the Lacedaemonians, they shall stand on the same footing as the Lacedaemonians,


5.79.2
3926
καὶ τοὶ τῶν Ἀργείων ξύμμαχοι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ἐσσίονται τῷπερ καὶ τοὶ Ἀργεῖοι , τὰν αὐτῶν ἔχοντες .
and the allies of the Argives on the same footing as the Argives, retaining their own possessions.—"


5.79.3
3927
αἰ δέ ποι στρατείας δέῃ κοινᾶς , βουλεύεσθαι Λακεδαιμονίως καὶ Ἀργείως ὅπᾳ κα δικαιότατα κρίναντας τοῖς ξυμμάχοις .
" That if a common expedition to any quarter should be required, the Lacedaemonians and Argives shall consult upon it, deciding as may be most just for the allies.—"


5.79.4
3928
αἰ δέ τινι τᾶν πολίων ᾖ ἀμφίλλογα , ἢ τᾶν ἐντὸς ἢ τᾶν ἐκτὸς Πελοποννάσω , αἴτε περὶ ὅρων αἴτε περὶ ἄλλω τινός , διακριθῆμεν .
" That if any of the states, either in the Peloponnese or out of it, have any points of dispute, whether concerning their borders or any thing else, they shall be judicially decided.—


5.79.4
3929
αἰ δέ τις τῶν ξυμμάχων πόλις πόλι ἐρίζοι , ἐς πόλιν ἐλθῆν ἅντινα ἴσαν ἀμφοῖν ταῖς πολίεσσι δοκείοι .
That if any of the allied states should have a quarrel with another, they shall have recourse to the arbitration of whatever third state may be thought impartial by both.—


5.79.4
3930
τὼς δὲ ἔτας καττὰ πάτρια δικάζεσθαι &quot; .
That the private citizens in each state shall have their causes tried according to the institutions of their fathers."


5.80.1
3931
αἱ μὲν σπονδαὶ καὶ ἡ ξυμμαχία αὕτη ἐγεγένητο ·
This then was the treaty and alliance that was concluded;


5.80.1
3932
καὶ ὁπόσα ἀλλήλων πολέμῳ ἢ εἴ τι ἄλλο εἶχον , διελύσαντο .
and whatever belonging to each other they had taken in the war, or whatever other ground of difference existed between them, they came to a settlement of all such matters.


5.80.1
3933
κοινῇ δὲ ἤδη τὰ πράγματα τιθέμενοι ἐψηφίσαντο κήρυκα καὶ πρεσβείαν παρ’ Ἀθηναίων μὴ προσδέχεσθαι , ἢν μὴ ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ἐξίωσι τὰ τείχη ἐκλιπόντες , καὶ μὴ ξυμβαίνειν τῳ μηδὲ πολεμεῖν ἀλλ’ ἢ ἅμα .
And as they now arranged their measures in concert, they adopted a resolution not to receive any herald or embassy from the Athenians, unless they withdrew from the Peloponnese, and evacuated their forts;


5.80.2
3934
καὶ τά τε ἄλλα θυμῷ ἔφερον καὶ ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης χωρία καὶ ὡς Περδίκκαν ἔπεμψαν ἀμφότεροι πρέσβεις , καὶ ἀνέπεισαν Περδίκκαν ξυνομόσαι σφίσιν .
and neither to make peace nor carry on war with any, except conjointly.


5.80.2
3935
οὐ μέντοι εὐθύς γε ἀπέστη τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ἀλλὰ διενοεῖτο , ὅτι καὶ τοὺς Ἀργείους ἑώρα ·
And besides conducting their other measures with vehemence, they both of them sent ambassadors to the Thrace-ward towns, and to Perdiccas, whom they persuaded to join their league.


5.80.2
3936
ἦν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἐξ Ἄργους .
He did not, however, immediately separate from the Athenians, but purposed doing so, because he saw that the Argives had also; for he himself was originally from Argos.


5.80.2
3937
καὶ τοῖς Χαλκιδεῦσι τούς τε παλαιοὺς ὅρκους ἀνενεώσαντο καὶ ἄλλους ὤμοσαν .
They likewise renewed their former oaths with the Chalcidians, and bound themselves by new ones.


5.80.3
3938
ἔπεμψαν δὲ καὶ παρὰ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οἱ Ἀργεῖοι πρέσβεις , τὸ ἐξ Ἐπιδαύρου τεῖχος κελεύοντες ἐκλιπεῖν .
Moreover, the Argives sent ambassadors to the Athenians, commanding them to evacuate their fortress in Epidaurus.


5.80.3
3939
οἱ δ’ ὁρῶντες ὀλίγοι πρὸς πλείους ὄντες τοὺς ξυμφύλακας , ἔπεμψαν Δημοσθένη τοὺς σφετέρους ἐξάξοντα .
They therefore, seeing themselves to be but few against many who joined in garrisoning it, sent Demosthenes to lead their men out of it;


5.80.3
3940
ὁ δὲ ἀφικόμενος καὶ ἀγῶνά τινα πρόφασιν γυμνικὸν ἔξω τοῦ φρουρίου ποιήσας , ὡς ἐξῆλθε τὸ ἄλλο φρούριον , ἀπέκλῃσε τὰς πύλας ·
who having arrived, and instituted, by way of pretext, a gymnastic contest outside the fortress, when the rest of the garrison had gone out, shut the gates upon them.


5.80.3
3941
καὶ ὕστερον Ἐπιδαυρίοις ἀνανεωσάμενοι τὰς σπονδὰς αὐτοὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀπέδοσαν τὸ τείχισμα .
Afterwards, having renewed their treaty with the Epidaurians, the Athenians by themselves gave up the fortress.


5.81.1
3942
μετὰ δὲ τὴν τῶν Ἀργείων ἀπόστασιν ἐκ τῆς ξυμμαχίας καὶ οἱ Μαντινῆς , τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἀντέχοντες , ἔπειτ’ οὐ δυνάμενοι ἄνευ τῶν Ἀργείων , ξυνέβησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀφεῖσαν τῶν πόλεων .
Subsequent to the withdrawal of the Argives from the confederacy, the Mantineans, after first holding out, and then finding themselves unable to do so without the Argives, came to terms on their part also with the Lacedaemonians, and relinquished their sovereignty over the cities.


5.81.2
3943
καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ Ἀργεῖοι , χίλιοι ἑκάτεροι , ξυστρατεύσαντες τά τ’ ἐν Σικυῶνι ἐς ὀλίγους μᾶλλον κατέστησαν αὐτοὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐλθόντες , καὶ μετ’ ἐκεῖνα ξυναμφότεροι ἤδη καὶ τὸν ἐν Ἄργει δῆμον κατέλυσαν , καὶ ὀλιγαρχία ἐπιτηδεία τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις κατέστη .
And now the Lacedaemonians and Argives, each a thousand strong, took the field together, and the Lacedaemonians by themselves went and put the government of Sicyon into the hands of a smaller number than before, and then both of them together also put down the democracy at Argos, an oligarchy being established, in accordance with the interests of the Lacedaemonians.


5.81.2
3944
καὶ πρὸς ἔαρ ἤδη ταῦτα ἦν τοῦ χειμῶνος λήγοντος , καὶ τέταρτον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα .
These things occurred at the close of the winter, when spring was now near at hand; and so ended the fourteenth year of the war.


5.82.1
3945
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους Διῆς τε οἱ ἐν Ἄθῳ ἀπέστησαν Ἀθηναίων πρὸς Χαλκιδέας , καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὰ ἐν Ἀχαΐᾳ οὐκ ἐπιτηδείως πρότερον ἔχοντα καθίσταντο .
The following summer, the inhabitants of Dium on Athos revolted from the Athenians to the Chalcidians; and the Lacedaemonians settled the affairs of Achaia, which before had not been suitable to their views.


5.82.2
3946
καὶ Ἀργείων ὁ δῆμος κατ’ ὀλίγον ξυνιστάμενός τε καὶ ἀναθαρσήσας ἐπέθεντο τοῖς ὀλίγοις , τηρήσαντες αὐτὰς τὰς γυμνοπαιδίας τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ·
And now the commons party at Argos, gradually combining and recovering their spirits, made an attack upon the oligarchical party, having watched their opportunity, when it was just the time of the Lacedaemonian Gymnopaediae.


5.82.2
3947
καὶ μάχης γενομένης ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐπεκράτησεν ὁ δῆμος , καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτεινε , τοὺς δὲ ἐξήλασεν .
And a battle having been fought in the city, the commons gained the victory, and slew some of them, and banished others.


5.82.3
3948
οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ἕως μὲν αὐτοὺς μετεπέμποντο οἱ φίλοι , οὐκ ἦλθον ἐκ πλέονος , ἀναβαλόμενοι δὲ τὰς γυμνοπαιδίας ἐβοήθουν .
The Lacedaemonians, while their friends had been sending for them a long time before, did not go; but at length put off the Gymnopaediae, and marched to their aid.


5.82.3
3949
καὶ ἐν Τεγέᾳ πυθόμενοι ὅτι νενίκηνται οἱ ὀλίγοι , προελθεῖν μὲν οὐκέτι ἠθέλησαν δεομένων τῶν διαπεφευγότων , ἀναχωρήσαντες δὲ ἐπ’ οἴκου τὰς γυμνοπαιδίας ἦγον .
On hearing at Tegea that the oligarchical party had been defeated, they would not advance any farther, though entreated by those who had escaped;


5.82.4
3950
καὶ ὕστερον ἐλθόντων πρέσβεων ἀπό τε τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἀγγέλων καὶ τῶν ἔξω Ἀργείων , παρόντων τε τῶν ξυμμάχων καὶ ῥηθέντων πολλῶν ἀφ’ ἑκατέρων ἔγνωσαν μὲν ἀδικεῖν τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει , καὶ ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς στρατεύειν ἐς Ἄργος , διατριβαὶ δὲ καὶ μελλήσεις ἐγίγνοντο .
but returned home, and kept the Gymnopaediae. Afterwards, when ambassadors had come both from the Argives in the city and from those driven out of it, and when the allies also were present, and much had been said on both sides, they decided that the party in the city were in the wrong, and resolved to march against Argos; but much delay and procrastination ensued.


5.82.5
3951
ὁ δὲ δῆμος τῶν Ἀργείων ἐν τούτῳ φοβούμενος τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ξυμμαχίαν πάλιν προσαγόμενός τε καὶ νομίζων μέγιστον ἂν σφᾶς ὠφελῆσαι , τειχίζει μακρὰ τείχη ἐς θάλασσαν , ὅπως , ἢν τῆς γῆς εἴργωνται , ἡ κατὰ θάλασσαν σφᾶς μετὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπαγωγὴ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ὠφελῇ .
In the mean time the commons at Argos were afraid of the Lacedaemonians, and as they courted the alliance of Athens again, and thought it would be of the greatest service to them, they built long walls to the sea; that if they should be excluded from the use of the land, the importation of things by sea, through the help of the Athenians, might be of benefit to them.


5.82.6
3952
ξυνῄδεσαν δὲ τὸν τειχισμὸν καὶ τῶν ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ τινὲς πόλεων .
Some of the cities in the Peloponnese were also privy to their building these walls.


5.82.6
3953
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀργεῖοι πανδημεί , καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ γυναῖκες καὶ οἰκέται , ἐτείχιζον ·
The Argives therefore were engaged in the work with all their population, themselves, their wives, and their slaves;


5.82.6
3954
καὶ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν αὐτοῖς ἦλθον τέκτονες καὶ λιθουργοί .
while there came to them from Athens carpenters and stone-masons.


5.82.6
3955
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And so the summer ended.


5.83.1
3956
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος Λακεδαιμόνιοι ὡς ᾔσθοντο τειχιζόντων , ἐστράτευσαν ἐς τὸ Ἄργος αὐτοί τε καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι πλὴν Κορινθίων ·
The following winter, when the Lacedaemonians were aware of their building the walls, they marched against Argos, both themselves and their allies, excepting the Corinthians.


5.83.1
3957
ὑπῆρχε δέ τι αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Ἄργους αὐτόθεν πρασσόμενον .
There was some communication being also held with them from Argos itself.


5.83.1
3958
ἦγε δὲ τὴν στρατιὰν Ἆγις ὁ Ἀρχιδάμου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς .
The leader of the army was Agis, son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians.


5.83.2
3959
καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως δοκοῦντα προϋπάρχειν οὐ προυχώρησεν ἔτι ·
With regard, then, to the advantages which they thought they had secured in the city itself, nothing more came of them;


5.83.2
3960
τὰ δὲ οἰκοδομούμενα τείχη ἑλόντες καὶ καταβαλόντες καὶ Ὑσιὰς χωρίον τῆς Ἀργείας λαβόντες καὶ τοὺς ἐλευθέρους ἅπαντας οὓς ἔλαβον ἀποκτείναντες ἀνεχώρησαν καὶ διελύθησαν κατὰ πόλεις .
And having taken Hysiae, a town in the Argive territory, and put to the sword all the free-men they got into their hands, they returned, and dispersed to their respective cities.


5.83.3
3961
ἐστράτευσαν δὲ μετὰ τοῦτο καὶ Ἀργεῖοι ἐς τὴν Φλειασίαν καὶ δῃώσαντες ἀπῆλθον , ὅτι σφῶν τοὺς φυγάδας ὑπεδέχοντο ·
After this, the Argives, in their turn, marched against the Phliasian country, and laid it waste before they returned, because they harboured their exiles;


5.83.3
3962
οἱ γὰρ πολλοὶ αὐτῶν ἐνταῦθα κατῴκηντο .
for the greater part of them had settled there.


5.83.4
3963
κατέκλῃσαν δὲ τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος καὶ Μακεδόνας Ἀθηναῖοι , Περδίκκᾳ ἐπικαλοῦντες τήν τε πρὸς Ἀργείους καὶ Λακεδαιμονίους γενομένην ξυνωμοσίαν , καὶ ὅτι παρασκευασαμένων αὐτῶν στρατιὰν ἄγειν ἐπὶ Χαλκιδέας τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης καὶ Ἀμφίπολιν Νικίου τοῦ Νικηράτου στρατηγοῦντος ἔψευστο τὴν ξυμμαχίαν καὶ ἡ στρατεία μάλιστα διελύθη ἐκείνου † ἀπάραντος † ·
The Athenians ravaged, too, during the same winter a part of Macedonia also, charging Perdiccas with the league he had entered into with the Argives and Lacedaemonians;


5.83.4
3964
πολέμιος οὖν ἦν .
He was therefore proclaimed an enemy.


5.83.4
3965
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα οὗτος , καὶ πέμπτον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα .
And thus the winter ended, and the fifteenth year of the war.


5.84.1
3966
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους Ἀλκιβιάδης τε πλεύσας ἐς Ἄργος ναυσὶν εἴκοσιν Ἀργείων τοὺς δοκοῦντας ἔτι ὑπόπτους εἶναι καὶ τὰ Λακεδαιμονίων φρονεῖν ἔλαβε τριακοσίους ἄνδρας , καὶ κατέθεντο αὐτοὺς Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὰς ἐγγὺς νήσους ὧν ἦρχον ·
The next summer, Alcibiades sailed to Argos with twenty ships, and seized three hundred men, who were still thought to be suspicious characters, and to favour the cause of the Lacedaemonians; and these the Athenians deposited in the neighbouring islands within their dominions.


5.84.1
3967
καὶ ἐπὶ Μῆλον τὴν νῆσον Ἀθηναῖοι ἐστράτευσαν ναυσὶν ἑαυτῶν μὲν τριάκοντα , Χίαις δὲ ἕξ , Λεσβίαιν δὲ δυοῖν , καὶ ὁπλίταις ἑαυτῶν μὲν διακοσίοις καὶ χιλίοις καὶ τοξόταις τριακοσίοις καὶ ἱπποτοξόταις εἴκοσι , τῶν δὲ ξυμμάχων καὶ νησιωτῶν ὁπλίταις μάλιστα πεντακοσίοις καὶ χιλίοις .
The Athenians also undertook an expedition against the island of Melos, with thirty ships of their own, six of the Chians, two of the Lesbians, sixteen hundred of their own heavy-armed, three hundred bowmen, twenty mounted archers, and about five thousand five hundred heavy-armed of the allies and the islanders.


5.84.2
3968
οἱ δὲ Μήλιοι Λακεδαιμονίων μέν εἰσιν ἄποικοι , τῶν δ’ Ἀθηναίων οὐκ ἤθελον ὑπακούειν ὥσπερ οἱ ἄλλοι νησιῶται , ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον οὐδετέρων ὄντες ἡσύχαζον , ἔπειτα ὡς αὐτοὺς ἠνάγκαζον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι δῃοῦντες τὴν γῆν , ἐς πόλεμον φανερὸν κατέστησαν .
Now the Melians are a colony of the Lacedaemonians, and would not submit to the Athenians, like the rest of the islanders, but at first remained quiet as neutrals, and then, when the Athenians tried to compel them by devastating their land, went openly to war with them.


5.84.3
3969
στρατοπεδευσάμενοι οὖν ἐς τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν τῇ παρασκευῇ ταύτῃ οἱ στρατηγοὶ Κλεομήδης τε ὁ Λυκομήδους καὶ Τεισίας ὁ Τεισιμάχου , πρὶν ἀδικεῖν τι τῆς γῆς , λόγους πρῶτον ποιησομένους ἔπεμψαν πρέσβεις .
The generals therefore, Cleomedes son of Lycomedes, and Tisias son of Tisimachus, having gone and encamped in their territory with this armament, before injuring any part of the land, first sent ambassadors to hold a conference with them.


5.84.3
3970
οὓς οἱ Μήλιοι πρὸς μὲν τὸ πλῆθος οὐκ ἤγαγον , ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἀρχαῖς καὶ τοῖς ὀλίγοις λέγειν ἐκέλευον περὶ ὧν ἥκουσιν .
These the Melians did not introduce to their popular assembly, but desired them to state the objects of their mission before the magistrates and the few.


5.85.1
3971
οἱ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων πρέσβεις ἔλεγον τοιάδε .
The ambassadors of the Athenians then spoke as follows:


5.85.1
3972
&quot; ἐπειδὴ οὐ πρὸς τὸ πλῆθος οἱ λόγοι γίγνονται , ὅπως δὴ μὴ ξυνεχεῖ ῥήσει οἱ πολλοὶ ἐπαγωγὰ καὶ ἀνέλεγκτα ἐσάπαξ ἀκούσαντες ἡμῶν ἀπατηθῶσιν ( γιγνώσκομεν γὰρ ὅτι τοῦτο φρονεῖ ἡμῶν ἡ ἐς τοὺς ὀλίγους ἀγωγή ) , ὑμεῖς οἱ καθήμενοι ἔτι ἀσφαλέστερον ποιήσατε .
"Since our words are not to be addressed to your populace, in order that the many may not be deceived, forsooth, by hearing at once in one continuous oration persuasive and irrefutable arguments, (for we know that this is the meaning of your introducing us to the few,) do ye who are seated here in congress pursue a still more cautious method.


5.85.1
3973
καθ’ ἕκαστον γὰρ καὶ μηδ’ ὑμεῖς ἑνὶ λόγῳ , ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὸ μὴ δοκοῦν ἐπιτηδείως λέγεσθαι εὐθὺς ὑπολαμβάνοντες κρίνετε .
For do not ye, either, make one continuous speech on the several topics, but immediately taking us up at whatever does not appear to be advanced in accordance with your interest, decide that question.


5.85.1
3974
καὶ πρῶτον εἰ ἀρέσκει ὡς λέγομεν εἴπατε &quot; .
And first tell us if you are pleased with what we propose."


5.86.1
3975
οἱ δὲ τῶν Μηλίων ξύνεδροι ἀπεκρίναντο &quot; ἡ μὲν ἐπιείκεια τοῦ διδάσκειν καθ’ ἡσυχίαν ἀλλήλους οὐ ψέγεται , τὰ δὲ τοῦ πολέμου παρόντα ἤδη καὶ οὐ μέλλοντα διαφέροντα αὐτοῦ φαίνεται .
The commissioners of the Melians made this reply: "The fairness of thus calmly instructing each other is open to no objection: but your preparations for war, which are already here, and not merely coming, appear to be at variance with it.


5.86.1
3976
ὁρῶμεν γὰρ αὐτούς τε κριτὰς ἥκοντας ὑμᾶς τῶν λεχθησομένων καὶ τὴν τελευτὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς περιγενομένοις μὲν τῷ δικαίῳ καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ μὴ ἐνδοῦσι πόλεμον ἡμῖν φέρουσαν , πεισθεῖσι δὲ δουλείαν &quot; .
For we see that you are come to be yourselves judges of what will be said; and that the issue of the conference will in all probability bring us war, if we are stronger in the justice of our cause, and therefore refuse to submit; or slavery, if we are convinced by you."


5.87.1
3977
εἰ μὲν τοίνυν ὑπονοίας τῶν μελλόντων λογιούμενοι ἢ ἄλλο τι ξυνήκετε ἢ ἐκ τῶν παρόντων καὶ ὧν ὁρᾶτε περὶ σωτηρίας βουλεύσοντες τῇ πόλει , παυοίμεθ’ ἄν ·
The Athenians responded: "If now you have met to argue upon suspicions of the future, or to do any thing else but to consult for your country with a view to its preservation, according to what is present and before your eyes, we will stop;


5.87.1
3978
εἰ δ’ ἐπὶ τοῦτο , λέγοιμεν ἄν .
but if for this object, we will speak."


5.88.1
3979
εἰκὸς μὲν καὶ ξυγγνώμη ἐν τῷ τοιῷδε καθεστῶτας ἐπὶ πολλὰ καὶ λέγοντας καὶ δοκοῦντας τρέπεσθαι ·
The Melians replied: "It is but natural and pardonable for men so circumstanced to have recourse to many things, both in thinking and speaking.


5.88.1
3980
ἡ μέντοι ξύνοδος καὶ περὶ σωτηρίας ἥδε πάρεστι , καὶ ὁ λόγος ᾧ προκαλεῖσθε τρόπῳ , εἰ δοκεῖ , γιγνέσθω .
However, this our meeting held with a view to our preservation; and let the discussion proceed, if you please, in the way which you propose."


5.89.1
3981
ἡμεῖς τοίνυν οὔτε αὐτοὶ μετ’ ὀνομάτων καλῶν , ὡς ἢ δικαίως τὸν Μῆδον καταλύσαντες ἄρχομεν ἢ ἀδικούμενοι νῦν ἐπεξερχόμεθα , λόγων μῆκος ἄπιστον παρέξομεν , οὔθ’ ὑμᾶς ἀξιοῦμεν ἢ ὅτι Λακεδαιμονίων ἄποικοι ὄντες οὐ ξυνεστρατεύσατε ἢ ὡς ἡμᾶς οὐδὲν ἠδικήκατε λέγοντας οἴεσθαι πείσειν , τὰ δυνατὰ δ’ ἐξ ὧν ἑκάτεροι ἀληθῶς φρονοῦμεν διαπράσσεσθαι , ἐπισταμένους πρὸς εἰδότας ὅτι δίκαια μὲν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρωπείῳ λόγῳ ἀπὸ τῆς ἴσης ἀνάγκης κρίνεται , δυνατὰ δὲ οἱ προύχοντες πράσσουσι καὶ οἱ ἀσθενεῖς ξυγχωροῦσιν .
" We then shall not ourselves advance fair pretences, either of our justly enjoying empire in consequence of having overthrown the Mede, or of now coming against you because we are being injured-and so make a long speech which would not be believed; nor do we wish you to think of persuading us by saying, either that you did not join the standard of the Lacedaemonians, though you were their colony; or that you have done us no wrong. But we advise you, according to the real sentiments of us both, to think of getting what you can; since you know, and are speaking to those who know, that, in the language of men, what is estimated by equality of power compel; but what is possible is that which the stronger practise, and to which the weak submit."


5.90.1
3982
ἧι μὲν δὴ νομίζομέν γε , χρήσιμον ( ἀνάγκη γάρ , ἐπειδὴ ὑμεῖς οὕτω παρὰ τὸ δίκαιον τὸ ξυμφέρον λέγειν ὑπέθεσθε ) μὴ καταλύειν ὑμᾶς τὸ κοινὸν ἀγαθόν , ἀλλὰ τῷ αἰεὶ ἐν κινδύνῳ γιγνομένῳ εἶναι τὰ εἰκότα καὶ δίκαια , καί τι καὶ ἐντὸς τοῦ ἀκριβοῦς πείσαντά τινα ὠφεληθῆναι .
The Athenians continued: "So far then as our opinion goes, it is for our advantage (for we must, since you have so prescribed, speak of what is expedient, to the neglect of what is right) that you should not take away what is a common benefit;


5.90.1
3983
καὶ πρὸς ὑμῶν οὐχ ἧσσον τοῦτο , ὅσῳ καὶ ἐπὶ μεγίστῃ τιμωρίᾳ σφαλέντες ἂν τοῖς ἄλλοις παράδειγμα γένοισθε .
but that for every one who at any time is in danger, what is reasonable should also be considered right; and that if he can gain assent to something which falls short of strict justice, he should have the benefit of it. And this is not less for your interest; in as much, as you would afford to others, should you fail, a pattern for inflicting the heaviest vengeance upon you."


5.91.1
3984
ἡμεῖς δὲ τῆς ἡμετέρας ἀρχῆς , ἢν καὶ παυθῇ , οὐκ ἀθυμοῦμεν τὴν τελευτήν ·
The Athenians further added: "Nay, for our part, we are not disheartened about the end of our empire, even should it be brought to an end.


5.91.1
3985
οὐ γὰρ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἄλλων , ὥσπερ καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , οὗτοι δεινοὶ τοῖς νικηθεῖσιν ( ἔστι δὲ οὐ πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους ἡμῖν ὁ ἀγών ) , ἀλλ’ ἢν οἱ ὑπήκοοί που τῶν ἀρξάντων αὐτοὶ ἐπιθέμενοι κρατήσωσιν .
For it is not those who rule over others, like the Lacedaemonians, that are to be feared by the vanquished. Nor is it with the Lacedaemonians that we have to struggle, but with the possibility of our subjects in any quarter by themselves attacking and overpowering those who have had rule over them."


5.91.2
3986
καὶ περὶ μὲν τούτου ἡμῖν ἀφείσθω κινδυνεύεσθαι ·
They also stated: "So on this point let the danger be left to us.


5.91.2
3987
ὡς δὲ ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ τε πάρεσμεν τῆς ἡμετέρας ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ νῦν τοὺς λόγους ἐροῦμεν τῆς ὑμετέρας πόλεως , ταῦτα δηλώσομεν , βουλόμενοι ἀπόνως μὲν ὑμῶν ἄρξαι , χρησίμως δ’ ὑμᾶς ἀμφοτέροις σωθῆναι .
But that we are come here for the benefit of our empire, and that we shall also speak on the present occasion for the preservation of your country, on these points we will give you proofs; since we wish to maintain our own sovereignty over you without trouble, and to have you preserved for the advantage of us both."


5.92.1
3988
καὶ πῶς χρήσιμον ἂν ξυμβαίη ἡμῖν δουλεῦσαι , ὥσπερ καὶ ὑμῖν ἄρξαι ;
" And how then could it prove advantageous for us to serve, as it is for you to govern?"


5.93.1
3989
ὅτι ὑμῖν μὲν πρὸ τοῦ τὰ δεινότατα παθεῖν ὑπακοῦσαι ἂν γένοιτο , ἡμεῖς δὲ μὴ διαφθείραντες ὑμᾶς κερδαίνοιμεν ἄν .
" Because you would have the benefit of submitting before you suffered the last extremities; while we should be gainers by not destroying you."


5.94.1
3990
ὥστε δὲ ἡσυχίαν ἄγοντας ἡμᾶς φίλους μὲν εἶναι ἀντὶ πολεμίων , ξυμμάχους δὲ μηδετέρων , οὐκ ἂν δέξαισθε ;
" But would you not accept our proposals, on condition of our remaining quiet, and being friends instead of enemies, but in alliance with neither side?"


5.95.1
3991
οὐ γὰρ τοσοῦτον ἡμᾶς βλάπτει ἡ ἔχθρα ὑμῶν ὅσον ἡ φιλία μὲν ἀσθενείας , τὸ δὲ μῖσος δυνάμεως παράδειγμα τοῖς ἀρχομένοις δηλούμενον .
" No; for your enmity is not so hurtful to us, as your friendship is to our subjects an evident proof of our weakness, but your hatred, of our power."


5.96.1
3992
σκοποῦσι δ’ ὑμῶν οὕτως οἱ ὑπήκοοι τὸ εἰκός , ὥστε τούς τε μὴ προσήκοντας καὶ ὅσοι ἄποικοι ὄντες οἱ πολλοὶ καὶ ἀποστάντες τινὲς κεχείρωνται ἐς τὸ αὐτὸ τιθέασιν ;
" And do your subjects then take such a view of equity, as to put on the same footing those who are not at all connected with you, and those who, being in most cases your colonists, and in some cases having revolted from you, have been reduced to subjection?"


5.97.1
3993
δικαιώματι γὰρ οὐδετέρους ἐλλείπειν ἡγοῦνται , κατὰ δύναμιν δὲ τοὺς μὲν περιγίγνεσθαι , ἡμᾶς δὲ φόβῳ οὐκ ἐπιέναι ·
The Athenians concluded: "Why, for an argument resting on justice they think that neither of us are at a loss; but that on the ground of their power they escape, and we, through fear, abstain from attacking them.


5.97.1
3994
ὥστε ἔξω καὶ τοῦ πλεόνων ἄρξαι καὶ τὸ ἀσφαλὲς ἡμῖν διὰ τὸ καταστραφῆναι ἂν παράσχοιτε , ἄλλως τε καὶ νησιῶται ναυκρατόρων καὶ ἀσθενέστεροι ἑτέρων ὄντες εἰ μὴ περιγένοισθε .
So that, besides our ruling over more subjects, you would also through your subjection confer security upon us; especially by the fact that you who are islanders, and weaker too than some others, did not escape our dominion, who have the command of the sea."


5.98.1
3995
ἐν δ’ ἐκείνῳ οὐ νομίζετε ἀσφάλειαν ;
The Melians asked: "And do you consider that there is no security in that other case?


5.98.1
3996
δεῖ γὰρ αὖ καὶ ἐνταῦθα , ὥσπερ ὑμεῖς τῶν δικαίων λόγων ἡμᾶς ἐκβιβάσαντες τῷ ὑμετέρῳ ξυμφόρῳ ὑπακούειν πείθετε , καὶ ἡμᾶς τὸ ἡμῖν χρήσιμον διδάσκοντας , εἰ τυγχάνει καὶ ὑμῖν τὸ αὐτὸ ξυμβαῖνον , πειρᾶσθαι πείθειν .
(For here again, as you have excluded us from appeals to justice, and urge us to yield to considerations of your advantage, we too must explain what is expedient for us, and so endeavour to persuade you, if the same happen to be for your interest also.)


5.98.1
3997
ὅσοι γὰρ νῦν μηδετέροις ξυμμαχοῦσι , πῶς οὐ πολεμώσεσθε αὐτούς , ὅταν ἐς τάδε βλέψαντες ἡγήσωνταί ποτε ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ σφᾶς ἥξειν ;
For how can you avoid making enemies of all that are at present neutral, when, on looking to the present case, they reckon that some time or other you will proceed against them also?


5.98.1
3998
κ- ἐν τούτῳ τί ἄλλο ἢ τοὺς μὲν ὑπάρχοντας πολεμίους μεγαλύνετε , τοὺς δὲ μηδὲ μελλήσαντας γενέσθαι ἄκοντας ἐπάγεσθε ;
And by that course what do you do, but aggrandize your present enemies, and bring those upon you against their will who would never else be likely to become hostile to you?"


5.99.1
3999
οὐ γὰρ νομίζομεν ἡμῖν τούτους δεινοτέρους ὅσοι ἠπειρῶταί που ὄντες τῷ ἐλευθέρῳ πολλὴν τὴν διαμέλλησιν τῆς πρὸς ἡμᾶς φυλακῆς ποιήσονται , ἀλλὰ τοὺς νησιώτας τέ που ἀνάρκτους , ὥσπερ ὑμᾶς , καὶ τοὺς ἤδη τῆς ἀρχῆς τῷ ἀναγκαίῳ παροξυνομένους .
"Why, we do not consider those who live any where on the mainland, and who in consequence of their liberty will long delay taking precautions against us, to be so formidable to us as those who are islanders any where without being under our rule, like you, and those who by the severity of our rule are now exasperated against us.


5.99.1
4000
οὗτοι γὰρ πλεῖστ’ ἂν τῷ ἀλογίστῳ ἐπιτρέψαντες σφᾶς τε αὐτοὺς καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐς προῦπτον κίνδυνον καταστήσειαν .
For it is these who would most give way to recklessness, and bring both themselves and us into danger that was evident beforehand."


5.100.1
4001
ἦ που ἄρα , εἰ τοσαύτην γε ὑμεῖς τε μὴ παυθῆναι ἀρχῆς καὶ οἱ δουλεύοντες ἤδη ἀπαλλαγῆναι τὴν παρακινδύνευσιν ποιοῦνται , ἡμῖν γε τοῖς ἔτι ἐλευθέροις πολλὴ κακότης καὶ δειλία μὴ πᾶν πρὸ τοῦ δουλεῦσαι ἐπεξελθεῖν .
" Surely then, if you run such a risk not to be deprived of your empire, and those who are already in subjection, to be released from it; for us who are still free it were great baseness and cowardice not to have recourse to every thing before we submit to it."


5.101.1
4002
οὔκ , ἤν γε σωφρόνως βουλεύησθε ·
"No; not at least if you take a sensible view of the case.


5.101.1
4003
οὐ γὰρ περὶ ἀνδραγαθίας ὁ ἀγὼν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ὑμῖν , μὴ αἰσχύνην ὀφλεῖν , περὶ δὲ σωτηρίας μᾶλλον ἡ βουλή , πρὸς τοὺς κρείσσονας πολλῷ μὴ ἀνθίστασθαι .
For you are not on equal terms contending for honour, to avoid incurring disgrace; but you are rather deliberating for your preservation, to avoid resisting those who are far stronger than yourselves."


5.102.1
4004
ἀλλ’ ἐπιστάμεθα τὰ τῶν πολέμων ἔστιν ὅτε κοινοτέρας τὰς τύχας λαμβάνοντα ἢ κατὰ τὸ διαφέρον ἑκατέρων πλῆθος ·
"But we know that warlike measures sometimes come to more impartial results than might have been expected from the different numbers on each side.


5.102.1
4005
καὶ ἡμῖν τὸ μὲν εἶξαι εὐθὺς ἀνέλπιστον , μετὰ δὲ τοῦ δρωμένου ἔτι καὶ στῆναι ἐλπὶς ὀρθῶς .
And in our case to yield is immediate despair; but by making an effort there is yet hope of our keeping ourselves up."


5.103.1
4006
ἐλπὶς δὲ κινδύνῳ παραμύθιον οὖσα τοὺς μὲν ἀπὸ περιουσίας χρωμένους αὐτῇ , κἂν βλάψῃ , οὐ καθεῖλεν ·
"Hope, which is the solace of danger, when entertained by those who have abundant means, though it may injure, yet does not ruin them.


5.103.1
4007
τοῖς δ’ ἐς ἅπαν τὸ ὑπάρχον ἀναρριπτοῦσι ( δάπανος γὰρ φύσει ) ἅμα τε γιγνώσκεται σφαλέντων καὶ ἐν ὅτῳ ἔτι φυλάξεταί τις αὐτὴν γνωρισθεῖσαν οὐκ ἐλλείπει .
But in the case of those who risk all they have on a throw, (for it is naturally an extravagant passion,) it is only found out at the time of their ruin, and leaves no room for guarding against it in future, when it is found out."


5.103.2
4008
ὃ ὑμεῖς ἀσθενεῖς τε καὶ ἐπὶ ῥοπῆς μιᾶς ὄντες μὴ βούλεσθε παθεῖν μηδὲ ὁμοιωθῆναι τοῖς πολλοῖς , οἷς παρὸν ἀνθρωπείως ἔτι σῴζεσθαι , ἐπειδὰν πιεζομένους αὐτοὺς ἐπιλίπωσιν αἱ φανεραὶ ἐλπίδες , ἐπὶ τὰς ἀφανεῖς καθίστανται μαντικήν τε καὶ χρησμοὺς καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα μετ’ ἐλπίδων λυμαίνεται .
" Do not you then, weak as you are, and hanging on one single turn of the scale, be desirous of this fate, nor of resembling the greater part of mankind, who, when they might have been saved by human means, after visible hopes have failed them in their distress, betake themselves to such as are invisible, namely, prophecy, and oracles, and all such things as bring men to ruin, together with the hopes resting upon them."


5.104.1
4009
χαλεπὸν μὲν καὶ ἡμεῖς ( εὖ ἴστε ) νομίζομεν πρὸς δύναμίν τε τὴν ὑμετέραν καὶ τὴν τύχην , εἰ μὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ἔσται , ἀγωνίζεσθαι ·
"Difficult indeed even we, be well assured, consider it to contend against your power and fortune, unless we are able to do it on equal terms.


5.104.1
4010
ὅμως δὲ πιστεύομεν τῇ μὲν τύχῃ ἐκ τοῦ θείου μὴ ἐλασσώσεσθαι , ὅτι ὅσιοι πρὸς οὐ δικαίους ἱστάμεθα , τῆς δὲ δυνάμεως τῷ ἐλλείποντι τὴν Λακεδαιμονίων ἡμῖν ξυμμαχίαν προσέσεσθαι , ἀνάγκην ἔχουσαν , καὶ εἰ μή του ἄλλου , τῆς γε ξυγγενείας ἕνεκα καὶ αἰσχύνῃ βοηθεῖν .
However, we trust that in point of fortune we shall, by the favour of the gods, not be worsted, because we are standing up in a righteous cause against unjust opponents; and that our deficiency in power will be made up by our Lacedaemonian allies; who are under a necessity of succouring us, if for no other reason, yet on account of our connexion with them, and for very shame.


5.104.1
4011
καὶ οὐ παντάπασιν οὕτως ἀλόγως θρασυνόμεθα .
And we do not utterly without reason take courage."


5.105.1
4012
τῆς μὲν τοίνυν πρὸς τὸ θεῖον εὐμενείας οὐδ’ ἡμεῖς οἰόμεθα λελείψεσθαι ·
"As regards then the favour of heaven, we trust that we too shall not fall short of it:


5.105.1
4013
οὐδὲν γὰρ ἔξω τῆς ἀνθρωπείας τῶν μὲν ἐς τὸ θεῖον νομίσεως , τῶν δ’ ἐς σφᾶς αὐτοὺς βουλήσεως δικαιοῦμεν ἢ πράσσομεν .
since we are not requiring or doing any thing beyond the opinion of men, with respect to the gods, or their determination, with respect to themselves."


5.105.2
4014
ἡγούμεθα γὰρ τό τε θεῖον δόξῃ τὸ ἀνθρώπειόν τε σαφῶς διὰ παντὸς ὑπὸ φύσεως ἀναγκαίας , οὗ ἂν κρατῇ , ἄρχειν ·
"For of the gods we hold as a matter of opinion, and of men we know as a certainty, that, in obedience to an irresistible instinct, they always maintain dominion, wherever they are the stronger.


5.105.2
4015
καὶ ἡμεῖς οὔτε θέντες τὸν νόμον οὔτε κειμένῳ πρῶτοι χρησάμενοι , ὄντα δὲ παραλαβόντες καὶ ἐσόμενον ἐς αἰεὶ καταλείψοντες χρώμεθα αὐτῷ , εἰδότες καὶ ὑμᾶς ἂν καὶ ἄλλους ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ δυνάμει ἡμῖν γενομένους δρῶντας ἂν τ- αὐτό .
And we neither enacted this law, nor were the first to carry it out when enacted; but having received it when already in force, and being about to leave it after us to be in force for ever, we only avail ourselves of it; knowing that both you and others, if raised to the same power, would do the same."


5.105.3
4016
καὶ πρὸς μὲν τὸ θεῖον οὕτως ἐκ τοῦ εἰκότος οὐ φοβούμεθα ἐλασσώσεσθαι ·
"And so, with regard to the gods, we are with good reason fearless of defeat.


5.105.3
4017
τῆς δὲ ἐς Λακεδαιμονίους δόξης , ἣν διὰ τὸ αἰσχρὸν δὴ βοηθήσειν ὑμῖν πιστεύετε αὐτούς , μακαρίσαντες ὑμῶν τὸ ἀπειρόκακον οὐ ζηλοῦμεν τὸ ἄφρον .
But with regard to your opinion respecting the Lacedaemonians, according to which you trust, that from a sense of shame, forsooth, they will assist you; though we bless your simplicity, we do not admire your folly."


5.105.4
4018
Λακεδαιμόνιοι γὰρ πρὸς σφᾶς μὲν αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰ ἐπιχώρια νόμιμα πλεῖστα ἀρετῇ χρῶνται ·
"For with respect to themselves, and the institutions of their country, the Lacedaemonians do indeed to a very great extent practise virtue;


5.105.4
4019
πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ἄλλους πολλὰ ἄν τις ἔχων εἰπεῖν ὡς προσφέρονται , ξυνελὼν μάλιστ’ ἂν δηλώσειεν ὅτι ἐπιφανέστατα ὧν ἴσμεν τὰ μὲν ἡδέα καλὰ νομίζουσι , τὰ δὲ ξυμφέροντα δίκαια .
but with respect to others, though we might descant at length on their conduct towards them, speaking most concisely we should declare, that of all the men we are acquainted with, most evident consider what is agreeable to be honourable, and what is expedient to be just.


5.105.4
4020
καίτοι οὐ πρὸς τῆς ὑμετέρας νῦν ἀλόγου σωτηρίας ἡ τοιαύτη διάνοια .
And yet such a view of things is not in favour of your present unreasonable hopes of safety."


5.106.1
4021
ἡμεῖς δὲ κατ’ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἤδη καὶ μάλιστα πιστεύομεν τῷ ξυμφέροντι αὐτῶν , Μηλίους ἀποίκους ὄντας μὴ βουλήσεσθαι προδόντας τοῖς μὲν εὔνοις τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἀπίστους καταστῆναι , τοῖς δὲ πολεμίοις ὠφελίμους .
" But it is on this very ground that we now rely on their sense of interest, and believe that they will not be tray us Melians, who are their colonists, and so lose the confidence of those Greeks who wish them well, while they help those who are hostile to them."


5.107.1
4022
οὔκουν οἴεσθε τὸ ξυμφέρον μὲν μετ’ ἀσφαλείας εἶναι , τὸ δὲ δίκαιον καὶ καλὸν μετὰ κινδύνου δρᾶσθαι ·
"Then you do not think that interest is connected with security, whereas justice and honour are practised with danger;


5.107.1
4023
ὃ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἥκιστα ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ τολμῶσιν .
a course on which the Lacedaemonians, generally speaking, least of all men venture."


5.108.1
4024
ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς κινδύνους τε ἡμῶν ἕνεκα μᾶλλον ἡγούμεθ’ ἂν ἐγχειρίσασθαι αὐτούς , καὶ βεβαιοτέρους ἢ ἐς ἄλλους νομιεῖν , ὅσῳ πρὸς μὲν τὰ ἔργα τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἐγγὺς κείμεθα , τῆς δὲ γνώμης τῷ ξυγγενεῖ πιστότεροι ἑτέρων ἐσμέν .
" Nay, but we are of opinion that they would even incur dangers for our sake, more than usual, and would regard them as less hazardous than in the case of others; in as much as we he near the Peloponnese, for the execution of their measures; while in feeling we are, through our kindred with them, more to be trusted than another party would be."


5.109.1
4025
τὸ δ’ ἐχυρόν γε τοῖς ξυναγωνιουμένοις οὐ τὸ εὔνουν τῶν ἐπικαλεσαμένων φαίνεται , ἀλλ’ ἢν τῶν ἔργων τις δυνάμει πολὺ προύχῃ ·
"Ay, but to men going to take part in a quarrel safety does not appear to consist in the good feeling of those who call them to their aid, but in the fact of their being far superior in power for action;


5.109.1
4026
ὃ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ πλέον τι τῶν ἄλλων σκοποῦσιν ( τῆς γοῦν οἰκείας παρασκευῆς ἀπιστίᾳ καὶ μετὰ ξυμμάχων πολλῶν τοῖς πέλας ἐπέρχονται ) , ὥστε οὐκ εἰκὸς ἐς νῆσόν γε αὐτοὺς ἡμῶν ναυκρατόρων ὄντων περαιωθῆναι .
and the Lacedaemonians look to this even more than the rest of the world. At any rate, through their mistrusting their own resources, it is only in concert with many allies that they attack those who are near to them; so that it is not likely they will cross over to an island while we are masters of the sea."


5.110.1
4027
οἱ δὲ καὶ ἄλλους ἂν ἔχοιεν πέμψαι ·
"But they would have others to send;


5.110.1
4028
πολὺ δὲ τὸ Κρητικὸν πέλαγος , δι’ οὗ τῶν κρατούντων ἀπορώτερος ἡ λῆψις ἢ τῶν λαθεῖν βουλομένων ἡ σωτηρία .
and the Cretan sea is of wide extent, and to intercept a party in crossing it is more difficult for those who command it, than to escape is for those who wish to elude observation."


5.110.2
4029
καὶ εἰ τοῦδε σφάλλοιντο , τράποιντ’ ἂν καὶ ἐς τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς τῶν ξυμμάχων , ὅσους μὴ Βρασίδας ἐπῆλθεν ·
"Besides, if they should be disappointed in this, they would proceed against your territory, and to the remainder of your allies, such as Brasidas did not reach:


5.110.2
4030
καὶ οὐ περὶ τῆς μὴ προσηκούσης μᾶλλον ἢ τῆς οἰκειοτέρας ξυμμαχίδος τε καὶ γῆς ὁ πόνος ὑμῖν ἔσται .
and you will have to exert yourselves, not so much for territory which does not belong to you, as for your own confederacy and country."


5.111.1
4031
τούτων μὲν καὶ πεπειραμένοις ἄν τι γένοιτο καὶ ὑμῖν καὶ οὐκ ἀνεπιστήμοσιν ὅτι οὐδ’ ἀπὸ μιᾶς πώποτε πολιορκίας Ἀθηναῖοι δι’ ἄλλων φόβον ἀπεχώρησαν .
" On this point you, as well as others, may learn by actual experience, and not remain ignorant, that from no single siege did the Athenians ever yet retreat through fear of others."


5.111.2
4032
ἐνθυμούμεθα δὲ ὅτι φήσαντες περὶ σωτηρίας βουλεύσειν οὐδὲν ἐν τοσούτῳ λόγῳ εἰρήκατε ᾧ ἄνθρωποι ἂν πιστεύσαντες νομίσειαν σωθήσεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ὑμῶν τὰ μὲν ἰσχυρότατα ἐλπιζόμενα μέλλεται , τὰ δ’ ὑπάρχοντα βραχέα πρὸς τὰ ἤδη ἀντιτεταγμένα περιγίγνεσθαι .
"But it strikes us, that though you said you would consult for the safety of your country, you have in all this long discussion advanced nothing which men might trust to for thinking that they would be saved; but your strongest points depend on hope and futurity, while your present resources are too scanty, compared with those at present opposed to you, to give you a chance of escape.


5.111.2
4033
πολλήν τε ἀλογίαν τῆς διανοίας παρέχετε , εἰ μὴ μεταστησάμενοι ἔτι ἡμᾶς ἄλλο τι τῶνδε σωφρονέστερον γνώσεσθε .
And so you afford proof of great folly in your views, if you do not even yet, after allowing us to retire, adopt some counsel more prudent than this."


5.111.3
4034
οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἐπί γε τὴν ἐν τοῖς αἰσχροῖς καὶ προύπτοις κινδύνοις πλεῖστα διαφθείρουσαν ἀνθρώπους αἰσχύνην τρέψεσθε .
"For you surely will not betake yourselves to that shame, which in dangers that are disgraceful, because foreseen, destroys men more than any thing else.


5.111.3
4035
πολλοῖς γὰρ προορωμένοις ἔτι ἐς οἷα φέρονται τὸ αἰσχρὸν καλούμενον ὀνόματος ἐπαγωγοῦ δυνάμει ἐπεσπάσατο ἡσσηθεῖσι τοῦ ῥήματος ἔργῳ ξυμφοραῖς ἀνηκέστοις ἑκόντας περιπεσεῖν καὶ αἰσχύνην αἰσχίω μετὰ ἀνοίας ἢ τύχῃ προσλαβεῖν .
For in the case of many men, though they foresee all the time what they are running into, the thing which is called disgrace, by the influence of a seducing name, allures them on, enslaved as they are to the word, in fact to fall wilfully into irretrievable disasters, and to incur a shame more shameful as the attendant on folly than on fortune."


5.111.4
4036
ὃ ὑμεῖς , ἢν εὖ βουλεύησθε , φυλάξεσθε , καὶ οὐκ ἀπρεπὲς νομιεῖτε πόλεώς τε τῆς μεγίστης ἡσσᾶσθαι μέτρια προκαλουμένης , ξυμμάχους γενέσθαι ἔχοντας τὴν ὑμετέραν αὐτῶν ὑποτελεῖς , καὶ δοθείσης αἱρέσεως πολέμου πέρι καὶ ἀσφαλείας μὴ τὰ χείρω φιλονικῆσαι ·
"Against this then you, if you take good advice, will be on your guard; and will not consider it discreditable to submit to the most powerful state, when it offers you fair terms, namely, that you should become tributary allies, with the enjoyment of your own country; and when a choice of war or safety is given you, to avoid choosing through animosity what is worse for you.


5.111.4
4037
ὡς οἵτινες τοῖς μὲν ἴσοις μὴ εἴκουσι , τοῖς δὲ κρείσσοσι καλῶς προσφέρονται , πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ἥσσους μέτριοί εἰσι , πλεῖστ’ ἂν ὀρθοῖντο .
For whatever men do not yield to their equals, while they keep on good terms with their superiors, and are moderate to their inferiors, they would be most successful."


5.111.5
4038
σκοπεῖτε οὖν καὶ μεταστάντων ἡμῶν καὶ ἐνθυμεῖσθε πολλάκις ὅτι περὶ πατρίδος βουλεύεσθε , ἧς μιᾶς πέρι καὶ ἐς μίαν βουλὴν τυχοῦσάν τε καὶ μὴ κατορθώσασαν ἔσται .
" Consider then, even after we have retired; and reflect again and again, that it is for your country that you are consulting, which you can do but for one country, and for once, whether it prove successful or unsuccessful."


5.112.1
4039
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι μετεχώρησαν ἐκ τῶν λόγων ·
So the Athenians retired from the conference;


5.112.1
4040
οἱ δὲ Μήλιοι κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς γενόμενοι , ὡς ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς παραπλήσια καὶ ἀντέλεγον , ἀπεκρίναντο τάδε .
and the Melians, having been left to themselves, as they still thought pretty nearly the same as they had maintained in the discussion, gave the following answer:


5.112.2
4041
&quot; οὔτε ἄλλα δοκεῖ ἡμῖν ἢ ἅπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , οὔτ’ ἐν ὀλίγῳ χρόνῳ πόλεως ἑπτακόσια ἔτη ἤδη οἰκουμένης τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἀφαιρησόμεθα , ἀλλὰ τῇ τε μέχρι τοῦδε σῳζούσῃ τύχῃ ἐκ τοῦ θείου αὐτὴν καὶ τῇ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων τιμωρίᾳ πιστεύοντες πειρασόμεθα σῴζεσθαι .
" We neither think differently from what we did at first, Athenians, nor will we in a short space of time rob of its liberty a city which has now been inhabited seven hundred years; but trusting to the fortune which, by the favour of heaven, has hitherto preserved it, and to the help of man, especially of the Lacedaemonians, we will endeavour to save ourselves."


5.112.3
4042
προκαλούμεθα δὲ ὑμᾶς φίλοι μὲν εἶναι , πολέμιοι δὲ μηδετέροις , καὶ ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἡμῶν ἀναχωρῆσαι σπονδὰς ποιησαμένους αἵτινες δοκοῦσιν ἐπιτήδειοι εἶναι ἀμφοτέροις &quot; .
" But we propose to you that we should be your friends, and the enemies of neither party; and that you should retire from our country after making such a treaty as may appear suitable for both sides."


5.113.1
4043
οἱ μὲν δὴ Μήλιοι τοσαῦτα ἀπεκρίναντο ·
Such then was the answer which the Melians gave.


5.113.1
4044
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι διαλυόμενοι ἤδη ἐκ τῶν λόγων ἔφασαν &quot; ἀλλ’ οὖν μόνοι γε ἀπὸ τούτων τῶν βουλευμάτων , ὡς ἡμῖν δοκεῖτε , τὰ μὲν μέλλοντα τῶν ὁρωμένων σαφέστερα κρίνετε , τὰ δὲ ἀφανῆ τῷ βούλεσθαι ὡς γιγνόμενα ἤδη θεᾶσθε , καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τύχῃ καὶ ἐλπίσι πλεῖστον δὴ παραβεβλημένοι καὶ πιστεύσαντες πλεῖστον καὶ σφαλήσεσθε &quot; .
The Athenians, now departing from the conference, said: "Well then you are the only men who by these counsels, as appears to us, consider what is future as more certain than what is seen, and regard what is out of sight as already occurring, because you wish it; and having staked and relied most on [such things as] Lacedaemonians, and fortune, and hopes, you will also be most disappointed."


5.114.1
4045
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναίων πρέσβεις ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὸ στράτευμα ·
So the Athenian ambassadors returned to their forces:


5.114.1
4046
οἱ δὲ στρατηγοὶ αὐτῶν , ὡς οὐδὲν ὑπήκουον οἱ Μήλιοι , πρὸς πόλεμον εὐθὺς ἐτρέποντο καὶ διελόμενοι κατὰ πόλεις περιετείχισαν κύκλῳ τοὺς Μηλίους .
and their generals, since the Melians did not listen at all to their proposals, immediately proceeded to apply themselves to war; and having divided the work between the different states, enclosed the Melians with lines on all sides.


5.114.2
4047
καὶ ὕστερον φυλακὴν σφῶν τε αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων καταλιπόντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν ἀνεχώρησαν τῷ πλέονι τοῦ στρατοῦ .
Afterwards, the Athenians left a part of their own troops and the allies, to keep guard both by land and sea, and returned with the main body of the forces.


5.114.2
4048
οἱ δὲ λειπόμενοι παραμένοντες ἐπολιόρκουν τὸ χωρίον .
Those who were left behind remained and besieged the place.


5.115.1
4049
καὶ Ἀργεῖοι κατὰ τὸν χρόνον τὸν αὐτὸν ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τὴν Φλειασίαν καὶ λοχισθέντες ὑπό τε Φλειασίων καὶ τῶν σφετέρων φυγάδων διεφθάρησαν ὡς ὀγδοήκοντα .
About the same time an Argive force invaded the Phliasian territory, and being intercepted by an ambuscade of the Phliasians and their allies, were cut off to the number of eighty.


5.115.2
4050
καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Πύλου Ἀθηναῖοι Λακεδαιμονίων πολλὴν λείαν ἔλαβον ·
And now the Athenians at Pylus took great spoils from the Lacedaemonians;


5.115.2
4051
καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι δι’ αὐτὸ τὰς μὲν σπονδὰς οὐδ’ ὣς ἀφέντες ἐπολέμουν αὐτοῖς , ἐκήρυξαν δὲ εἴ τις βούλεται παρὰ σφῶν Ἀθηναίους λῄζεσθαι .
in consequence of which the Lacedaemonians, though even then they did not renounce the treaty, and go to war with them, proclaimed that any of their people who pleased might plunder the Athenians.


5.115.3
4052
καὶ Κορίνθιοι ἐπολέμησαν ἰδίων τινῶν διαφορῶν ἕνεκα τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ·
Moreover, the Corinthians proceeded to hostilities with the Athenians for some private quarrels of their own;


5.115.3
4053
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι Πελοποννήσιοι ἡσύχαζον .
but the rest of the Peloponnesians remained quiet.


5.115.4
4054
εἷλον δὲ καὶ οἱ Μήλιοι τῶν Ἀθηναίων τοῦ περιτειχίσματος τὸ κατὰ τὴν ἀγορὰν προσβαλόντες νυκτός , καὶ ἄνδρας τε ἀπέκτειναν καὶ ἐσενεγκάμενοι σῖτόν τε καὶ ὅσα πλεῖστα ἐδύναντο χρήσιμα ἀναχωρήσαντες ἡσύχαζον ·
The Melians, too, attacked by night the part of the Athenian lines opposite the market-place, and slew some of the men; and having carried in corn, and as many useful things as they could, returned and kept quiet;


5.115.4
4055
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἄμεινον τὴν φυλακὴν τὸ ἔπειτα παρεσκευάζοντο .
while the Athenians made better provision for the guard in future.


5.115.4
4056
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And so the summer ended.


5.116.1
4057
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος Λακεδαιμόνιοι μελλήσαντες ἐς τὴν Ἀργείαν στρατεύειν , ὡς αὐτοῖς τὰ διαβατήρια ἱερὰ ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις οὐκ ἐγίγνετο , ἀνεχώρησαν .
The following winter, the Lacedaemonians intended to march against the Argive territory, but returned on finding, when at the frontier, that the sacrifices for crossing it were not favourable.


5.116.1
4058
καὶ Ἀργεῖοι διὰ τὴν ἐκείνων μέλλησιν τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει τινὰς ὑποπτεύσαντες τοὺς μὲν ξυνέλαβον , οἱ δ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ διέφυγον .
Owing to this intention on their part, the Argives, suspecting a certain party in their city, seized some of them, while others escaped them.


5.116.2
4059
καὶ οἱ Μήλιοι περὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους αὖθις καθ’ ἕτερόν τι τοῦ περιτειχίσματος εἷλον τῶν Ἀθηναίων , παρόντων οὐ πολλῶν τῶν φυλάκων .
About the same time, the Melians again took a part of the Athenian lines in another direction, the garrison not being numerous.


5.116.3
4060
καὶ ἐλθούσης στρατιᾶς ὕστερον ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ἄλλης , ὡς ταῦτα ἐγίγνετο , ἧς ἦρχε Φιλοκράτης ὁ Δημέου , καὶ κατὰ κράτος ἤδη πολιορκούμενοι , γενομένης καὶ προδοσίας τινός , ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν ξυνεχώρησαν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ὥστε ἐκείνους περὶ αὐτῶν βουλεῦσαι .
A fresh force having afterwards come from Athens in consequence of these occurrences, under the command of Philocrates son of Demeas, and the inhabitants being now vigorously blockaded, after there had also been some treachery practised by their own men, they surrendered at discretion to the Athenians;


5.116.4
4061
οἱ δὲ ἀπέκτειναν Μηλίων ὅσους ἡβῶντας ἔλαβον , παῖδας δὲ καὶ γυναῖκας ἠνδραπόδισαν ·
who put to death all the Melian adults they took, and made slaves of the children and women.


5.116.4
4062
τὸ δὲ χωρίον αὐτοὶ ᾤκισαν , ἀποίκους ὕστερον πεντακοσίους πέμψαντες .
As for the country, they afterwards sent out five hundred colonists, and inhabited it themselves.



6.1.1
4063
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος Ἀθηναῖοι ἐβούλοντο αὖθις μείζονι παρασκευῇ τῆς μετὰ Λάχητος καὶ Εὐρυμέδοντος ἐπὶ Σικελίαν πλεύσαντες καταστρέψασθαι , εἰ δύναιντο , ἄπειροι οἱ πολλοὶ ὄντες τοῦ μεγέθους τῆς νήσου καὶ τῶν ἐνοικούντων τοῦ πλήθους καὶ Ἑλλήνων καὶ βαρβάρων , καὶ ὅτι οὐ πολλῷ τινὶ ὑποδεέστερον πόλεμον ἀνῃροῦντο ἢ τὸν πρὸς Πελοποννησίους .
THE same winter the Athenians wished to sail again to Sicily, with a larger armament than that under Laches and Eurymedon, and bring it into subjection to them, if they could; the mass of the people being ignorant of the size of the island, and the number of its inhabitants, both Greeks and barbarians; and that they were undertaking a war not much inferior in magnitude to that with the Peloponnesians.


6.1.2
4064
Σικελίας γὰρ περίπλους μέν ἐστιν ὁλκάδι οὐ πολλῷ τινὶ ἔλασσον ἢ ὀκτὼ ἡμερῶν , καὶ τοσαύτη οὖσα ἐν εἰκοσισταδίῳ μάλιστα μέτρῳ τῆς θαλάσσης διείργεται τὸ μὴ ἤπειρος εἶναι ·
For the voyage round Sicily in a merchant vessel is one of not much less than eight days; and though it is of such extent, it is only excluded by the space of about twenty stades of sea from being mainland.


6.2.1
4065
ᾠκίσθη δὲ ὧδε τὸ ἀρχαῖον , καὶ τοσάδε ἔθνη ἔσχε τὰ ξύμπαντα .
Now it was settled originally in the following manner, and these were all the nations that occupied it.


6.2.1
4066
παλαίτατοι μὲν λέγονται ἐν μέρει τινὶ τῆς χώρας Κύκλωπες καὶ Λαιστρυγόνες οἰκῆσαι , ὧν ἐγὼ οὔτε γένος ἔχω εἰπεῖν οὔτε ὁπόθεν ἐσῆλθον ἢ ὅποι ἀπεχώρησαν ·
The earliest people said to have lived in any part of the country are the Cyclopes and Laestrygones; with regard to whom, I can neither tell their race, nor whence they came into it, nor whither they departed out of it:


6.2.1
4067
ἀρκείτω δὲ ὡς ποιηταῖς τε εἴρηται καὶ ὡς ἕκαστός πῃ γιγνώσκει περὶ αὐτῶν .
but let that suffice which has been said by the poets, and which everybody in any way knows of them.


6.2.2
4068
Σικανοὶ δὲ μετ’ αὐτοὺς πρῶτοι φαίνονται ἐνοικισάμενοι , ὡς μὲν αὐτοί φασι , καὶ πρότεροι διὰ τὸ αὐτόχθονες εἶναι , ὡς δὲ ἡ ἀλήθεια εὑρίσκεται , Ἴβηρες ὄντες καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Σικανοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ἰβηρίᾳ ὑπὸ Λιγύων ἀναστάντες .
The Sicanians appear to have been the first who settled in it after them; indeed, as they themselves assert, even before them, as being the aboriginal population;


6.2.2
4069
καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν Σικανία τότε ἡ νῆσος ἐκαλεῖτο , πρότερον Τρινακρία καλουμένη ·
but as the truth is found to be, they were Iberians, and were driven from the river Sicanus, in Theria, by the Ligurians.


6.2.2
4070
οἰκοῦσι δὲ ἔτι καὶ νῦν τὰ πρὸς ἑσπέραν τὴν Σικελίαν .
And it was from them that the island was at that time called Sicania, having previously been called Trinacria; and still, even to this day, they inhabit Sicily in its western districts.


6.2.3
4071
Ἰλίου δὲ ἁλισκομένου τῶν Τρώων τινὲς διαφυγόντες Ἀχαιοὺς πλοίοις ἀφικνοῦνται πρὸς τὴν Σικελίαν , καὶ ὅμοροι τοῖς Σικανοῖς οἰκήσαντες ξύμπαντες μὲν Ἔλυμοι ἐκλήθησαν , πόλεις δ’ αὐτῶν Ἔρυξ τε καὶ Ἔγεστα .
But on the capture of Troy, some of the Trojans, having escaped the Greeks, came in vessels to Sicily, and having settled in the neighbourhood of the Sicanians, they were all together called Elymi, and their cities, Eryx and Segesta.


6.2.3
4072
προσξυνῴκησαν δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ Φωκέων τινὲς τῶν ἀπὸ Τροίας τότε χειμῶνι ἐς Λιβύην πρῶτον , ἔπειτα ἐς Σικελίαν ἀπ’ αὐτῆς κατενεχθέντες .
There were also settled with them some of the Phocians, who, while returning from Troy, were carried by a tempest, first to Libya, and then from that country to Sicily.


6.2.4
4073
Σικελοὶ δ’ ἐξ Ἰταλίας ( ἐνταῦθα γὰρ ᾤκουν ) διέβησαν ἐς Σικελίαν , φεύγοντες Ὀπικούς , ὡς μὲν εἰκὸς καὶ λέγεται , ἐπὶ σχεδιῶν , τηρήσαντες τὸν πορθμὸν κατιόντος τοῦ ἀνέμου , τάχα ἂν δὲ καὶ ἄλλως πως ἐσπλεύσαντες .
The Sicels, again, went over into Sicily from Italy, (for it was there that they used to live,) while flying from some Opicans; crossing on rafts, (as is probable, and reported to have been the case,) having watched an opportunity for the passage, when the wind set down the strait; or, perhaps, having sailed to it in some other way.


6.2.4
4074
εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ νῦν ἔτι ἐν τῇ Ἰταλίᾳ Σικελοί , καὶ ἡ χώρα ἀπὸ Ἰταλοῦ βασιλέως τινὸς Σικελῶν , τ- ὄνομα τοῦτο ἔχοντος , οὕτως Ἰταλία ἐπωνομάσθη .
Even to this day there are still Sicels in Italy; and it was in this way that the country was called Italy, after Italus, a king of the Sicels who had that name.


6.2.5
4075
ἐλθόντες δὲ ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν στρατὸς πολὺς τούς τε Σικανοὺς κρατοῦντες μάχῃ ἀνέστειλαν πρὸς τὰ μεσημβρινὰ καὶ ἑσπέρια αὐτῆς καὶ ἀντὶ Σικανίας Σικελίαν τὴν νῆσον ἐποίησαν καλεῖσθαι , καὶ τὰ κράτιστα τῆς γῆς ᾤκησαν ἔχοντες , ἐπεὶ διέβησαν , ἔτη ἐγγὺς τριακόσια πρὶν Ἕλληνας ἐς Σικελίαν ἐλθεῖν ·
Having gone, then, to Sicily with a great host, and being victorious in battle over the Sicanians, they compelled them to remove to the southern and western parts of it, and caused the island to be called Sicily, instead of Sicania, and occupied the best parts of the land; having held them, after they crossed over, nearly three hundred years before any Greeks came into Sicily;


6.2.5
4076
ἔτι δὲ καὶ νῦν τὰ μέσα καὶ τὰ πρὸς βορρᾶν τῆς νήσου ἔχουσιν .
and still, even to this day, they retain the central and northern parts of the island.


6.2.6
4077
ᾤκουν δὲ καὶ Φοίνικες περὶ πᾶσαν μὲν τὴν Σικελίαν ἄκρας τε ἐπὶ τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἀπολαβόντες καὶ τὰ ἐπικείμενα νησίδια ἐμπορίας ἕνεκεν τῆς πρὸς τοὺς Σικελούς ·
There were also Phoenicians living around the whole of Sicily, having occupied promontories on the sea-coast, and the small islands adjacent, for purposes of trading with the Sicels:


6.2.6
4078
ἐπειδὴ δὲ οἱ Ἕλληνες πολλοὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν ἐπεσέπλεον , ἐκλιπόντες τὰ πλείω Μοτύην καὶ Σολόεντα καὶ Πάνορμον ἐγγὺς τῶν Ἐλύμων ξυνοικήσαντες ἐνέμοντο , ξυμμαχίᾳ τε πίσυνοι τῇ τῶν Ἐλύμων , καὶ ὅτι ἐντεῦθεν ἐλάχιστον πλοῦν Καρχηδὼν Σικελίας ἀπέχει .
but after the Greeks sailed to it in great numbers by sea, in addition to those already there, they evacuated the greater part of them, and lived in Motya, Solois, and Panormus, near the Elymi, having united with them, both from confidence in their alliance, and because from that quarter the voyage from Sicily to Carthage is shortest.


6.2.6
4079
βάρβαροι μὲν οὖν τοσοίδε Σικελίαν καὶ οὕτως ᾤκησαν .
As regards barbarians, then, so many of them were there that inhabited Sicily, and in such a manner.


6.3.1
4080
Ἑλλήνων δὲ πρῶτοι Χαλκιδῆς ἐξ Εὐβοίας πλεύσαντες μετὰ Θουκλέους οἰκιστοῦ Νάξον ᾤκισαν , καὶ Ἀπόλλωνος Ἀρχηγέτου βωμὸν ὅστις νῦν ἔξω τῆς πόλεώς ἐστιν ἱδρύσαντο , ἐφ’ ᾧ , ὅταν ἐκ Σικελίας θεωροὶ πλέωσι , πρῶτον θύουσιν .
Of the Greeks, on the other hand, some Chalcidians of Euboea first sailed with Thucles as the leader of the colony, and founded Naxos, and built the altar to Apollo Archegetes, which is now outside the city, and on which when any deputies to the games sail from Sicily, they first sacrifice.


6.3.2
4081
Συρακούσας δὲ τοῦ ἐχομένου ἔτους Ἀρχίας τῶν Ἡρακλειδῶν ἐκ Κορίνθου ᾤκισε , Σικελοὺς ἐξελάσας πρῶτον ἐκ τῆς νήσου ἐν ᾗ νῦν οὐκέτι περικλυζομένῃ ἡ πόλις ἡ ἐντός ἐστιν ·
Syracuse was founded the next year by Archias, of the family of Hercules at Corinth, after he had first expelled the Sicels from the island; on which, being no longer surrounded with water, the inner city now stands;


6.3.2
4082
ὕστερον δὲ χρόνῳ καὶ ἡ ἔξω προστειχισθεῖσα πολυάνθρωπος ἐγένετο .
and at a later period the outer one also was enclosed within the wall, and became populous.


6.3.3
4083
Θουκλῆς δὲ καὶ οἱ Χαλκιδῆς ἐκ Νάξου ὁρμηθέντες ἔτει πέμπτῳ μετὰ Συρακούσας οἰκισθείσας Λεοντίνους τε πολέμῳ τοὺς Σικελοὺς ἐξελάσαντες οἰκίζουσι , καὶ μετ’ αὐτοὺς Κατάνην ·
Moreover, Thucles and the Chalcidians from Naxos set out in the fifth year after the founding of Syracuse, and having expelled the Sicels by arms, re—settled Leontini, and after it Catana.


6.3.3
4084
οἰκιστὴν δὲ αὐτοὶ Καταναῖοι ἐποιήσαντο Εὔαρχον .
The Catanians themselves chose Evarchus as their founder.

4085
κατὰ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον καὶ Λάμις ἐκ Μεγάρων ἀποικίαν ἄγων ἐς Σικελίαν ἀφίκετο , καὶ ὑπὲρ Παντακύου τε ποταμοῦ Τρώτιλόν τι ὄνομα χωρίον οἰκίσας , καὶ ὕστερον αὐτόθεν τοῖς Χαλκιδεῦσιν ἐς Λεοντίνους ὀλίγον χρόνον ξυμπολιτεύσας καὶ ὑπὸ αὐτῶν ἐκπεσὼν καὶ Θάψον οἰκίσας αὐτὸς μὲν ἀποθνῄσκει , οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἐκ τῆς Θάψου ἀναστάντες Ὕβλωνος βασιλέως Σικελοῦ προδόντος τὴν χώραν καὶ καθηγησαμένου Μεγαρέας ᾤκισαν τοὺς Ὑβλαίους κληθέντας .
At the same time Lamis arrived in Sicily with a colony from Megara, and after settling in a place beyond the river Pantacyas, Trotilus by name, and subsequently removing thence, and uniting for a short time with the Chalcidians at Leontini, and being driven out by them, he founded Thapsus, and then he himself died; while the rest, being expelled from Thapsus, effected a settlement at Megara, called the Hyblaean, Hyblo, a Sicel king, having given up the place to them and led them in.


6.4.2
4086
καὶ ἔτη οἰκήσαντες πέντε καὶ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ διακόσια ὑπὸ Γέλωνος τυράννου Συρακοσίων ἀνέστησαν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ χώρας .
After inhabiting it two hundred and forty—five years, they were expelled from the city and country by Gelo, tyrant of Syracuse.


6.4.2
4087
πρὶν δὲ ἀναστῆναι , ἔτεσιν ὕστερον ἑκατὸν ἢ αὐτοὺς οἰκίσαι , Πάμιλλον πέμψαντες Σελινοῦντα κτίζουσι , καὶ ἐκ Μεγάρων τῆς μητροπόλεως οὔσης αὐτοῖς ἐπελθὼν ξυγκατῴκισεν .
Before their expulsion, however, a hundred years after their settlement, they founded Seliaus, having sent Pamillus for the purpose, who came from Megara, their mother—city, and joined them in founding it.


6.4.3
4088
Γέλαν δὲ Ἀντίφημος ἐκ Ῥόδου καὶ Ἔντιμος ἐκ Κρήτης ἐποίκους ἀγαγόντες κοινῇ ἔκτισαν , ἔτει πέμπτῳ καὶ τεσσαρακοστῷ μετὰ Συρακουσῶν οἴκισιν .
Gela, again, was founded by Antiphemus from Rhodes, and Entimus from Crete, who led a common colony, in the forty-fifth year after the founding of Syracuse.


6.4.3
4089
καὶ τῇ μὲν πόλει ἀπὸ τοῦ Γέλα ποταμοῦ τ- ὄνομα ἐγένετο , τὸ δὲ χωρίον οὗ νῦν ἡ πόλις ἐστὶ καὶ ὃ πρῶτον ἐτειχίσθη Λίνδιοι καλεῖται ·
The name of the city was taken from the river Gelas, but the spot where " the city," [properly so called,] now stands, and which was first fortified, is named Lindii.


6.4.3
4090
νόμιμα δὲ Δωρικὰ ἐτέθη αὐτοῖς .
The institutions established amongst them were Dorian.


6.4.4
4091
ἔτεσι δὲ ἐγγύτατα ὀκτὼ καὶ ἑκατὸν μετὰ τὴν σφετέραν οἴκισιν Γελῷοι Ἀκράγαντα ᾤκισαν , τὴν μὲν πόλιν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀκράγαντος ποταμοῦ ὀνομάσαντες , οἰκιστὰς δὲ ποιήσαντες Ἀριστόνουν καὶ Πυστίλον , νόμιμα δὲ τὰ Γελῴων δόντες .
Just about a hundred and eight years after their own settlement, the Geloans settled Acragas, [or Agrigentum,] naming the city from the river Acragas: they made Aristonous and Pystilus the leaders of their colony, and gave it the institutions of the Geloans.


6.4.5
4092
Ζάγκλη δὲ τὴν μὲν ἀρχὴν ἀπὸ Κύμης τῆς ἐν Ὀπικίᾳ Χαλκιδικῆς πόλεως λῃστῶν ἀφικομένων ᾠκίσθη , ὕστερον δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ Χαλκίδος καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Εὐβοίας πλῆθος ἐλθὸν ξυγκατενείμαντο τὴν γῆν ·
Zancle, again, was originally founded from Cuma, the Chalcidian city in the country of the Opici, by some freebooters who went there; but afterwards a great number went from Chalcis and the rest of Euboea, and shared with them in the occupation of the land;


6.4.5
4093
καὶ οἰκισταὶ Περιήρης καὶ Κραταιμένης ἐγένοντο αὐτῆς , ὁ μὲν ἀπὸ Κύμης , ὁ δὲ ἀπὸ Χαλκίδος .
its founders being Perieres and Crataemenes, one from Cuma, the other from Chalcis.


6.4.5
4094
ὄνομα δὲ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον Ζάγκλη ἦν ὑπὸ τῶν Σικελῶν κληθεῖσα , ὅτι δρεπανοειδὲς τὴν ἰδέαν τὸ χωρίον ἐστί ( τὸ δὲ δρέπανον οἱ Σικελοὶ ζάγκλον καλοῦσιν ) , ὕστερον δ’ αὐτοὶ μὲν ὑπὸ Σαμίων καὶ ἄλλων Ἰώνων ἐκπίπτουσιν , οἳ Μήδους φεύγοντες προσέβαλον Σικελίᾳ , τοὺς δὲ Σαμίους Ἀναξίλας Ῥηγίνων τύραννος οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον ἐκβαλὼν καὶ τὴν πόλιν αὐτὸς ξυμμείκτων ἀνθρώπων οἰκίσας Μεσσήνην ἀπὸ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ τὸ ἀρχαῖον πατρίδος ἀντωνόμασεν .
As regards its name, it was at first called Zancle by the Sicels, because the site resembles a reaping-hook in figure, and the reaping-hook is called by the Sicels Afterwards, these settlers were expelled by some Samians and other Ionians, who landed in Sicily while flying from the Medes;


6.5.1
4095
καὶ Ἱμέρα ἀπὸ Ζάγκλης ᾠκίσθη ὑπὸ Εὐκλείδου καὶ Σίμου καὶ Σάκωνος , καὶ Χαλκιδῆς μὲν οἱ πλεῖστοι ἦλθον ἐς τὴν ἀποικίαν , ξυνῴκισαν δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐκ Συρακουσῶν φυγάδες στάσει νικηθέντες , οἱ Μυλητίδαι καλούμενοι ·
Himera was founded from Zancle by Euclides, Simus, and Saco, and most of those who went to the colony were Chalcidians, though there were also united with them some exiles from Syracuse, who had been defeated in a strife of factions—the Mylaetidae, as they are called.


6.5.1
4096
καὶ φωνὴ μὲν μεταξὺ τῆς τε Χαλκιδέων καὶ Δωρίδος ἐκράθη , νόμιμα δὲ τὰ Χαλκιδικὰ ἐκράτησεν .
The language was a mixture of the Chalcidian and Dorian; but the Chalcidian were the prevailing institutions.


6.5.2
4097
Ἄκραι δὲ καὶ Κασμέναι ὑπὸ Συρακοσίων ᾠκίσθησαν , Ἄκραι μὲν ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτεσι μετὰ Συρακούσας , Κασμέναι δ’ ἐγγὺς εἴκοσι μετὰ Ἄκρας .
Acrae and Casmenae were founded by the Syracusans; Acrae seventy years after Syracuse, and Casmenae nearly twenty years after Acrae.


6.5.3
4098
καὶ Καμάρινα τὸ πρῶτον ὑπὸ Συρακοσίων ᾠκίσθη , ἔτεσιν ἐγγύτατα πέντε καὶ τριάκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν μετὰ Συρακουσῶν κτίσιν ·
Camarina was in the first instance founded by the Syracusans, just about a hundred and thirty-five years after the building of Syracuse.


6.5.3
4099
οἰκισταὶ δὲ ἐγένοντο αὐτῆς Δάσκων καὶ Μενέκωλος .
Its founders were Dascon and Menecolus.


6.5.3
4100
ἀναστάτων δὲ Καμαριναίων γενομένων πολέμῳ ὑπὸ Συρακοσίων δι’ ἀπόστασιν , χρόνῳ Ἱπποκράτης ὕστερον Γέλας τύραννος , λύτρα ἀνδρῶν Συρακοσίων αἰχμαλώτων λαβὼν τὴν γῆν τὴν Καμαριναίων , αὐτὸς οἰκιστὴς γενόμενος κατῴκισε Καμάριναν .
But the Camarinaeans having been driven out after a war by the Syracusans on account of their revolting from them, some time after, Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, having received their territory as a ransom for some Syracusan prisoners, himself acting as founder, re-settled Camarina.


6.5.3
4101
καὶ αὖθις ὑπὸ Γέλωνος ἀνάστατος γενομένη τὸ τρίτον κατῳκίσθη ὑπὸ Γελῴων .
And having again been depopulated by Gelo, it was settled for the third time by the Geloans.


6.6.1
4102
τοσαῦτα ἔθνη Ἑλλήνων καὶ βαρβάρων Σικελίαν ᾤκει ,καὶ ἐπὶ τοσήνδε οὖσαν αὐτὴν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι στρατεύειν ὥρμηντο , ἐφιέμενοι μὲν τῇ ἀληθεστάτῃ προφάσει τῆς πάσης ἄρξαι , βοηθεῖν δὲ ἅμα εὐπρεπῶς βουλόμενοι τοῖς ἑαυτῶν ξυγγενέσι καὶ τοῖς προσγεγενημένοις ξυμμάχοις .
So many were the nations of Greeks and barbarians that inhabited Sicily, and such was the size of the island against which the Athenians were eager to make an expedition; being desirous (to mention their truest motive) of gaining dominion over the whole of it; but at the same time wishing, as a plausible pretext, to succour their own kinsmen, and the allies they had gained besides.


6.6.2
4103
μάλιστα δ’ αὐτοὺς ἐξώρμησαν Ἐγεσταίων τε πρέσβεις παρόντες καὶ προθυμότερον ἐπικαλούμενοι .
Above all, they were instigated by ambassadors from the Segestans, who had come to Athens and invoked their aid more earnestly than ever.


6.6.2
4104
ὅμοροι γὰρ ὄντες τοῖς Σελινουντίοις ἐς πόλεμον καθέστασαν περί τε γαμικῶν τινῶν καὶ περὶ γῆς ἀμφισβητήτου , καὶ οἱ Σελινούντιοι Συρακοσίους ἐπαγόμενοι ξυμμάχους κατεῖργον αὐτοὺς τῷ πολέμῳ καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν ·
For being borderers of the Selinuntines, they had gone to war with them on certain questions respecting marriage rights, and for some debated territory; and the Selinuntines, having taken the Syracusans for their allies, were pressing them hard with hostilities both by land and sea.


6.6.2
4105
ὥστε τὴν γενομένην ἐπὶ Λάχητος καὶ τοῦ προτέρου πολέμου Λεοντίνων οἱ Ἐγεσταῖοι ξυμμαχίαν ἀναμιμνῄσκοντες τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐδέοντο σφίσι ναῦς πέμψαντας ἐπαμῦναι , λέγοντες ἄλλα τε πολλὰ καὶ κεφάλαιον , εἰ Συρακόσιοι Λεοντίνους τε ἀναστήσαντες ἀτιμώρητοι γενήσονται καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς ἔτι ξυμμάχους αὐτῶν διαφθείροντες αὐτοὶ τὴν ἅπασαν δύναμιν τῆς Σικελίας σχήσουσι , κίνδυνον εἶναι μή ποτε μεγάλῃ παρασκευῇ Δωριῆς τε Δωριεῦσι κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς καὶ ἅμα ἄποικοι τοῖς ἐκπέμψασι Πελοποννησίοις βοηθήσαντες καὶ τὴν ἐκείνων δύναμιν ξυγκαθέλωσιν ·
Consequently the Segestans reminded the Athenians of their alliance, which had been formed in the time of Laches and of the former war with the Leontines, and begged them to send a fleet and assist them; alleging many other things, and, as the sum and substance of all, " that if the Syracusans should be unpunished for the depopulation of Leontini, and, by ruining such of the Athenian allies as were still left should themselves obtain the whole power of Sicily; there would be danger of their some time or other coming with a large force, as Dorians, to the aid of Dorians, on the strength of their connexion, and, moreover, as colonists, to the aid of the Peloponnesians who had sent them out, and so joining in the destruction of the Athenian power.


6.6.2
4106
σῶφρον δ’ εἶναι μετὰ τῶν ὑπολοίπων ἔτι ξυμμάχων ἀντέχειν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις , ἄλλως τε καὶ χρήματα σφῶν παρεξόντων ἐς τὸν πόλεμον ἱκανά .
It were wise therefore, in concert with the remaining allies, to resist the Syracusans;


6.6.3
4107
ὧν ἀκούοντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τῶν τε Ἐγεσταίων πολλάκις λεγόντων καὶ τῶν ξυναγορευόντων αὐτοῖς ἐψηφίσαντο πρέσβεις πέμψαι πρῶτον ἐς τὴν Ἔγεσταν περί τε τῶν χρημάτων σκεψομένους εἰ ὑπάρχει , ὥσπερ φασίν , ἐν τῷ κοινῷ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς , καὶ τὰ τοῦ πολέμου ἅμα πρὸς τοὺς Σελινουντίους ἐν ὅτῳ ἐστὶν εἰσομένους .
" especially as they would themselves furnish money sufficient for the war."  The Athenians, hearing these things in their assemblies from the Segestans and their supporters, who were repeatedly alleging them, passed a decree on the subject; sending ambassadors, in the first place, to see about the money, whether it were already laid up, as they asserted, in the treasury and in the temples, and at the same time to ascertain what was the state of the war with the Selinuntines.


6.7.1
4108
καὶ οἱ μὲν πρέσβεις τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπεστάλησαν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν ·
The ambassadors of the Athenians, then, were thus sent to Sicily.


6.7.1
4109
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι πλὴν Κορινθίων στρατεύσαντες ἐς τὴν Ἀργείαν τῆς τε γῆς ἔτεμον οὐ πολλὴν καὶ σῖτον ἀνεκομίσαντό τινα ζεύγη κομίσαντες , καὶ ἐς Ὀρνεὰς κατοικίσαντες τοὺς Ἀργείων φυγάδας καὶ τῆς ἄλλης στρατιᾶς παρακαταλιπόντες αὐτοῖς ὀλίγους , καὶ σπεισάμενοί τινα χρόνον ὥστε μὴ ἀδικεῖν Ὀρνεάτας καὶ Ἀργείους τὴν ἀλλήλων , ἀπεχώρησαν τῷ στρατῷ ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The same winter, the Lacedaemonians and their allies, except the Corinthians, having made an expedition into the Argive territory, ravaged a small part of the land, and took some yokes of oxen, and carried off some corn. They also settled the Argive exiles at Orneae; and having left them a few men from the rest of their forces also, and made a truce for some time, on condition of the Orneatae and the Argives not injuring each other's land, they returned home with their army.


6.7.2
4110
ἐλθόντων δὲ Ἀθηναίων οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον ναυσὶ τριάκοντα καὶ ἑξακοσίοις ὁπλίταις , οἱ Ἀργεῖοι μετὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων πανστρατιᾷ ἐξελθόντες τοὺς μὲν ἐν Ὀρνεαῖς μίαν ἡμέραν ἐπολιόρκουν ·
But the Athenians having come no long time after with thirty ships and six hundred heavy-armed, the Argives, in conjunction with the Athenians, taking the field with all their force, besieged the men in Orneae one day;


6.7.2
4111
ὑπὸ δὲ νύκτα αὐλισαμένου τοῦ στρατεύματος ἄπωθεν ἐκδιδράσκουσιν οἱ ἐκ τῶν Ὀρνεῶν .
but at night, the army having bivouacked at some distance, they escaped out of it.


6.7.2
4112
καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ὡς ᾔσθοντο , κατασκάψαντες τὰς Ὀρνεὰς ἀνεχώρησαν καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὕστερον ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The next day, the Argives, on finding this, razed Orneae and returned, and the Athenians afterwards went home with their ships.


6.7.3
4113
καὶ ἐς Μεθώνην τὴν ὅμορον Μακεδονίᾳ ἱππέας κατὰ θάλασσαν κομίσαντες Ἀθηναῖοι σφῶν τε αὐτῶν καὶ Μακεδόνων τοὺς παρὰ σφίσι φυγάδας ἐκακούργουν τὴν Περδίκκου .
Moreover, the Athenians took by sea some of their own cavalry, and the Macedonian exiles who were with them, to Methone, the country bordering on Macedonia, and ravaged the territory of Perdiccas.


6.7.4
4114
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ πέμψαντες παρὰ Χαλκιδέας τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης , ἄγοντας πρὸς Ἀθηναίους δεχημέρους σπονδάς , ξυμπολεμεῖν ἐκέλευον Περδίκκᾳ ·
The Lacedaemonians therefore sent to the Chalcidians Thrace-ward, who had a truce with the Athenians from one ten days to another, and urged them to join Perdiccas in the war;


6.7.4
4115
οἱ δ’ οὐκ ἤθελον .
but they would not.


6.7.4
4116
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ ἕκτον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος ἐτελεύτα τῷ πολέμῳ τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
And so the winter ended, and the sixteenth year of this war, of which Thucydides wrote the history.


6.8.1
4117
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους ἅμα ἦρι οἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων πρέσβεις ἧκον ἐκ τῆς Σικελίας καὶ οἱ Ἐγεσταῖοι μετ’ αὐτῶν ἄγοντες ἑξήκοντα τάλαντα ἀσήμου ἀργυρίου ὡς ἐς ἑξήκοντα ναῦς μηνὸς μισθόν , ἃς ἔμελλον δεήσεσθαι πέμπειν .
The following summer, as soon as the spring commenced, the ambassadors of the Athenians came from Sicily, and the Segestans with them, bringing sixty talents of uncoined silver, as a month's pay for sixty ships which they were to beg them to send.


6.8.2
4118
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐκκλησίαν ποιήσαντες καὶ ἀκούσαντες τῶν τε Ἐγεσταίων καὶ τῶν σφετέρων πρέσβεων τά τε ἄλλα ἐπαγωγὰ καὶ οὐκ ἀληθῆ καὶ περὶ τῶν χρημάτων ὡς εἴη ἑτοῖμα ἔν τε τοῖς ἱεροῖς πολλὰ καὶ ἐν τῷ κοινῷ , ἐψηφίσαντο ναῦς ἑξήκοντα πέμπειν ἐς Σικελίαν καὶ στρατηγοὺς αὐτοκράτορας Ἀλκιβιάδην τε τὸν Κλεινίου καὶ Νικίαν τὸν Νικηράτου καὶ Λάμαχον τὸν Ξενοφάνους , βοηθοὺς μὲν Ἐγεσταίοις πρὸς Σελινουντίους , ξυγκατοικίσαι δὲ καὶ Λεοντίνους , ἤν τι περιγίγνηται αὐτοῖς τοῦ πολέμου , καὶ τ- ἄλλα τὰ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ πρᾶξαι ὅπῃ ἂν γιγνώσκωσιν ἄριστα Ἀθηναίοις .
And the Athenians having held an assembly, and heard from the Segestans and their own ambassadors a seductive and untrue report on the other subjects, and also, with regard to the money, that it was provided in abundance in the temples and the treasury; they voted to send sixty ships, with Alcibiades son of Clinias, Nicias son of Niceratus, and Lamachus son of Xenophanes, as commanders, with full powers, to assist the Segestans against the Selinuntines, and to join in re-founding Leontini, should they gain any advantage in the war, and to carry out all other measures in Sicily, as they should deem best for the Athenians.—


6.8.3
4119
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἡμέρᾳ πέμπτῃ ἐκκλησία αὖθις ἐγίγνετο , καθ’ ὅτι χρὴ τὴν παρασκευὴν ταῖς ναυσὶ τάχιστα γίγνεσθαι , καὶ τοῖς στρατηγοῖς , εἴ του προσδέοιντο , ψηφισθῆναι ἐς τὸν ἔκπλουν .
On the fifth day after this, an assembly was again held, to consider in what way the preparations for the ships should be most quickly made, and whatever else was wanted by the generals be voted them for the expedition.


6.8.4
4120
καὶ ὁ Νικίας ἀεκούσιος μὲν ᾑρημένος ἄρχειν , νομίζων δὲ τὴν πόλιν οὐκ ὀρθῶς βεβουλεῦσθαι , ἀλλὰ προφάσει βραχείᾳ καὶ εὐπρεπεῖ τῆς Σικελίας ἁπάσης , μεγάλου ἔργου , ἐφίεσθαι , παρελθὼν ἀποτρέψαι ἐβούλετο , καὶ παρῄνει τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τοιάδε .
Nicias then, who had been chosen against his will to take the command, and thought that the state was not well advised, but, on a trifling and specious pretext, was coveting the whole of Sicily—an arduous design to achieve—came forward with a wish to divert the Athenians from it, and advised them to the following effect:


6.9.1
4121
&quot; ἡ μὲν ἐκκλησία περὶ παρασκευῆς τῆς ἡμετέρας ἥδε ξυνελέγη , καθ’ ὅτι χρὴ ἐς Σικελίαν ἐκπλεῖν ·
"This assembly was, it is true, convened to consider the subject of our preparations, namely, in what way we ought to make the expedition to Sicily.


6.9.1
4122
ἐμοὶ μέντοι δοκεῖ καὶ περὶ αὐτοῦ τούτου ἔτι χρῆναι σκέψασθαι , εἰ ἄμεινόν ἐστιν ἐκπέμπειν τὰς ναῦς , καὶ μὴ οὕτω βραχείᾳ βουλῇ περὶ μεγάλων πραγμάτων ἀνδράσιν ἀλλοφύλοις πειθομένους πόλεμον οὐ προσήκοντα ἄρασθαι .
My opinion, however, is, that we ought still to consider this very point, whether it be better to send out our ships: and not on such slight deliberation on matters of great moment, at the instigation of aliens, to take upon ourselves a war, with which we have nothing to do.


6.9.2
4123
καίτοι ἔγωγε καὶ τιμῶμαι ἐκ τοῦ τοιούτου καὶ ἧσσον ἑτέρων περὶ τῷ ἐμαυτοῦ σώματι ὀρρωδῶ , νομίζων ὁμοίως ἀγαθὸν πολίτην εἶναι ὃς ἂν καὶ τοῦ σώματός τι καὶ τῆς οὐσίας προνοῆται ·
And yet I, for my own part, receive honour from such a policy, and have less fear than others for my own personal safety: (though I consider that man to be an equally good citizen who takes some forethought both for his person and his property;


6.9.2
4124
μάλιστα γὰρ ἂν ὁ τοιοῦτος καὶ τὰ τῆς πόλεως δι’ ἑαυτὸν βούλοιτο ὀρθοῦσθαι .
for such a man would, for his own sake, be most desirous that his country also should prosper:)


6.9.2
4125
ὅμως δὲ οὔτε ἐν τῷ πρότερον χρόνῳ διὰ τὸ προτιμᾶσθαι εἶπον παρὰ γνώμην οὔτε νῦν , ἀλλὰ ᾗ ἂν γιγνώσκω βέλτιστα , ἐρῶ .
nevertheless, neither aforetime have I ever spoken contrary to my convictions, for the sake of being honoured above others, nor will I now, but as I think best, so will I speak.


6.9.3
4126
καὶ πρὸς μὲν τοὺς τρόπους τοὺς ὑμετέρους ἀσθενὴς ἄν μου ὁ λόγος εἴη , εἰ τά τε ὑπάρχοντα σῴζειν παραινοίην καὶ μὴ τοῖς ἑτοίμοις περὶ τῶν ἀφανῶν καὶ μελλόντων κινδυνεύειν ·
And though against your inclinations my words would be powerless, should I advise you to keep what you have, and not expose your present possessions to danger for things which are uncertain and future;


6.9.3
4127
ὡς δὲ οὔτε ἐν καιρῷ σπεύδετε οὔτε ῥᾴδιά ἐστι κατασχεῖν ἐφ’ ἃ ὥρμησθε , ταῦτα διδάξω .
yet that neither are you timely in your haste, nor the objects of your ambition easy to attain, on these points I will give you instruction.


6.10.1
4128
&quot; φημὶ γὰρ ὑμᾶς πολεμίους πολλοὺς ἐνθάδε ὑπολιπόντας καὶ ἑτέρους ἐπιθυμεῖν ἐκεῖσε πλεύσαντας δεῦρο ἐπαγαγέσθαι .
"I say then, that you wish, though leaving many enemies behind you here, to bring hither fresh ones besides, by sailing there.


6.10.2
4129
καὶ οἴεσθε ἴσως τὰς γενομένας ὑμῖν σπονδὰς ἔχειν τι βέβαιον , αἳ ἡσυχαζόντων μὲν ὑμῶν ὀνόματι σπονδαὶ ἔσονται ( οὕτω γὰρ ἐνθένδε τε ἄνδρες ἔπραξαν αὐτὰ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐναντίων ) , σφαλέντων δέ που ἀξιόχρεῳ δυνάμει ταχεῖαν τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν ἡμῖν οἱ ἐχθροὶ ποιήσονται , οἷς πρῶτον μὲν διὰ ξυμφορῶν ἡ ξύμβασις καὶ ἐκ τοῦ αἰσχίονος ἢ ἡμῖν κατ’ ἀνάγκην ἐγένετο , ἔπειτα ἐν αὐτῇ ταύτῃ πολλὰ τὰ ἀμφισβητούμενα ἔχομεν .
And you fancy, perhaps, that the treaty that has been made by you affords some ground of confidence. But though, as long as you remain quiet, that will, indeed, be a treaty—in name, (for to this condition have certain persons here and amongst your enemies brought it by their intrigues,) yet if we are ever defeated with any considerable force, those who hate us will quickly make an attack upon us; seeing, in the first place, that the arrangement was made of necessity by them, under circumstances of disaster, and of greater discredit to them than to us; and, secondly, that in this very arrangement we have many subjects open to debate.


6.10.3
4130
εἰσὶ δ’ οἳ οὐδὲ ταύτην πω τὴν ὁμολογίαν ἐδέξαντο , καὶ οὐχ οἱ ἀσθενέστατοι ·
There are some, too, who have not yet acceded even to this composition, such as it is, and those not the least powerful states;


6.10.3
4131
ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν ἄντικρυς πολεμοῦσιν , οἱ δὲ καὶ διὰ τὸ Λακεδαιμονίους ἔτι ἡσυχάζειν δεχημέροις σπονδαῖς καὶ αὐτοὶ κατέχονται .
but some of them are at war with us downright, and, in the case of others, because the Lacedaemonians remain quiet at present, they too are restrained by truces from one ten days to another.


6.10.4
4132
τάχα δ’ ἂν ἴσως , εἰ δίχα ἡμῶν τὴν δύναμιν λάβοιεν , ὅπερ νῦν σπεύδομεν , καὶ πάνυ ἂν ξυνεπιθοῖντο μετὰ Σικελιωτῶν , οὓς πρὸ πολλῶν ἂν ἐτιμήσαντο ξυμμάχους γενέσθαι ἐν τῷ πρὶν χρόνῳ .
But probably, if they should find our power divided, (which we are now so anxious to bring about,) they would with all their might attack us, in conjunction with the Siceliots, whose alliance they would in time past have valued most highly.


6.10.5
4133
ὥστε χρὴ σκοπεῖν τινὰ αὐτὰ καὶ μὴ μετεώρῳ τε τῇ πόλει ἀξιοῦν κινδυνεύειν καὶ ἀρχῆς ἄλλης ὀρέγεσθαι πρὶν ἣν ἔχομεν βεβαιωσώμεθα , εἰ Χαλκιδῆς γε οἱ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ἔτη τοσαῦτα ἀφεστῶτες ἀφ’ ἡμῶν ἔτι ἀχείρωτοί εἰσι καὶ ἄλλοι τινὲς κατὰ τὰς ἠπείρους ἐνδοιαστῶς ἀκροῶνται .
Every one therefore ought to look to this, and not presume to run risks with a state so unsettled, and to grasp at another empire before we have secured the one we have; seeing that the Chalcidians Thrace-ward, though they have revolted from us so many years, are still unsubdued;


6.10.5
4134
ἡμεῖς δὲ Ἐγεσταίοις δὴ οὖσι ξυμμάχοις ὡς ἀδικουμένοις ὀξέως βοηθοῦμεν ·
and there are some others on the different coasts of the mainland who yield us but a doubtful obedience.


6.10.5
4135
ὑφ’ ὧν δ’ αὐτοὶ πάλαι ἀφεστώτων ἀδικούμεθα , ἔτι μέλλομεν ἀμύνεσθαι .
And so we are quick to succour the Segestans, who are our allies, for sooth, as being injured; but on those by whose revolt we have ourselves long ago been injured, we still defer to avenge ourselves.


6.11.1
4136
καίτοι τοὺς μὲν κατεργασάμενοι κἂν κατάσχοιμεν ·
And yet the latter, if subdued, might be kept in subjection by us;


6.11.1
4137
τῶν δ’ εἰ καὶ κρατήσαιμεν , διὰ πολλοῦ γε καὶ πολλῶν ὄντων χαλεπῶς ἂν ἄρχειν δυναίμεθα .
but the former, even if we conquered them, we should hardly be able to govern, so far off and so numerous as they are.


6.11.1
4138
ἀνόητον δ’ ἐπὶ τοιούτους ἰέναι ὧν κρατήσας τε μὴ κατασχήσει τις καὶ μὴ κατορθώσας μὴ ἐν τῷ ὁμοίῳ καὶ πρὶν ἐπιχειρῆσαι ἔσται .
But it is folly to go against men whom we could not keep under, if we conquered them; while, if we did not succeed in the attempt, we should not be in the same position as we were before making it.


6.11.2
4139
Σικελιῶται δ’ ἄν μοι δοκοῦσιν , ὥς γε νῦν ἔχουσι , καὶ ἔτι ἂν ἧσσον δεινοὶ ἡμῖν γενέσθαι , εἰ ἄρξειαν αὐτῶν Συρακόσιοι ·
Again, regarding the present condition of the Siceliots, they appear to me even still less likely to be formidable to us, if the Syracusans should have dominion over them;


6.11.2
4140
ὅπερ οἱ Ἐγεσταῖοι μάλιστα ἡμᾶς ἐκφοβοῦσιν .
that supposition with which the Segestans especially try to frighten us.


6.11.3
4141
νῦν μὲν γὰρ κἂν ἔλθοιεν ἴσως Λακεδαιμονίων ἕκαστοι χάριτι , ἐκείνως δ’ οὐκ εἰκὸς ἀρχὴν ἐπὶ ἀρχὴν στρατεῦσαι ·
For at present they might, perhaps, come hither as separate states, to oblige the Lacedaemonians;


6.11.3
4142
ᾧ γὰρ ἂν τρόπῳ τὴν ἡμετέραν μετὰ Πελοποννησίων ἀφέλωνται , εἰκὸς ὑπὸ τῶν αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν σφετέραν διὰ τοῦ αὐτοῦ καθαιρεθῆναι .
but in the other case, it is not likely that they should undertake the expedition, empire against empire: for in the same manner as they, in conjunction with the Lacedaemonians, had taken away ours, it is probable that they would have their own taken away by the same Peloponnesians, and by the same principle.


6.11.4
4143
ἡμᾶς δ’ ἂν οἱ ἐκεῖ Ἕλληνες μάλιστα μὲν ἐκπεπληγμένοι εἶεν εἰ μὴ ἀφικοίμεθα , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ εἰ δείξαντες τὴν δύναμιν δι’ ὀλίγου ἀπέλθοιμεν ·
And the Greeks in those parts would be most in awe of us, if we did not go there at all;


6.11.4
4144
τὰ γὰρ διὰ πλείστου πάντες ἴσμεν θαυμαζόμενα καὶ τὰ πεῖραν ἥκιστα τῆς δόξης δόντα .
and next to that, if after making a demonstration of our power we retired in a short time: but if we should meet with any reverses they would very quickly despise us, and attack us in concert with our enemies here.


6.11.4
4145
εἰ δὲ σφαλείημέν τι , τάχιστ’ ἂν ὑπεριδόντες μετὰ τῶν ἐνθάδε ἐπιθοῖντο .
For we all know that what is farthest off is most admired, and what gives the least room for having its fame tested.


6.11.5
4146
ὅπερ νῦν ὑμεῖς ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους πεπόνθατε ·
And this has at present been your case, Athenians, with reference to the Lacedaemonians and their allies;


6.11.5
4147
διὰ τὸ παρὰ γνώμην αὐτῶν πρὸς ἃ ἐφοβεῖσθε τὸ πρῶτον περιγεγενῆσθαι , καταφρονήσαντες ἤδη καὶ Σικελίας ἐφίεσθε .
from having, contrary to your expectation, gained the advantage over them, (comparing your present position with the fears you at first entertained,) you have despised them, and are now desiring the conquest of Sicily.


6.11.6
4148
χρὴ δὲ μὴ πρὸς τὰς τύχας τῶν ἐναντίων ἐπαίρεσθαι , ἀλλὰ τὰς διανοίας κρατήσαντας θαρσεῖν , μηδὲ Λακεδαιμονίους ἄλλο τι ἡγήσασθαι ἢ διὰ τὸ αἰσχρὸν σκοπεῖν ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἔτι καὶ νῦν , ἢν δύνωνται , σφήλαντες ἡμᾶς τὸ σφέτερον ἀπρεπὲς εὖ θήσονται , ὅσῳ καὶ περὶ πλείστου καὶ διὰ πλείστου δόξαν ἀρετῆς μελετῶσιν .
You ought not, however, to be elated through the misfortunes of your adversaries, but then only to feel confident when you have mastered their spirits; nor should you think that the Lacedaemonians are doing ought but considering, in consequence of their disgrace, in what way they may even now, if possible, overthrow us, and bring their own discredit to a happy termination; especially as they have studied a reputation for bravery, as a thing of the greatest importance, and for the greatest length of time.


6.11.7
4149
ὥστε οὐ περὶ τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ Ἐγεσταίων ἡμῖν , ἀνδρῶν βαρβάρων , ὁ ἀγών , εἰ σωφρονοῦμεν , ἀλλ’ ὅπως πόλιν δι’ ὀλιγαρχίας ἐπιβουλεύουσαν ὀξέως φυλαξόμεθα .
So that our great struggle will be, if we are wise, not for the Segestans in Sicily, men who are barbarians, but that we may vigorously guard against a state which is plotting against us by the spread of oligarchical principles.


6.12.1
4150
&quot; καὶ μεμνῆσθαι χρὴ ἡμᾶς ὅτι νεωστὶ ἀπὸ νόσου μεγάλης καὶ πολέμου βραχύ τι λελωφήκαμεν , ὥστε καὶ χρήμασι καὶ τοῖς σώμασιν ηὐξῆσθαι ·
"We ought to remember, too, that we have but lately recovered a little from a great pestilence and war, so as to be somewhat recruited both in our property and persons;


6.12.1
4151
καὶ ταῦτα ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν δίκαιον ἐνθάδε εἶναι ἀναλοῦν , καὶ μὴ ὑπὲρ ἀνδρῶν φυγάδων τῶνδε ἐπικουρίας δεομένων , οἷς τό τε ψεύσασθαι καλῶς χρήσιμον καὶ τῷ τοῦ πέλας κινδύνῳ , αὐτοὺς λόγους μόνον παρασχομένους , ἢ κατορθώσαντας χάριν μὴ ἀξίαν εἰδέναι ἢ πταίσαντάς που τοὺς φίλους ξυναπολέσαι .
and that it is but fair for us to expend these here at home, on ourselves, and not on these exiles who are begging your aid; whose interest it is to utter specious falsehoods, and contending at their neighbours' risk, while they themselves only contribute words, either to show no proper gratitude if they succeed, or if in any instance they fail, to ruin their friends along with them.


6.12.2
4152
εἴ τέ τις ἄρχειν ἄσμενος αἱρεθεὶς παραινεῖ ὑμῖν ἐκπλεῖν , τὸ ἑαυτοῦ μόνον σκοπῶν , ἄλλως τε καὶ νεώτερος ὢν ἔτι ἐς τὸ ἄρχειν , ὅπως θαυμασθῇ μὲν ἀπὸ τῆς ἱπποτροφίας , διὰ δὲ πολυτέλειαν καὶ ὠφεληθῇ τι ἐκ τῆς ἀρχῆς , μηδὲ τούτῳ ἐμπαράσχητε τῷ τῆς πόλεως κινδύνῳ ἰδίᾳ ἐλλαμπρύνεσθαι , νομίσατε δὲ τοὺς τοιούτους τὰ μὲν δημόσια ἀδικεῖν , τὰ δὲ ἴδια ἀναλοῦν , καὶ τὸ πρᾶγμα μέγα εἶναι καὶ μὴ οἷον νεωτέρῳ βουλεύσασθαί τε καὶ ὀξέως μεταχειρίσαι .
And if there be any one who is pleased at being appointed to command, and therefore urges you to make the expedition, looking to his own interest alone, (especially as he is yet too young for office,) in order that while he is admired, for his horse-keeping, he may also receive from his appointment some benefit on the score of expense; do not, either, allow that man to exhibit his own individual splendour at the peril of the state; but consider that such men injure the public interests, while they squander their private possessions; and that this is a business of great importance, and not one for a young man to deliberate upon, and rashly to take in hand.


6.13.1
4153
&quot; οὓς ἐγὼ ὁρῶν νῦν ἐνθάδε τῷ αὐτῷ ἀνδρὶ παρακελευστοὺς καθημένους φοβοῦμαι , καὶ τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις ἀντιπαρακελεύομαι μὴ καταισχυνθῆναι , εἴ τῴ τις παρακάθηται τῶνδε , ὅπως μὴ δόξει , ἐὰν μὴ ψηφίζηται πολεμεῖν , μαλακὸς εἶναι , μηδ’ , ὅπερ ἂν αὐτοὶ πάθοιεν , δυσέρωτας εἶναι τῶν ἀπόντων , γνόντας ὅτι ἐπιθυμίᾳ μὲν ἐλάχιστα κατορθοῦνται , προνοίᾳ δὲ πλεῖστα , ἀλλ’ ὑπὲρ τῆς πατρίδος ὡς μέγιστον δὴ τῶν πρὶν κίνδυνον ἀναρριπτούσης ἀντιχειροτονεῖν , καὶ ψηφίζεσθαι τοὺς μὲν Σικελιώτας οἷσπερ νῦν ὅροις χρωμένους πρὸς ἡμᾶς , οὐ μεμπτοῖς , τῷ τε Ἰονίῳ κόλπῳ παρὰ γῆν ἤν τις πλέῃ , καὶ τῷ Σικελικῷ διὰ πελάγους , τὰ αὑτῶν νεμομένους καθ’ αὑτοὺς καὶ ξυμφέρεσθαι ·
"I am alarmed, indeed, when I see such characters sitting here at present by the side of that same individual, in compliance with his bidding; and in return I bid the older men—whichever of them may have one of those characters sitting by him—not to be put down through shame, in order to avoid being thought a coward if he should not vote for going to war; nor, as their opponents themselves might feel, to be madly enamoured of what they do not possess; being convinced that in very few things do men succeed through desire, but in very many through forethought in behalf of their country, as exposing itself to the greatest danger it has ever done, to give their support to the opposite side, and vote that the Siceliots keep the same boundaries with respect to us as at present—boundaries with which no one can find fault—namely, the Ionian Sea, if one sail along shore; and the Sicilian, if one cross the open deep; and that while they enjoy their own possessions, they shall also settle their own quarrels:


6.13.2
4154
τοῖς δ’ Ἐγεσταίοις ἰδίᾳ εἰπεῖν , ἐπειδὴ ἄνευ Ἀθηναίων καὶ ξυνῆψαν πρὸς Σελινουντίους τὸ πρῶτον πόλεμον , μετὰ σφῶν αὐτῶν καὶ καταλύεσθαι ·
and that we tell the Segestans in particular, that since they went to war with the Selinuntines in the first instance without consulting the Athenians, they may also make peace with them by themselves:


6.13.2
4155
καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ξυμμάχους μὴ ποιεῖσθαι ὥσπερ εἰώθαμεν , οἷς κακῶς μὲν πράξασιν ἀμυνοῦμεν , ὠφελίας δ’ αὐτοὶ δεηθέντες οὐ τευξόμεθα .
and that we do not in future make alliance, as we have been accustomed, with men whom we shall assist when they are unfortunate, and when we ask assistance ourselves, shall not obtain it.


6.14.1
4156
&quot; καὶ σύ , ὦ πρύτανι , ταῦτα , εἴπερ ἡγεῖ σοι προσήκειν κήδεσθαί τε τῆς πόλεως καὶ βούλει γενέσθαι πολίτης ἀγαθός , ἐπιψήφιζε καὶ γνώμας προτίθει αὖθις Ἀθηναίοις , νομίσας , εἰ ὀρρωδεῖς τὸ ἀναψηφίσαι , τὸ μὲν λύειν τοὺς νόμους μὴ μετὰ τοσῶνδ’ ἂν μαρτύρων αἰτίαν σχεῖν , τῆς δὲ πόλεως κακῶς βουλευσαμένης ἰατρὸς ἂν γενέσθαι , καὶ τὸ καλῶς ἄρξαι τοῦτ’ εἶναι , ὃς ἂν τὴν πατρίδα ὠφελήσῃ ὡς πλεῖστα ἢ ἑκὼν εἶναι μηδὲν βλάψῃ &quot; .
" And do you, Prytanis, if you think it your duty to care for the state, and if you wish to show yourself a good citizen, put this to the vote, and take a second time the opinion of the Athenians; reflecting, if you feel afraid to move the question again, that the violation of the law would not, with so many abettors, involve any guilt; but that you would be acting as a physician to the state, when it had taken bad counsel; and that good government consists in this,—for a man to do his country as much good as possible, or, at least, to do it voluntarily no harm."


6.15.1
4157
ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοιαῦτα εἶπε , τῶν δὲ Ἀθηναίων παριόντες οἱ μὲν πλεῖστοι στρατεύειν παρῄνουν καὶ τὰ ἐψηφισμένα μὴ λύειν , οἱ δέ τινες καὶ ἀντέλεγον .
To this effect spoke Nicias. Of the Athenians, the greater part who came forward advised making the expedition, and not annulling what had been decreed; though there were some also who spoke against it.


6.15.2
4158
ἐνῆγε δὲ προθυμότατα τὴν στρατείαν Ἀλκιβιάδης ὁ Κλεινίου , βουλόμενος τῷ τε Νικίᾳ ἐναντιοῦσθαι , ὢν καὶ ἐς τ- ἄλλα διάφορος τὰ πολιτικὰ καὶ ὅτι αὐτοῦ διαβόλως ἐμνήσθη , καὶ μάλιστα στρατηγῆσαί τε ἐπιθυμῶν καὶ ἐλπίζων Σικελίαν τε δι’ αὐτοῦ καὶ Καρχηδόνα λήψεσθαι καὶ τὰ ἴδια ἅμα εὐτυχήσας χρήμασί τε καὶ δόξῃ ὠφελήσειν .
But the man who most earnestly recommended the expedition was Alcibiades son of Clinias, who at once wished to thwart Nicias—both as being in other respects opposed to him in politics, and because he had alluded to him in a disparaging manner—and was most anxious to take the command, and hoped by that means to reduce Sicily and Carthage, and at the same time, in consequence of his success, to promote his own private interests in point of fame and wealth.


6.15.3
4159
ὢν γὰρ ἐν ἀξιώματι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀστῶν , ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις μείζοσιν ἢ κατὰ τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν οὐσίαν ἐχρῆτο ἔς τε τὰς ἱπποτροφίας καὶ τὰς ἄλλας δαπάνας ·
For, being held in high repute by the citizens, he indulged his inclinations on too large a scale for his existing means, with regard to keeping horses, and all other expenses.


6.15.3
4160
ὅπερ καὶ καθεῖλεν ὕστερον τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων πόλιν οὐχ ἥκιστα .
And this too was what afterwards mainly caused the destruction of the Athenian state.


6.15.4
4161
φοβηθέντες γὰρ αὐτοῦ οἱ πολλοὶ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς τε κατὰ τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σῶμα παρανομίας ἐς τὴν δίαιταν καὶ τῆς διανοίας ὧν καθ’ ἓν ἕκαστον ἐν ὅτῳ γίγνοιτο ἔπρασσεν , ὡς τυραννίδος ἐπιθυμοῦντι πολέμιοι καθέστασαν , καὶ δημοσίᾳ κράτιστα διαθέντι τὰ τοῦ πολέμου ἰδίᾳ ἕκαστοι τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτοῦ ἀχθεσθέντες , καὶ ἄλλοις ἐπιτρέψαντες , οὐ διὰ μακροῦ ἔσφηλαν τὴν πόλιν .
For being alarmed at the extent of his disregard for the laws in his own person, with respect to his mode of life, and of his designs in the measures he severally undertook, in whatever business he might be engaged, the greater part of the people became his enemies on the belief of his aiming at tyranny; and though in his public capacity he conducted the war most ably, yet being severally offended at his habits in his private life, and committing the administration to others, after no long interval they brought their country to ruin.


6.15.5
4162
τότε δ’ οὖν παρελθὼν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις παρῄνει τοιάδε .
However, at that time he came forward, and advised the Athenians as follows:


6.16.1
4163
&quot; καὶ προσήκει μοι μᾶλλον ἑτέρων , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἄρχειν ( ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἐντεῦθεν ἄρξασθαι , ἐπειδή μου Νικίας καθήψατο ) , καὶ ἄξιος ἅμα νομίζω εἶναι .
"It is both befitting, Athenians, for me, more than others, to enjoy command, (for with this topic must I commence my speech,]since Cleon has attacked me upon it,) and at the same time, I deem myself worthy of it.


6.16.1
4164
ὧν γὰρ πέρι ἐπιβόητός εἰμι , τοῖς μὲν προγόνοις μου καὶ ἐμοὶ δόξαν φέρει ταῦτα , τῇ δὲ πατρίδι καὶ ὠφελίαν .
For those things about which I am so assailed with clamour, confer honour on my ancestors and myself, and benefit on my country at the same time.


6.16.2
4165
οἱ γὰρ Ἕλληνες καὶ ὑπὲρ δύναμιν μείζω ἡμῶν τὴν πόλιν ἐνόμισαν τῷ ἐμῷ διαπρεπεῖ τῆς Ὀλυμπίαζε θεωρίας , πρότερον ἐλπίζοντες αὐτὴν καταπεπολεμῆσθαι , διότι ἅρματα μὲν ἑπτὰ καθῆκα , ὅσα οὐδείς πω ἰδιώτης πρότερον , ἐνίκησα δὲ καὶ δεύτερος καὶ τέταρτος ἐγενόμην καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἀξίως τῆς νίκης παρεσκευασάμην .
For the Greeks considered our state to be greater than they had ever done, even beyond its actual power, through the splendour of my display as its deputy to the Olympic games; (whereas they hoped before that it had been exhausted by the war;) inasmuch as I entered seven chariots—a number which no private individual had ever yet entered—and gained the first prize, and was second and fourth, and provided every thing else in a style worthy of my victory.


6.16.2
4166
νόμῳ μὲν γὰρ τιμὴ τὰ τοιαῦτα , ἐκ δὲ τοῦ δρωμένου καὶ δύναμις ἅμα ὑπονοεῖται .
For according to the usual view of them, such things are a subject of honour; while, from the practice of them, an idea of power is also formed.


6.16.3
4167
καὶ ὅσα αὖ ἐν τῇ πόλει χορηγίαις ἢ ἄλλῳ τῳ λαμπρύνομαι , τοῖς μὲν ἀστοῖς φθονεῖται φύσει , πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ξένους καὶ αὕτη ἰσχὺς φαίνεται .
And again, whatever distinction I gain at home by my exhibitions of choruses, or in any other way, it is naturally envied by my fellow-citizens, but for foreigners this too has an appearance of power.


6.16.3
4168
καὶ οὐκ ἄχρηστος ἥδ’ ἡ ἄνοια , ὃς ἂν τοῖς ἰδίοις τέλεσι μὴ ἑαυτὸν μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν πόλιν ὠφελῇ .
And this is no useless folly, when a man benefits at his own costs, not himself only, but his country also. Nor is it unfair for one who prides himself on his own prosperity, to refuse to be on an equality with the mass;


6.16.4
4169
οὐδέ γε ἄδικον ἐφ’ ἑαυτῷ μέγα φρονοῦντα μὴ ἴσον εἶναι , ἐπεὶ καὶ ὁ κακῶς πράσσων πρὸς οὐδένα τῆς ξυμφορᾶς ἰσομοιρεῖ ·
since in the same way he who is unfortunate shares his calamities with no one else.


6.16.4
4170
ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ δυστυχοῦντες οὐ προσαγορευόμεθα , ἐν τῷ ὁμοίῳ τις ἀνεχέσθω καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν εὐπραγούντων ὑπερφρονούμενος , ἢ τὰ ἴσα νέμων τὰ ὁμοῖα ἀνταξιούτω .
But as we are not courted when in adversity, by the same rule let a man also submit to be slighted by the prosperous; or let him treat the unfortunate as on an equal footing, [when he is in prosperity,] and so claim the like treatment in return, [when he is himself in adversity].


6.16.5
4171
οἶδα δὲ τοὺς τοιούτους , καὶ ὅσοι ἔν τινος λαμπρότητι προέσχον , ἐν μὲν τῷ καθ’ αὑτοὺς βίῳ λυπηροὺς ὄντας , τοῖς ὁμοίοις μὲν μάλιστα , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ξυνόντας , τῶν δὲ ἔπειτα ἀνθρώπων προσποίησίν τε ξυγγενείας τισὶ καὶ μὴ οὖσαν καταλιπόντας , καὶ ἧς ἂν ὦσι πατρίδος , ταύτῃ αὔχησιν ὡς οὐ περὶ ἀλλοτρίων οὐδ’ ἁμαρτόντων , ἀλλ’ ὡς περὶ σφετέρων τε καὶ καλὰ πραξάντων .
I know, however, that men in such circumstances, and all who ever surpassed others in splendour of any kind, though disliked in their own life—time, most of all in their dealings with their equals, and then with the rest of the world also, have yet left to some of those who came after them a desire to claim connexion with them, even where there were no grounds for it; and a subject for glorying to the country they belonged to, not as for aliens, or offenders, but as for countrymen, who had achieved glorious things.


6.16.6
4172
ὧν ἐγὼ ὀρεγόμενος καὶ διὰ ταῦτα τὰ ἴδια ἐπιβοώμενος τὰ δημόσια σκοπεῖτε εἴ του χεῖρον μεταχειρίζω .
And in my case, who aim at such things, and am therefore in private assailed with clamour, consider, with regard to public affairs, whether I administer them in a manner inferior to any one else, or not.


6.16.6
4173
Πελοποννήσου γὰρ τὰ δυνατώτατα ξυστήσας ἄνευ μεγάλου ὑμῖν κινδύνου καὶ δαπάνης Λακεδαιμονίους ἐς μίαν ἡμέραν κατέστησα ἐν Μαντινείᾳ περὶ τῶν ἁπάντων ἀγωνίσασθαι ·
For having united the most powerful states of the Peloponnese, without any great danger or expense to you, I brought the Lacedaemonians to a single day's struggle for their all at Mantinea.


6.16.6
4174
ἐξ οὗ καὶ περιγενόμενοι τῇ μάχῃ οὐδέπω καὶ νῦν βεβαίως θαρσοῦσιν .
In consequence of this, although they were victorious in the battle, they do not ever now feel any firm confidence in themselves.


6.17.1
4175
&quot; καὶ ταῦτα ἡ ἐμὴ νεότης καὶ ἄνοια παρὰ φύσιν δοκοῦσα εἶναι ἐς τὴν Πελοποννησίων δύναμιν λόγοις τε πρέπουσιν ὡμίλησε καὶ ὀργῇ πίστιν παρασχομένη ἔπεισεν .
"In this way, then, did my youth and preternatural folly, as it is thought, deal with the power of the Peloponnesians by means of suitable arguments; and gaining credit by my vehemence, obtained their assent.


6.17.1
4176
καὶ νῦν μὴ πεφόβησθε αὐτήν , ἀλλ’ ἕως ἐγώ τε ἔτι ἀκμάζω μετ’ αὐτῆς καὶ ὁ Νικίας εὐτυχὴς δοκεῖ εἶναι , ἀποχρήσασθε τῇ ἑκατέρου ἡμῶν ὠφελίᾳ .
And now too be not afraid of it; but while I am still in the flower of it, and Nicias appears fortunate, avail yourselves fully of the services of each of us.


6.17.2
4177
καὶ τὸν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν πλοῦν μὴ μεταγιγνώσκετε ὡς ἐπὶ μεγάλην δύναμιν ἐσόμενον .
And with regard to the expedition to Sicily, change not your determination from an idea that it would be undertaken against a great power.


6.17.2
4178
ὄχλοις τε γὰρ ξυμμείκτοις πολυανδροῦσιν αἱ πόλεις καὶ ῥᾳδίας ἔχουσι τῶν πολιτῶν τὰς μεταβολὰς καὶ ἐπιδοχάς .
For it is only with a mixed rabble that its cities are populous; and they easily admit changes in their government, and adopt new ones.


6.17.3
4179
καὶ οὐδεὶς δι’ αὐτὸ ὡς περὶ οἰκείας πατρίδος οὔτε τὰ περὶ τὸ σῶμα ὅπλοις ἐξήρτυται οὔτε τὰ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ νομίμοις κατασκευαῖς ·
And for this reason no one is furnished, as though in behalf of his own country, either with arms for the person, or with ordinary resources, as regards the country;


6.17.3
4180
ὅτι δὲ ἕκαστος ἢ ἐκ τοῦ λέγων πείθειν οἴεται ἢ στασιάζων ἀπὸ τοῦ κοινοῦ λαβὼν ἄλλην γῆν , μὴ κατορθώσας , οἰκήσειν , ταῦτα ἑτοιμάζεται .
but whatever each one thinks that he can get from the people, either by persuading them through his oratory, or by factious measures, and will so find a home in another land, in case of his not being successful, with that he provides himself.


6.17.4
4181
καὶ οὐκ εἰκὸς τὸν τοιοῦτον ὅμιλον οὔτε λόγου μιᾷ γνώμῃ ἀκροᾶσθαι οὔτε ἐς τὰ ἔργα κοινῶς τρέπεσθαι ·
It is not likely, then, that a populace of such a character should either listen to any counsel with one heart, or apply themselves to action in common:


6.17.4
4182
ταχὺ δ’ ἂν ὡς ἕκαστοι , εἴ τι καθ’ ἡδονὴν λέγοιτο , προσχωροῖεν , ἄλλως τε καὶ εἰ στασιάζουσιν , ὥσπερ πυνθανόμεθα .
but they would severally side with whatever was said to please them; especially if they are torn by factions, as we hear.


6.17.5
4183
καὶ μὴν οὐδ’ ὁπλῖται οὔτ’ ἐκείνοις ὅσοιπερ κομποῦνται , οὔτε οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες διεφάνησαν τοσοῦτοι ὄντες ὅσους ἕκαστοι σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ἠρίθμουν , ἀλλὰ μέγιστον δὴ αὐτοὺς ἐψευσμένη ἡ Ἑλλὰς μόλις ἐν τῷδε τῷ πολέμῳ ἱκανῶς ὡπλίσθη .
Again, with regard to heavy-armed troops, neither have the Siceliots so many as are boasted of, nor did the rest of the Greeks prove so numerous as they severally reckoned themselves; but Greece had very much misstated them, and was with difficulty equipped with them in sufficient numbers on the outbreak of this war.


6.17.6
4184
τά τε οὖν ἐκεῖ , ἐξ ὧν ἐγὼ ἀκοῇ αἰσθάνομαι , τοιαῦτα καὶ ἔτι εὐπορώτερα ἔσται ( βαρβάρους τε γὰρ πολλοὺς ἕξομεν οἳ Συρακοσίων μίσει ξυνεπιθήσονται αὐτοῖς ) καὶ τὰ ἐνθάδε οὐκ ἐπικωλύσει , ἢν ὑμεῖς ὀρθῶς βουλεύησθε .
The states in those parts, then, from what I learn by report, are of this character, and still more easy to deal with—for we shall have many barbarians, who from hatred of the Syracusans will join us in attacking them—and those here will not prove an obstacle, if you take a right view of the matter.


6.17.7
4185
οἱ γὰρ πατέρες ἡμῶν τοὺς αὐτοὺς τούτους οὕσπερ νῦν φασὶ πολεμίους ὑπολείποντας ἂν ἡμᾶς πλεῖν καὶ προσέτι τὸν Μῆδον ἐχθρὸν ἔχοντες τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐκτήσαντο , οὐκ ἄλλῳ τινὶ ἢ τῇ περιουσίᾳ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ ἰσχύοντες .
For our fathers had these very men, whom they say you would leave behind you in hostility when sailing there, and the Mede beside, as their enemies; and still they won their empire; though strong in nothing else but the superiority of their fleet.


6.17.8
4186
καὶ νῦν οὔτε ἀνέλπιστοί πω μᾶλλον Πελοποννήσιοι ἐς ἡμᾶς ἐγένοντο , εἴ τε καὶ πάνυ ἔρρωνται , τὸ μὲν ἐς τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν ἐσβάλλειν , κἂν μὴ ἐκπλεύσωμεν , ἱκανοί εἰσι , τῷ δὲ ναυτικῷ οὐκ ἂν δύναιντο βλάπτειν ·
And as things stand now, never yet were the Peloponnesians more hopeless with regard to us:


6.17.8
4187
ὑπόλοιπον γὰρ ἡμῖν ἐστὶν ἀντίπαλον ναυτικόν .
and even if they are ever so confident, for invading our country indeed they are strong enough, even though we do not undertake the expedition; but with their naval force they cannot hurt us, [though we do undertake it;] for we have a fleet left behind that is a match for them.


6.18.1
4188
ὥστε τί ἂν λέγοντες εἰκὸς ἢ αὐτοὶ ἀποκνοῖμεν ἢ πρὸς τοὺς ἐκεῖ ξυμμάχους σκηπτόμενοι μὴ βοηθοῖμεν ;
"On what reasonable argument, then, could we ourselves shrink from it; or on what plea addressed to our allies there could we refuse to succour them?


6.18.1
4189
οἷς χρεών , ἐπειδή γε καὶ ξυνωμόσαμεν , ἐπαμύνειν , καὶ μὴ ἀντιτιθέναι ὅτι οὐδὲ ἐκεῖνοι ἡμῖν .
For since we have entered into league with them, we ought to assist them, and not to object that they too have not assisted us.


6.18.1
4190
οὐ γὰρ ἵνα δεῦρο ἀντιβοηθῶσι προσεθέμεθα αὐτούς , ἀλλ’ ἵνα τοῖς ἐκεῖ ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν λυπηροὶ ὄντες δεῦρο κωλύωσιν αὐτοὺς ἐπιέναι .
For we united them with us, not that they might come here to help us in their turn, but that by annoying our enemies there they might prevent their coming here to attack us."


6.18.2
4191
τήν τε ἀρχὴν οὕτως ἐκτησάμεθα καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ ὅσοι δὴ ἄλλοι ἦρξαν , παραγιγνόμενοι προθύμως τοῖς αἰεὶ ἢ βαρβάροις ἢ Ἕλλησιν ἐπικαλουμένοις , ἐπεὶ εἴ γε ἡσυχάζοιεν πάντες ἢ φυλοκρινοῖεν οἷς χρεὼν βοηθεῖν , βραχὺ ἄν τι προσκτώμενοι αὐτῇ περὶ αὐτῆς ἂν ταύτης μᾶλλον κινδυνεύοιμεν .
"And it is in this way that empire has been won, both by us and by all others who have enjoyed it; I mean, by readily taking part with those barbarians or Greeks who from time to time called them to their aid;


6.18.2
4192
τὸν γὰρ προύχοντα οὐ μόνον ἐπιόντα τις ἀμύνεται , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅπως μὴ ἔπεισι προκαταλαμβάνει .
since if all should remain quiet, or nicely choose whom they ought to assist; we should make but slight additions to it, but should rather run a risk of losing even what it now is."


6.18.3
4193
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμῖν ταμιεύεσθαι ἐς ὅσον βουλόμεθα ἄρχειν , ἀλλ’ ἀνάγκη , ἐπειδήπερ ἐν τῷδε καθέσταμεν , τοῖς μὲν ἐπιβουλεύειν , τοὺς δὲ μὴ ἀνιέναι , διὰ τὸ ἀρχθῆναι ἂν ὑφ’ ἑτέρων αὐτοῖς κίνδυνον εἶναι , εἰ μὴ αὐτοὶ ἄλλων ἄρχοιμεν .
"For men do not only defend themselves against a superior when he has attacked them, but also strike the first blow, to prevent his attacking them.


6.18.3
4194
καὶ οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐπισκεπτέον ὑμῖν τοῖς ἄλλοις τὸ ἥσυχον , εἰ μὴ καὶ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ἐς τὸ ὁμοῖον μεταλήψεσθε .
And it is not possible for us to portion out exactly how far we wish to hold dominion; but since we are in our present position, we must form designs against some, and not give up others; because we should be subjected to the rule of another party, if we did not ourselves rule over others. Nor must you take the same view of quiet as the rest of the world, unless you will also receive fresh institutions assimilating to theirs."


6.18.4
4195
&quot; λογισάμενοι οὖν τάδε μᾶλλον αὐξήσειν , ἐπ’ ἐκεῖνα ἢν ἴωμεν , ποιώμεθα τὸν πλοῦν , ἵνα Πελοποννησίων τε στορέσωμεν τὸ φρόνημα , εἰ δόξομεν ὑπεριδόντες τὴν ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἡσυχίαν καὶ ἐπὶ Σικελίαν πλεῦσαι ·
"Considering, then, that we shall rather aggrandize our possessions here, if we go in quest of those there, let us make the expedition;


6.18.4
4196
καὶ ἅμα ἢ τῆς Ἑλλάδος τῶν ἐκεῖ προσγενομένων πάσης τῷ εἰκότι ἄρξομεν , ἢ κακώσομέν γε Συρακοσίους , ἐν ᾧ καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ὠφελησόμεθα .
that we may both prostrate the pride of the Peloponnesians, by being seen, regardless of present peace, to sail even against Sicily; and at the same time, by either ruling, as we most probably shall, over the whole of Greece, through being joined by those there, or at any rate by injuring the Syracusans, by which both ourselves and our allies will be benefited."


6.18.5
4197
τὸ δὲ ἀσφαλές , καὶ μένειν , ἤν τι προχωρῇ , καὶ ἀπελθεῖν , αἱ νῆες παρέξουσιν ·
"And as for security, whether for remaining there, in case of any success, or for returning, our fleet will provide us with it:


6.18.5
4198
ναυκράτορες γὰρ ἐσόμεθα καὶ ξυμπάντων Σικελιωτῶν .
for by sea we shall be superior to all the Siceliots put together."


6.18.6
4199
καὶ μὴ ὑμᾶς ἡ Νικίου τῶν λόγων ἀπραγμοσύνη καὶ διάστασις τοῖς νέοις ἐς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ἀποτρέψῃ , τῷ δὲ εἰωθότι κόσμῳ , ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἅμα νέοι γεραιτέροις βουλεύοντες ἐς τάδε ἦραν αὐτά , καὶ νῦν τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ πειρᾶσθε προαγαγεῖν τὴν πόλιν , καὶ νομίσατε νεότητα μὲν καὶ γῆρας ἄνευ ἀλλήλων μηδὲν δύνασθαι , ὁμοῦ δὲ τό τε φαῦλον καὶ τὸ μέσον καὶ τὸ πάνυ ἀκριβὲς ἂν ξυγκραθὲν μάλιστ’ ἂν ἰσχύειν , καὶ τὴν πόλιν , ἐὰν μὲν ἡσυχάζῃ , τρίψεσθαί τε αὐτὴν περὶ αὑτὴν ὥσπερ καὶ ἄλλο τι , καὶ πάντων τὴν ἐπιστήμην ἐγγηράσεσθαι , ἀγωνιζομένην δὲ αἰεὶ προσλήψεσθαί τε τὴν ἐμπειρίαν καὶ τὸ ἀμύνεσθαι οὐ λόγῳ ἀλλ’ ἔργῳ μᾶλλον ξύνηθες ἕξειν .
" And let not the non-interfering policy which Nicias recommends in his speeches, nor his setting the young against the old, divert you from your purpose; but acting in your usual order, just as our fathers, by consulting young with old, raised the state to its present height, do ye now too, in the same manner, endeavour to advance it; being convinced that youth and old age can do nothing without each other; but that the period of levity, and of mid-age, and of extreme preciseness, will have most power when joined together; and that the state, if it remain quiet, will be worn out on itself, like any thing else, and its skill in every thing grow dull; while by entering into contest it will continually gain fresh experience, and will find self—defence habitual to it, not in word, but rather in deed."


6.18.7
4200
παράπαν τε γιγνώσκω πόλιν μὴ ἀπράγμονα τάχιστ’ ἄν μοι δοκεῖν ἀπραγμοσύνης μεταβολῇ διαφθαρῆναι , καὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀσφαλέστατα τούτους οἰκεῖν οἳ ἂν τοῖς παροῦσιν ἤθεσι καὶ νόμοις , ἢν καὶ χείρω ᾖ , ἥκιστα διαφόρως πολιτεύωσιν &quot; .
" My decided opinion then is, that I think a state of no inactive character would most quickly be ruined by a change to inactivity; and that those men live most securely, who regulate their affairs in accordance with their existing habits and institutions, even though they may be of an inferior character, with the least variation."


6.19.1
4201
τοιαῦτα μὲν ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης εἶπεν ·
To this effect spoke Alcibiades.


6.19.1
4202
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀκούσαντες ἐκείνου τε καὶ τῶν Ἐγεσταίων καὶ Λεοντίνων φυγάδων , οἳ παρελθόντες ἐδέοντό τε καὶ τῶν ὁρκίων ὑπομιμνῄσκοντες ἱκέτευον βοηθῆσαι σφίσι , πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον ὥρμηντο στρατεύειν .
When the Athenians had heard him and the Segestans and some Leontine exiles, who, coming forward, begged and entreated them to assist them, reminding them of their oaths, they were much more eager for the expedition than before.


6.19.2
4203
καὶ ὁ Νικίας γνοὺς ὅτι ἀπὸ μὲν τῶν αὐτῶν λόγων οὐκ ἂν ἔτι ἀποτρέψειε , παρασκευῆς δὲ πλήθει , εἰ πολλὴν ἐπιτάξειε , τάχ’ ἂν μεταστήσειεν αὐτούς , παρελθὼν αὐτοῖς αὖθις ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
So Nicias, perceiving that he could not now turn them from it by the same arguments as he had used before, but might perhaps change their purpose by the amount of armament, if he should command a numerous one to be prepared; he came forward again, and addressed them as follows:


6.20.1
4204
&quot; ἐπειδὴ πάντως ὁρῶ ὑμᾶς , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὡρμημένους στρατεύειν , ξυνενέγκοι μὲν ταῦτα ὡς βουλόμεθα , ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ παρόντι ἃ γιγνώσκω σημανῶ .
"Since I see you, Athenians, altogether bent on making the expedition, may these things turn out as we wish: at the present time, however, I will declare to you what my opinion is.


6.20.2
4205
ἐπὶ γὰρ πόλεις , ὡς ἐγὼ ἀκοῇ αἰσθάνομαι , μέλλομεν ἰέναι μεγάλας καὶ οὔθ’ ὑπηκόους ἀλλήλων οὔτε δεομένας μεταβολῆς , ᾗ ἂν ἐκ βιαίου τις δουλείας ἄσμενος ἐς ῥᾴω μετάστασιν χωροίη , οὐδ’ ἂν τὴν ἀρχὴν τὴν ἡμετέραν εἰκότως ἀντ’ ἐλευθερίας προσδεξαμένας , τό τε πλῆθος ὡς ἐν μιᾷ νήσῳ πολλὰς τὰς Ἑλληνίδας .
We are about to go then, as I learn from report, against cities which are great, and not subject one to another, or in want of a change, like that by which men would gladly pass from a state of violent slavery to an easier condition instead f it; which will reasonably refuse to accept our dominion instead of freedom, and are many in number, considering that they are in one island, even those of Greek origin.


6.20.3
4206
πλὴν γὰρ Νάξου καὶ Κατάνης , ἃς ἐλπίζω ἡμῖν κατὰ τὸ Λεοντίνων ξυγγενὲς προσέσεσθαι , ἄλλαι εἰσὶν ἑπτά , καὶ παρεσκευασμέναι τοῖς πᾶσιν ὁμοιοτρόπως μάλιστα τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ δυνάμει , καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα ἐπὶ ἃς μᾶλλον πλέομεν , Σελινοῦς καὶ Συράκουσαι .
For besides Naxos and Catana, which I expect will side with us on the strength of their connexion with Leontini, there are seven others, and those equipped with every thing in a style just agreeing with our own power, and most of all, those against which we are more especially sailing, namely, Selinus and Syracuse.


6.20.4
4207
πολλοὶ μὲν γὰρ ὁπλῖται ἔνεισι καὶ τοξόται καὶ ἀκοντισταί , πολλαὶ δὲ τριήρεις καὶ ὄχλος ὁ πληρώσων αὐτάς .
For there are in them many heavy-armed, and bowmen, and dartmen, with many triremes, and crowds to man them.


6.20.4
4208
χρήματά τ’ ἔχουσι τὰ μὲν ἴδια , τὰ δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς ἐστὶ Σελινουντίοις , Συρακοσίοις δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ βαρβάρων τινῶν ἀπαρχὴ ἐσφέρεται ·
They have money too, partly in private funds, and partly in the temples also at Selinus; while the Syracusans have also first-fruits paid them by certain barbarian tribes.


6.20.4
4209
ᾧ δὲ μάλιστα ἡμῶν προύχουσιν , ἵππους τε πολλοὺς κέκτηνται καὶ σίτῳ οἰκείῳ καὶ οὐκ ἐπακτῷ χρῶνται .
But what they most of all excel us in is, that they possess many horses, and use corn of native growth, and not imported.


6.21.1
4210
&quot; πρὸς οὖν τοιαύτην δύναμιν οὐ ναυτικῆς καὶ φαύλου στρατιᾶς μόνον δεῖ , ἀλλὰ καὶ πεζὸν πολὺν ξυμπλεῖν , εἴπερ βουλόμεθα ἄξιον τῆς διανοίας δρᾶν καὶ μὴ ὑπὸ ἱππέων πολλῶν εἴργεσθαι τῆς γῆς , ἄλλως τε καὶ εἰ ξυστῶσιν αἱ πόλεις φοβηθεῖσαι καὶ μὴ ἀντιπαράσχωσιν ἡμῖν φίλοι τινὲς γενόμενοι ἄλλοι ἢ Ἐγεσταῖοι ᾧ ἀμυνούμεθα ἱππικόν ( αἰσχρὸν δὲ βιασθέντας ἀπελθεῖν ἢ ὕστερον ἐπιμεταπέμπεσθαι , τὸ πρῶτον ἀσκέπτως βουλευσαμένους ) ·
"Against such a power then we require, not only a marine and inefficient armament, but that a large land force also should sail with us, if we are to achieve any thing suitable to our design, and are not to be shut out from the land by numerous cavalry; especially should the cities league together in their fear, and none but the Segestans be our friends, and furnish us with horse, wherewith to defend ourselves.


6.21.2
4211
αὐτόθεν δὲ παρασκευῇ ἀξιόχρεῳ ἐπιέναι , γνόντας ὅτι πολύ τε ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμετέρας αὐτῶν μέλλομεν πλεῖν καὶ οὐκ ἐν τῷ ὁμοίῳ στρατευσόμενοι καὶ ὅτε ἐν τοῖς τῇδε ὑπηκόοις ξύμμαχοι ἤλθετε ἐπί τινα , ὅθεν ῥᾴδιαι αἱ κομιδαὶ ἐκ τῆς φιλίας ὧν προσέδει , ἀλλ’ ἐς ἀλλοτρίαν πᾶσαν ἀπαρτήσοντες , ἐξ ἧς μηνῶν οὐδὲ τεσσάρων τῶν χειμερινῶν ἄγγελον ῥᾴδιον ἐλθεῖν .
But it were disgraceful to return by compulsion, or to send for fresh supplies afterwards, through having inconsiderately formed our plans at first. On the contrary, we must go against them with sufficient forces, knowing that we are about to sail far from our own country, and not on an expedition of the same kind as when you have gone at different times, in the character of allies, against any of your subjects in these parts, where supplies of additional necessaries were easily obtained from the friendly territory; but departing to a land altogether alien to you, from which for as many as four months in the winter it is not easy for a messenger to come here.


6.22.1
4212
ὁπλίτας τε οὖν πολλούς μοι δοκεῖ χρῆναι ἡμᾶς ἄγειν καὶ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων , τῶν τε ὑπηκόων καὶ ἤν τινα ἐκ Πελοποννήσου δυνώμεθα ἢ πεῖσαι ἢ μισθῷ προσαγαγέσθαι , καὶ τοξότας πολλοὺς καὶ σφενδονήτας , ὅπως πρὸς τὸ ἐκείνων ἱππικὸν ἀντέχωσι , ναυσί τε καὶ πολὺ περιεῖναι , ἵνα καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ῥᾷον ἐσκομιζώμεθα , τὸν δὲ καὶ αὐτόθεν σῖτον ἐν ὁλκάσι , πυροὺς καὶ πεφρυγμένας κριθάς , ἄγειν , καὶ σιτοποιοὺς ἐκ τῶν μυλώνων πρὸς μέρος ἠναγκασμένους ἐμμίσθους , ἵνα , ἤν που ὑπὸ ἀπλοίας ἀπολαμβανώμεθα , ἔχῃ ἡ στρατιὰ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ( πολλὴ γὰρ οὖσα οὐ πάσης ἔσται πόλεως ὑποδέξασθαι ) , τά τε ἄλλα ὅσον δυνατὸν ἑτοιμάσασθαι , καὶ μὴ ἐπὶ ἑτέροις γίγνεσθαι , μάλιστα δὲ χρήματα αὐτόθεν ὡς πλεῖστα ἔχειν .
"I think therefore that we ought to take many heavy-armed, both of our own and of our allies, whether those who are subject to us, or any in the Peloponnese that we may be able either to prevail upon by argument, or to take into our pay; many bowmen also and slingers, to offer resistance to the Sicilian horse; and that in ships we should have a very decided superiority, in order that we may the more easily bring in what is necessary: while we take our corn from home also in merchant vessels, namely, wheat and parched barley, with bakers from the mills, compelled, in proportion to their numbers, to serve for pay; that should we any where be detained by stress of weather, the force may have provisions; (for so numerous as it is, it will not be one for every city to receive.) All other things too we must provide, as far as we can, and not depend upon others; but, most of all, we must take from home as much money as possible.


6.22.1
4213
τὰ δὲ παρ’ Ἐγεσταίων , ἃ λέγεται ἐκεῖ ἑτοῖμα , νομίσατε καὶ λόγῳ ἂν μάλιστα ἑτοῖμα εἶναι .
For as for that of the Segestans, which is asserted to be there in readiness, believe that it is in the way of assertion, more than in any other way, that it will be ready."


6.23.1
4214
ἢν γὰρ αὐτοὶ ἔλθωμεν ἐνθένδε μὴ ἀντίπαλον μόνον παρασκευασάμενοι ,πλήν γε πρὸς τὸ μάχιμον αὐτῶν , τὸ ὁπλιτικόν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑπερβάλλοντες τοῖς πᾶσι , μόλις οὕτως οἷοί τε ἐσόμεθα τῶν μὲν κρατεῖν , τὰ δὲ καὶ διασῶσαι .
" For supposing us to go hence, not only provided on a scale equal to the enemy, ( excepting, at least, their heavy-armed fighting force,) but even surpassing them in all respects; yet scarcely even then shall we be able to subdue that country, and to save this. Indeed we must consider that we are going to found a city amongst aliens and enemies;"


6.23.2
4215
πόλιν τε νομίσαι χρὴ ἐν ἀλλοφύλοις καὶ πολεμίοις οἰκιοῦντας ἰέναι , οὓς πρέπει τῇ πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἂν κατάσχωσιν εὐθὺς κρατεῖν τῆς γῆς , ἢ εἰδέναι ὅτι , ἢν σφάλλωνται , πάντα πολέμια ἕξουσιν .
" and such men must either, the first day they land, be at once masters of the country, or know that if they fail to do so, they will find every thing opposed to them."


6.23.3
4216
ὅπερ ἐγὼ φοβούμενος , καὶ εἰδὼς πολλὰ μὲν ἡμᾶς δέον εὖ βουλεύσασθαι , ἔτι δὲ πλείω εὐτυχῆσαι ( χαλεπὸν δὲ ἀνθρώπους ὄντας ) , ὅτι ἐλάχιστα τῇ τύχῃ παραδοὺς ἐμαυτὸν βούλομαι ἐκπλεῖν , παρασκευῇ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν εἰκότων ἀσφαλὴς ἐκπλεῦσαι .
"For myself then, being afraid of this, and knowing that on many points we must take good counsel, and on still more have good luck, (and that is difficult for such as are but men,) I wish to sail from home committing myself as little as possible to fortune, and secured against failure by our preparations, according to all reasonable hopes.


6.23.3
4217
ταῦτα γὰρ τῇ τε ξυμπάσῃ πόλει βεβαιότατα ἡγοῦμαι καὶ ἡμῖν τοῖς στρατευσομένοις σωτήρια .
And these things I consider safest for the whole state, and for us who are to make the expedition."


6.23.3
4218
εἰ δέ τῳ ἄλλως δοκεῖ , παρίημι αὐτῷ τὴν ἀρχήν &quot; .
"If, however, any one else has a different opinion, I resign to him the command."


6.24.1
4219
ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοσαῦτα εἶπε νομίζων τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τῷ πλήθει τῶν πραγμάτων ἢ ἀποτρέψειν ἤ , εἰ ἀναγκάζοιτο στρατεύεσθαι , μάλιστ’ ἂν οὕτως ἀσφαλῶς ἐκπλεῦσαι ·
Thus much spoke Nicias, thinking that he should either deter the Athenians by the vast scale of his measures, or that if he were compelled to join the expedition, he should in this way sail on it most safely.


6.24.2
4220
οἱ δὲ τὸ μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦν τοῦ πλοῦ οὐκ ἐξῃρέθησαν ὑπὸ τοῦ ὀχλώδους τῆς παρασκευῆς , πολὺ δὲ μᾶλλον ὥρμηντο , καὶ τ- ἐναντίον περιέστη αὐτῷ ·
They, however, had not their desire for the voyage taken from them by the burdensome nature of the preparations, but were much more eager for it than ever;


6.24.2
4221
εὖ τε γὰρ παραινέσαι ἔδοξε καὶ ἀσφάλεια νῦν δὴ καὶ πολλὴ ἔσεσθαι .
and the result proved just contrary to what he had expected; for it was thought that he had given them good advice, and that now certainly they would have even abundant assurance of success.


6.24.3
4222
καὶ ἔρως ἐνέπεσε τοῖς πᾶσιν ὁμοίως ἐκπλεῦσαι ·
And so all alike were seized with a longing to go on the expedition:


6.24.3
4223
τοῖς μὲν γὰρ πρεσβυτέροις ὡς ἢ καταστρεψομένοις ἐφ’ ἃ ἔπλεον ἢ οὐδὲν ἂν σφαλεῖσαν μεγάλην δύναμιν , τοῖς δ’ ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ τῆς τε ἀπούσης πόθῳ ὄψεως καὶ θεωρίας , καὶ εὐέλπιδες ὄντες σωθήσεσθαι ·
the elder, from a belief that they should either subdue the places against which they were about to sail, or that a large force would meet with no misfortune:


6.24.3
4224
ὁ δὲ πολὺς ὅμιλος καὶ στρατιώτης ἔν τε τῷ παρόντι ἀργύριον οἴσειν καὶ προσκτήσεσθαι δύναμιν ὅθεν ἀίδιον μισθοφορὰν ὑπάρξειν .
those in the prime of life, from a desire of foreign sights and spectacles, and because they were in good hope of returning safe from it: the mass of the people and of the soldiery, from thinking that they should both make money at present, and gain additional power, from which an unfailing fund for pay would be obtained.


6.24.4
4225
ὥστε διὰ τὴν ἄγαν τῶν πλεόνων ἐπιθυμίαν , εἴ τῳ ἄρα καὶ μὴ ἤρεσκε , δεδιὼς μὴ ἀντιχειροτονῶν κακόνους δόξειεν εἶναι τῇ πόλει ἡσυχίαν ἦγεν .
So that owing to the excessive desire of the majority for the measure, even if any one were not pleased with it, he was afraid that by voting against it he might appear ill—affected to the state, and therefore held his peace.


6.25.1
4226
καὶ τέλος παρελθών τις τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ παρακαλέσας τὸν Νικίαν οὐκ ἔφη χρῆναι προφασίζεσθαι οὐδὲ διαμέλλειν , ἀλλ’ ἐναντίον ἁπάντων ἤδη λέγειν ἥντινα αὐτῷ παρασκευὴν Ἀθηναῖοι ψηφίσωνται .
At last one of the Athenians came forward, and calling on Nicias, said that he ought not to make excuses and to procrastinate, but to say now before them all, what forces the Athenians should vote him.


6.25.2
4227
ὁ δὲ ἄκων μὲν εἶπεν ὅτι καὶ μετὰ τῶν ξυναρχόντων καθ’ ἡσυχίαν μᾶλλον βουλεύσοιτο , ὅσα μέντοι ἤδη δοκεῖν αὐτῷ , τριήρεσι μὲν οὐκ ἔλασσον ἢ ἑκατὸν πλευστέα εἶναι ( αὐτῶν δ’ Ἀθηναίων ἔσεσθαι ὁπλιταγωγοὺς ὅσαι ἂν δοκῶσι , καὶ ἄλλας ἐκ τῶν ξυμμάχων μεταπεμπτέας εἶναι ) , ὁπλίταις δὲ τοῖς ξύμπασιν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων πεντακισχιλίων μὲν οὐκ ἐλάσσοσιν , ἢν δέ τι δύνωνται , καὶ πλέοσιν ·
He then, though reluctantly, said that he would deliberate more leisurely on the question, in concert with his colleagues:


6.25.2
4228
τὴν δὲ ἄλλην παρασκευὴν ὡς κατὰ λόγον , καὶ τοξοτῶν τῶν αὐτόθεν καὶ ἐκ Κρήτης καὶ σφενδονητῶν , καὶ ἤν τι ἄλλο πρέπον δοκῇ εἶναι , ἑτοιμασάμενοι ἄξειν .
as far, however, as he saw at present, they should not sail with less than a hundred triremes, (as many of the Athenian ships as might be thought fit would carry the heavy infantry, while others must be sent for from the allies,) with not fewer than five thousand heavy-armed in all, of the Athenians and the allies, and even more, if at all possible; and that they would get ready and take with them the rest of the armament in proportion, both archers from home and from Crete, slingers, and whatever else should be thought proper.


6.26.1
4229
ἀκούσαντες δ’ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐψηφίσαντο εὐθὺς αὐτοκράτορας εἶναι καὶ περὶ στρατιᾶς πλήθους καὶ περὶ τοῦ παντὸς πλοῦ τοὺς στρατηγοὺς πράσσειν ᾗ ἂν αὐτοῖς δοκῇ ἄριστα εἶναι Ἀθηναίοις .
The Athenians, after hearing him, immediately voted that the generals should be invested with full powers to make arrangements, both concerning the number of troops, and every thing connected with the whole expedition, as they might judge to be best for Athens.


6.26.2
4230
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἡ παρασκευὴ ἐγίγνετο , καὶ ἔς τε τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἔπεμπον καὶ αὐτόθεν καταλόγους ἐποιοῦντο , ἄρτι δ’ ἀνειλήφει ἡ πόλις ἑαυτὴν ἀπὸ τῆς νόσου καὶ τοῦ ξυνεχοῦς πολέμου ἔς τε ἡλικίας πλῆθος ἐπιγεγενημένης καὶ ἐς χρημάτων ἅθροισιν διὰ τὴν ἐκεχειρίαν , ὥστε ῥᾷον πάντα ἐπορίζετο .
After this, the preparations began to be made; and they both sent to the allies, and drew up their muster-rolls at home. The city had lately recovered itself from the plague, and from continued hostilities, as regarded both the number of young men who had grown up, and the accumulation of money in consequence of the truce; so that everything was the more easily provided.


6.26.2
4231
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐν παρασκευῇ ἦσαν .
And thus they were engaged in preparations.


6.27.1
4232
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ , ὅσοι Ἑρμαῖ ἦσαν λίθινοι ἐν τῇ πόλει τῇ Ἀθηναίων ( εἰσὶ δὲ κατὰ τὸ ἐπιχώριον , ἡ τετράγωνος ἐργασία , πολλοὶ καὶ ἐν ἰδίοις προθύροις καὶ ἐν ἱεροῖς ) , μιᾷ νυκτὶ οἱ πλεῖστοι περιεκόπησαν τὰ πρόσωπα .
In the mean time, of all the stone Mercuries in the city of Athens, (they are, according to the fashion of the country, those well—known square figures, numerous both in private and sacred door—ways,) the greater part had their faces mutilated in one night. The perpetrators of this offence were known to no one;


6.27.2
4233
καὶ τοὺς δράσαντας ᾔδει οὐδείς , ἀλλὰ μεγάλοις μηνύτροις δημοσίᾳ οὗτοί τε ἐζητοῦντο καὶ προσέτι ἐψηφίσαντο , καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλο τι οἶδεν ἀσέβημα γεγενημένον , μηνύειν ἀδεῶς τὸν βουλόμενον καὶ ἀστῶν καὶ ξένων καὶ δούλων .
but search was made for them, with great rewards for information offered at the public expense. Moreover, the people voted, that if any one knew any other act of impiety to have been committed, whoever wished, whether citizen, alien, or slave, should without fear give information of it. And they took the matter up more seriously than it deserved;


6.27.3
4234
καὶ τὸ πρᾶγμα μειζόνως ἐλάμβανον ·
for it was considered to be an omen of the expedition,


6.27.3
4235
τοῦ τε γὰρ ἔκπλου οἰωνὸς ἐδόκει εἶναι καὶ ἐπὶ ξυνωμοσίᾳ ἅμα νεωτέρων πραγμάτων καὶ δήμου καταλύσεως γεγενῆσθαι .
and also to have been done on the strength of a conspiracy for bringing about a revolution, and for putting down the democracy.


6.28.1
4236
μηνύεται οὖν ἀπὸ μετοίκων τέ τινων καὶ ἀκολούθων περὶ μὲν τῶν Ἑρμῶν οὐδέν , ἄλλων δὲ ἀγαλμάτων περικοπαί τινες πρότερον ὑπὸ νεωτέρων μετὰ παιδιᾶς καὶ οἴνου γεγενημέναι , καὶ τὰ μυστήρια ἅμα ὡς ποιεῖται ἐν οἰκίαις ἐφ’ ὕβρει ·
Information therefore was given by some naturalized aliens, and slaves who were in personal attendance on their masters, though not at all respecting the Mercuries,


6.28.1
4237
ὧν καὶ τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην ἐπῃτιῶντο .
yet of certain mutilations of other images which had before been perpetrated by some young men in a drunken frolic: and, moreover, that in certain private houses the mysteries were celebrated in mockery. In this charge they implicated Alcibiades;

καὶ αὐτὰ ὑπολαμβάνοντες οἱ μάλιστα τῷ Ἀλκιβιάδῃ ἀχθόμενοι ἐμποδὼν ὄντι σφίσι μὴ αὐτοῖς τοῦ δήμου βεβαίως προεστάναι , καὶ νομίσαντες , εἰ αὐτὸν ἐξελάσειαν , πρῶτοι ἂν εἶναι , ἐμεγάλυνον καὶ ἐβόων ὡς ἐπὶ δήμου καταλύσει τά τε μυστικὰ καὶ ἡ τῶν Ἑρμῶν περικοπὴ γένοιτο καὶ οὐδὲν εἴη αὐτῶν ὅτι οὐ μετ’ ἐκείνου ἐπράχθη , ἐπιλέγοντες τεκμήρια τὴν ἄλλην αὐτοῦ ἐς τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα οὐ δημοτικὴν παρανομίαν .
and those took it up who were most hostile to him, as being an obstacle to their own taking the permanent lead of the people. Thinking therefore, that if they expelled him, they would have the first place, they magnified the business, and raised an out cry, to the effect that both the affair of the mysteries and the mutilation of the Mercuries had been done for the abolition of democracy; and that there was none of all these things that had been executed without his assistance: alleging in proof of the assertion his general contempt for the law in his personal habits, so opposed to the spirit of democracy.


6.29.1
4239
ὁ δ’ ἔν τε τῷ παρόντι πρὸς τὰ μηνύματα ἀπελογεῖτο καὶ ἑτοῖμος ἦν πρὶν ἐκπλεῖν κρίνεσθαι , εἴ τι τούτων εἰργασμένος ἦν ( ἤδη γὰρ καὶ τὰ τῆς παρασκευῆς ἐπεπόριστο ) , καὶ εἰ μὲν τούτων τι εἴργαστο , δίκην δοῦναι , εἰ δ’ ἀπολυθείη , ἄρχειν .
He at once defended himself against these charges, and was ready to submit to trial, as to his being guilty of any of these things, before going on the expedition, (for by this time all things necessary for the armament had been provided,) and if he had done any of these things, he was willing to be punished; but if he were acquitted, to take the command.


6.29.2
4240
καὶ ἐπεμαρτύρετο μὴ ἀπόντος πέρι αὐτοῦ διαβολὰς ἀποδέχεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἤδη ἀποκτείνειν , εἰ ἀδικεῖ , καὶ ὅτι σωφρονέστερον εἴη μὴ μετὰ τοιαύτης αἰτίας , πρὶν διαγνῶσι , πέμπειν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοσούτῳ στρατεύματι .
He protested, too, that they should not listen to slanders against him in his absence, but put him to death at once if he were guilty; and that it was more prudent not to send him out at the head of so large an armament, with such an accusation attaching to him, before they had decided the question.


6.29.3
4241
οἱ δ’ ἐχθροὶ δεδιότες τό τε στράτευμα μὴ εὔνουν ἔχῃ , ἢν ἤδη ἀγωνίζηται , ὅ τε δῆμος μὴ μαλακίζηται θεραπεύων ὅτι δι’ ἐκεῖνον οἵ τ’ Ἀργεῖοι ξυνεστράτευον καὶ τῶν Μαντινέων τινές , ἀπέτρεπον καὶ ἀπέσπευδον , ἄλλους ῥήτορας ἐνιέντες οἳ ἔλεγον νῦν μὲν πλεῖν αὐτὸν καὶ μὴ κατασχεῖν τὴν ἀναγωγήν , ἐλθόντα δὲ κρίνεσθαι ἐν ἡμέραις ῥηταῖς , βουλόμενοι ἐκ μείζονος διαβολῆς , ἣν ἔμελλον ῥᾷον αὐτοῦ ἀπόντος ποριεῖν , μετάπεμπτον κομισθέντα αὐτὸν ἀγωνίσασθαι .
But his enemies being afraid of the army, lest he should have its good wishes, if at once brought to trial; and lest the people should relent, who courted him, because for his sake the Argives and some of the Mantineans were joining in the expedition;


6.29.3
4242
καὶ ἔδοξε πλεῖν τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην .
they wished to put it off, and earnestly dissuaded the measure, by bringing forward other orators, who urged that at present he should sail, and not delay the departure of the army, but should on his return take his trial within such a number of days as might be appointed. For they wished to have him sent for, and brought home for trial on a graver charge, which they could more easily get up in his absence. Accordingly it was resolved that Alcibiades should sail.


6.30.1
4243
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα θέρους μεσοῦντος ἤδη ἡ ἀναγωγὴ ἐγίγνετο ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν .
After this, when it was now midsummer, the departure for Sicily took place.


6.30.1
4244
τῶν μὲν οὖν ξυμμάχων τοῖς πλείστοις καὶ ταῖς σιταγωγοῖς ὁλκάσι καὶ τοῖς πλοίοις καὶ ὅση ἄλλη παρασκευὴ ξυνείπετο πρότερον εἴρητο ἐς Κέρκυραν ξυλλέγεσθαι ὡς ἐκεῖθεν ἁθρόοις ἐπὶ ἄκραν Ἰαπυγίαν τὸν Ἰόνιον διαβαλοῦσιν ·
Now to the greater part of the allies, with the provision ships, and the smaller craft, and all the other vessels that accompanied them, orders had before been given to muster at Corcyra, with a view to their crossing the Ionian Sea in a body from that place to the Iapygian foreland.


6.30.1
4245
αὐτοὶ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ εἴ τινες τῶν ξυμμάχων παρῆσαν , ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ καταβάντες ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ῥητῇ ἅμα ἕῳ ἐπλήρουν τὰς ναῦς ὡς ἀναξόμενοι .
But the Athenians themselves, and such of the allies as were present, went down to the Piraeus on an appointed day, as soon as it was light, and proceeded to man their ships for the purpose of putting out to sea. The whole multitude too, (so to speak,) that was in the city, both of citizens and foreigners, went down with them. The natives accompanied, respectively, those who belonged to them, whether friends, kinsmen, or sons; and went at once with hope and with lamentations;


6.30.2
4246
ξυγκατέβη δὲ καὶ ὁ ἄλλος ὅμιλος ἅπας ὡς εἰπεῖν ὁ ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ἀστῶν καὶ ξένων , οἱ μὲν ἐπιχώριοι τοὺς σφετέρους αὐτῶν ἕκαστοι προπέμποντες , οἱ μὲν ἑταίρους , οἱ δὲ ξυγγενεῖς , οἱ δὲ υἱεῖς , καὶ μετ’ ἐλπίδος τε ἅμα ἰόντες καὶ ὀλοφυρμῶν , τὰ μὲν ὡς κτήσοιντο , τοὺς δ’ εἴ ποτε ὄψοιντο , ἐνθυμούμενοι ὅσον πλοῦν ἐκ τῆς σφετέρας ἀπεστέλλοντο .
with hope, that they would attain what they went for; but with lamentation, as doubtful if they should ever again see their friends, when they remembered on how long a voyage they were setting out from their country.


6.31.1
4247
καὶ ἐν τῷ παρόντι καιρῷ , ὡς ἤδη ἔμελλον μετὰ κινδύνων ἀλλήλους ἀπολιπεῖν , μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς ἐσῄει τὰ δεινὰ ἢ ὅτε ἐψηφίζοντο πλεῖν ·
At the present time too, when they were now to take leave of each other on a perilous undertaking, the thought of the dangers struck them more forcibly than when they were voting for the expedition:


6.31.1
4248
ὅμως δὲ τῇ παρούσῃ ῥώμῃ , διὰ τὸ πλῆθος ἑκάστων ὧν ἑώρων , τῇ ὄψει ἀνεθάρσουν .
though, nevertheless, they were cheered by the sight of their present strength, through the numbers of each part of the armament which they beheld.


6.31.1
4249
οἱ δὲ ξένοι καὶ ὁ ἄλλος ὄχλος κατὰ θέαν ἧκεν ὡς ἐπ’ ἀξιόχρεων καὶ ἄπιστον διάνοιαν .
As to the foreigners, and the rest of the multitude, they went to see the sight, as that of an enterprise worthy of their notice, and surpassing belief.


6.31.1
4250
παρασκευὴ γὰρ αὕτη πρώτη ἐκπλεύσασα μιᾶς πόλεως δυνάμει Ἑλληνικῇ πολυτελεστάτη δὴ καὶ εὐπρεπεστάτη τῶν ἐς ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον ἐγένετο .
This armament which first sailed out, going from a single city, and consisting of a Grecian force, was the most costly and splendid of all up to that time. Yet in number of ships and of heavy—armed, that against Epidaurus under Pericles, and the same when going against Potidaea under Hagnon, was not inferior to this: for there were in it four thousand heavy-armed of the Athenians themselves, three hundred horse, and a hundred triremes, with fifty of the Lesbians and Chians, while many allies besides joined in the expedition.


6.31.2
4251
ἀριθμῷ δὲ νεῶν καὶ ὁπλιτῶν καὶ ἡ ἐς Ἐπίδαυρον μετὰ Περικλέους καὶ ἡ αὐτὴ ἐς Ποτείδαιαν μετὰ Ἅγνωνος οὐκ ἐλάσσων ἦν ·
But they were despatched on a short voyage and with scanty preparation:


6.31.2
4252
τετράκις γὰρ χίλιοι ὁπλῖται αὐτῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τριακόσιοι ἱππῆς καὶ τριήρεις ἑκατόν , καὶ Λεσβίων καὶ Χίων πεντήκοντα , καὶ ξύμμαχοι ἔτι πολλοὶ ξυνέπλευσαν .
whereas this expedition started with the expectation of its being a long one, and was equipped for both kinds of service, whichever might be required, with ships and land forces at the same time. The fleet was elaborately fitted out, at great expense both on the part of the captains and of the state.


6.31.3
4253
ἀλλὰ ἐπί τε βραχεῖ πλῷ ὡρμήθησαν καὶ παρασκευῇ φαύλῃ , οὗτος δὲ ὁ στόλος ὡς χρόνιός τε ἐσόμενος καὶ κατ’ ἀμφότερα , οὗ ἂν δέῃ , καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ ἅμα ἐξαρτυθείς , τὸ μὲν ναυτικὸν μεγάλαις δαπάναις τῶν τε τριηράρχων καὶ τῆς πόλεως ἐκπονηθέν , τοῦ μὲν δημοσίου δραχμὴν τῆς ἡμέρας τῷ ναύτῃ ἑκάστῳ διδόντος καὶ ναῦς παρασχόντος κενὰς ἑξήκοντα μὲν ταχείας , τεσσαράκοντα δὲ ὁπλιταγωγοὺς καὶ ὑπηρεσίας ταύταις τὰς κρατίστας , τῶν δὲ τριηράρχων ἐπιφοράς τε πρὸς τῷ ἐκ δημοσίου μισθῷ διδόντων τοῖς θρανίταις τῶν ναυτῶν καὶ ταῖς ὑπηρεσίαις καὶ τ- ἄλλα σημείοις καὶ κατασκευαῖς πολυτελέσι χρησαμένων ,καὶ ἐς τὰ μακρότατα προθυμηθέντος ἑνὸς ἑκάστου ὅπως αὐτῷ τινὶ εὐπρεπείᾳ τε ἡ ναῦς μάλιστα προέξει καὶ τῷ ταχυναυτεῖν , τὸ δὲ πεζὸν καταλόγοις τε χρηστοῖς ἐκκριθὲν καὶ ὅπλων καὶ τῶν περὶ τὸ σῶμα σκευῶν μεγάλῃ σπουδῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἁμιλληθέν .
For the treasury gave a drachma a day to each seaman, and furnished empty vessels, sixty fast sailers and forty transports; while the captains provided the best crews for them, and gave gratuities in addition to the pay from the treasury, to the and to the petty officers; and made use besides of expensive ensigns and equipments; each one of them being in the highest degree desirous that his own ship should excel most in beauty and fast sailing. The land forces, on the other hand, were selected from the best muster-rolls, and vied with each other in great attention to their arms and personal accoutrements. The consequence was, that there was at once a rivalry amongst themselves, in the arm of the service to which they were severally appointed; and that with the rest of the Greeks it was imagined to be a display of power and resources, rather than an armament raised against an enemy.


6.31.4
4254
ξυνέβη δὲ πρός τε σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ἅμα ἔριν γενέσθαι , ᾧ τις ἕκαστος προσετάχθη , καὶ ἐς τοὺς ἄλλους Ἕλληνας ἐπίδειξιν μᾶλλον εἰκασθῆναι τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ ἐξουσίας ἢ ἐπὶ πολεμίους παρασκευήν .
For if any one had reckoned the public expenditure of the state, and the private outlay of individuals; with regard to the state, what sums it had already spent upon it, and what it was sending out in the hands of the generals;


6.31.5
4255
εἰ γάρ τις ἐλογίσατο τήν τε τῆς πόλεως ἀνάλωσιν δημοσίαν καὶ τῶν στρατευομένων τὴν ἰδίαν , τῆς μὲν πόλεως ὅσα τε ἤδη προετετελέκει καὶ ἃ ἔχοντας τοὺς στρατηγοὺς ἀπέστελλε , τῶν δὲ ἰδιωτῶν ἅ τε περὶ τὸ σῶμά τις καὶ τριήραρχος ἐς τὴν ναῦν ἀνηλώκει καὶ ὅσα ἔτι ἔμελλεν ἀναλώσειν , χωρὶς δ’ ἃ εἰκὸς ἦν καὶ ἄνευ τοῦ ἐκ τοῦ δημοσίου μισθοῦ πάντα τινὰ παρασκευάσασθαι ἐφόδιον ὡς ἐπὶ χρόνιον στρατείαν , καὶ ὅσα ἐπὶ μεταβολῇ τις ἢ στρατιώτης ἢ ἔμπορος ἔχων ἔπλει , πολλὰ ἂν τάλαντα ηὑρέθη ἐκ τῆς πόλεως τὰ πάντα ἐξαγόμενα .
and with regard to individuals, what each had laid out on his personal equipment, and, in the case of a captain, on his ship, with what he was likely to lay out still; and, moreover, what it was probable that every one had provided, independently of his pay from the treasury, towards the expenses of a voyage expected to be so long; and what each soldier or trader took with him for the purpose of exchange; [if all these sums, I say, had been calculated,] it would have been found that many talents in all were being taken out of the city. And the expedition was no less celebrated through men's astonishment at its boldness, and the splendour of its appearance, than for the superiority of the armament, compared with those whom they were going to attack;


6.31.6
4256
καὶ ὁ στόλος οὐχ ἧσσον τόλμης τε θάμβει καὶ ὄψεως λαμπρότητι περιβόητος ἐγένετο ἢ στρατιᾶς πρὸς οὓς ἐπῇσαν ὑπερβολῇ , καὶ ὅτι μέγιστος ἤδη διάπλους ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκείας καὶ ἐπὶ μεγίστῃ ἐλπίδι τῶν μελλόντων πρὸς τὰ ὑπάρχοντα ἐπεχειρήθη .
and from the fact of its being the longest passage from their own country that had hitherto been undertaken, and with the greatest hope of future advantages in comparison with their present means.


6.32.1
4257
ἐπειδὴ δὲ αἱ νῆες πλήρεις ἦσαν καὶ ἐσέκειτο πάντα ἤδη ὅσα ἔχοντες ἔμελλον ἀνάξεσθαι , τῇ μὲν σάλπιγγι σιωπὴ ὑπεσημάνθη , εὐχὰς δὲ τὰς νομιζομένας πρὸ τῆς ἀναγωγῆς οὐ κατὰ ναῦν ἑκάστην , ξύμπαντες δὲ ὑπὸ κήρυκος ἐποιοῦντο , κρατῆράς τε κεράσαντες παρ’ ἅπαν τὸ στράτευμα καὶ ἐκπώμασι χρυσοῖς τε καὶ ἀργυροῖς οἵ τε ἐπιβάται καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες σπένδοντες .
Now when the ships were manned, and every thing was put on board that they meant to set sail with, silence was proclaimed by trumpet, and they offered the prayers which are usual before putting out to sea; not ship by ship singly, but all together, responding to a herald; having mixed bowls of wine through the whole armament, and both seamen and their officers making oblations with gold and silver goblets.


6.32.2
4258
ξυνεπηύχοντο δὲ καὶ ὁ ἄλλος ὅμιλος ὁ ἐκ τῆς γῆς τῶν τε πολιτῶν καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος εὔνους παρῆν σφίσιν .
They were joined also in their prayers by the rest of the multitude on shore, both the citizens and whoever else was there that wished them well.


6.32.2
4259
παιανίσαντες δὲ καὶ τελεώσαντες τὰς σπονδὰς ἀνήγοντο , καὶ ἐπὶ κέρως τὸ πρῶτον ἐκπλεύσαντες ἅμιλλαν ἤδη μέχρι Αἰγίνης ἐποιοῦντο .
When they had sung their hymn, and finished their libations, they weighed anchor; and having at first sailed out in a column, they then raced each other as far as Aegina.


6.32.2
4260
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν , ἔνθαπερ καὶ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα τῶν ξυμμάχων ξυνελέγετο , ἠπείγοντο ἀφικέσθαι .
And thus they hastened to reach Corcyra, where the remaining force of the allies was also assembling.


6.32.3
4261
ἐς δὲ τὰς Συρακούσας ἠγγέλλετο μὲν πολλαχόθεν τὰ περὶ τοῦ ἐπίπλου , οὐ μέντοι ἐπιστεύετο ἐπὶ πολὺν χρόνον οὐδέν , ἀλλὰ καὶ γενομένης ἐκκλησίας ἐλέχθησαν τοιοίδε λόγοι ἀπό τε ἄλλων , τῶν μὲν πιστευόντων τὰ περὶ τῆς στρατείας τῆς τῶν Ἀθηναίων , τῶν δὲ τὰ ἐναντία λεγόντων , καὶ Ἑρμοκράτης ὁ Ἕρμωνος παρελθὼν αὐτοῖς , ὡς σαφῶς οἰόμενος εἰδέναι τὰ περὶ αὐτῶν , ἔλεγε καὶ παρῄνει τοιάδε .
Now tidings of the expedition were brought to Syracuse from many quarters, but for a long time received no credit at all. Nay, even when an assembly was held on the subject, both by others were speeches to the following effect delivered, (some believing the report of the Athenian expedition, while some contradicted it,) and Hermocrates, the son of Hermon, coming forward to them, from a conviction that he had accurate information on the subject, addressed to them the following advice:


6.33.1
4262
&quot; ἄπιστα μὲν ἴσως , ὥσπερ καὶ ἄλλοι τινές , δόξω ὑμῖν περὶ τοῦ ἐπίπλου τῆς ἀληθείας λέγειν , καὶ γιγνώσκω ὅτι οἱ τὰ μὴ πιστὰ δοκοῦντα εἶναι ἢ λέγοντες ἢ ἀπαγγέλλοντες οὐ μόνον οὐ πείθουσιν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄφρονες δοκοῦσιν εἶναι ·
"I shall, perhaps, appear to you, as some others have done, to speak what is incredible concerning the reality of the expedition that is coming against us:


6.33.1
4263
ὅμως δὲ οὐ καταφοβηθεὶς ἐπισχήσω κινδυνευούσης τῆς πόλεως , πείθων γε ἐμαυτὸν σαφέστερόν τι ἑτέρου εἰδὼς λέγειν .
and I know that those who either make statements, or bring reports, which do not seem to be credible, not only fail to convince, but are also thought to be foolish. Nevertheless I will not, through fear of this, hold my tongue when the state is in danger, since I am myself at any rate persuaded that I speak with more certain knowledge than others.


6.33.2
4264
Ἀθηναῖοι γὰρ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς , ὃ πάνυ θαυμάζετε , πολλῇ στρατιᾷ ὥρμηνται καὶ ναυτικῇ καὶ πεζῇ , πρόφασιν μὲν Ἐγεσταίων ξυμμαχίᾳ καὶ Λεοντίνων κατοικίσει , τὸ δὲ ἀληθὲς Σικελίας ἐπιθυμίᾳ , μάλιστα δὲ τῆς ἡμετέρας πόλεως , ἡγούμενοι , εἰ ταύτην σχοῖεν , ῥᾳδίως καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἕξειν .
For the Athenians, much as you are surprised at it, have set out against us with a large force both for sea and land service, nominally, on account of an alliance with the Segestans, and for the purpose of settling the Leontines, but really through desire for Sicily, and most of all, for our city, thinking that if they get this, they will easily get the rest also.


6.33.3
4265
ὡς οὖν ἐν τάχει παρεσομένων , ὁρᾶτε ἀπὸ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ὅτῳ τρόπῳ κάλλιστα ἀμυνεῖσθε αὐτούς , καὶ μήτε καταφρονήσαντες ἄφαρκτοι ληφθήσεσθε μήτε ἀπιστήσαντες τοῦ ξύμπαντος ἀμελήσετε .
With a conviction, then, that they will quickly be here, consider how with your present resources you may best defend yourselves, and may neither through despising the matter be taken off your guard, nor through disbelieving it neglect the common weal.


6.33.4
4266
εἰ δέ τῳ καὶ πιστά , τὴν τόλμαν αὐτῶν καὶ δύναμιν μὴ ἐκπλαγῇ .
But if, on the other hand, I appear to any one to speak credibly, let him not be struck with consternation at their boldness and power.


6.33.4
4267
οὔτε γὰρ βλάπτειν ἡμᾶς πλείω οἷοί τ’ ἔσονται ἢ πάσχειν , οὔθ’ ὅτι μεγάλῳ στόλῳ ἐπέρχονται , ἀνωφελεῖς , ἀλλὰ πρός τε τοὺς ἄλλους Σικελιώτας πολὺ ἄμεινον ( μᾶλλον γὰρ ἐθελήσουσιν ἐκπλαγέντες ἡμῖν ξυμμαχεῖν ) , καὶ ἢν ἄρα ἢ κατεργασώμεθα αὐτοὺς ἢ ἀπράκτους ὧν ἐφίενται ἀπώσωμεν ( οὐ γὰρ δὴ μὴ τύχωσί γε ὧν προσδέχονται φοβοῦμαι ) , κάλλιστον δὴ ἔργον ἡμῖν ξυμβήσεται , καὶ οὐκ ἀνέλπιστον ἔμοιγε .
For neither will they be able to do us more harm than they receive, nor, because they are coming against us with a great armament, are they on that account without advantage for us; but it is much better with respect to the rest of the Siceliots, (for they will be the more willing, in their consternation, to join our alliance,) and in case of our either defeating them, or repulsing them without their obtaining the objects of their ambition, (for certainly I am not afraid of their gaining what they expect,) it will prove the most glorious achievement for us, and one which, by me at least, is not unexpected.


6.33.5
4268
ὀλίγοι γὰρ δὴ στόλοι μεγάλοι ἢ Ἑλλήνων ἢ βαρβάρων πολὺ ἀπὸ τῆς ἑαυτῶν ἀπάραντες κατώρθωσαν .
For few have been the great armaments, either of Greeks or barbarians, which have gone far from home and proved successful.


6.33.5
4269
οὔτε γὰρ πλείους τῶν ἐνοικούντων καὶ ἀστυγειτόνων ἔρχονται ( πάντα γὰρ ὑπὸ δέους ξυνίσταται ) , ἤν τε δι’ ἀπορίαν τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ἐν ἀλλοτρίᾳ γῇ σφαλῶσι , τοῖς ἐπιβουλευθεῖσιν ὄνομα , κἂν περὶ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς τὰ πλείω πταίσωσιν , ὅμως καταλείπουσιν .
For they come not in greater numbers than the natives of the country and those who live near to it, (since all league together through fear,) and if they fail through want of provisions in a foreign land, even though they fail chiefly through their own fault, they nevertheless leave a proud name to those who were the objects of their attack.


6.33.6
4270
ὅπερ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι αὐτοὶ οὗτοι , τοῦ Μήδου παρὰ λόγον πολλὰ σφαλέντος , ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι ὡς ἐπ’ Ἀθήνας ᾔει ηὐξήθησαν , καὶ ἡμῖν οὐκ ἀνέλπιστον τὸ τοιοῦτο ξυμβῆναι .
Just as these very Athenians, when the Mede, contrary to expectation, was so signally defeated, grew great on the strength of the report, that it was against Athens that he had come. And there is reason for hoping that in our case the result may be the same.


6.34.1
4271
&quot; θαρσοῦντες οὖν τά τε αὐτοῦ παρασκευαζώμεθα καὶ ἐς τοὺς Σικελοὺς πέμποντες τοὺς μὲν μᾶλλον βεβαιωσώμεθα , τοῖς δὲ φιλίαν καὶ ξυμμαχίαν πειρώμεθα ποιεῖσθαι , ἔς τε τὴν ἄλλην Σικελίαν πέμπωμεν πρέσβεις δηλοῦντες ὡς κοινὸς ὁ κίνδυνος , καὶ ἐς τὴν Ἰταλίαν , ὅπως ἢ ξυμμαχίαν ποιώμεθα ἡμῖν ἢ μὴ δέχωνται Ἀθηναίους .
" With good courage, then, let us both make our preparations here, and send to the Sicels, to strengthen the attachment of some of them, and endeavour to enter into friendship and alliance with others; while we despatch envoys to the rest of Sicily, to prove that the danger is common to all; and to Italy, that either we may gain their alliance for ourselves, or they may refuse to receive the Athenians."


6.34.2
4272
δοκεῖ δέ μοι καὶ ἐς Καρχηδόνα ἄμεινον εἶναι πέμψαι ·
I think it better, too, that we should also send to Carthage.


6.34.2
4273
οὐ γὰρ ἀνέλπιστον αὐτοῖς , ἀλλ’ αἰεὶ διὰ φόβου εἰσὶ μή ποτε Ἀθηναῖοι αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ἔλθωσιν , ὥστε τάχ’ ἂν ἴσως νομίσαντες , εἰ τάδε προήσονται , κἂν σφεῖς ἐν πόνῳ εἶναι , ἐθελήσειαν ἡμῖν ἤτοι κρύφα γε ἢ φανερῶς ἢ ἐξ ἑνός γέ του τρόπου ἀμῦναι .
For this is nothing unexpected by them; but they are always in fear that they may some time or other find the Athenians coming against their country; and therefore thinking, perhaps, that if they abandoned these places, they would themselves be brought into trouble, they might be willing to assist us; at least secretly, if not openly; or at any rate in some way or other.


6.34.2
4274
δυνατοὶ δὲ εἰσὶ μάλιστα τῶν νῦν , βουληθέντες ·
And they are more able to do it, if they please, than any men of the present day; for they possess most gold and silver;


6.34.2
4275
χρυσὸν γὰρ καὶ ἄργυρον πλεῖστον κέκτηνται , ὅθεν ὅ τε πόλεμος καὶ τ- ἄλλα εὐπορεῖ .
and it is by means of these that war, like every thing else, prospers.


6.34.3
4276
πέμπωμεν δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα καὶ ἐς Κόρινθον δεόμενοι δεῦρο κατὰ τάχος βοηθεῖν καὶ τὸν ἐκεῖ πόλεμον κινεῖν .
" Let us likewise send to Lacedaemon and Corinth, begging them to come hither to our aid as quickly as possible, and to stir up the war there."


6.34.4
4277
ὃ δὲ μάλιστα ἐγώ τε νομίζω ἐπίκαιρον ὑμεῖς τε διὰ τὸ ξύνηθες ἥσυχον ἥκιστ’ ἂν ὀξέως πείθοισθε , ὅμως εἰρήσεται .
And what I think the most expedient course, though you, through your habitual love of quiet, would be least quickly persuaded to adopt it, shall, notwithstanding that, be mentioned.


6.34.4
4278
Σικελιῶται γὰρ εἰ ἐθέλοιμεν ξύμπαντες , εἰ δὲ μή , ὅτι πλεῖστοι μεθ’ ἡμῶν , καθελκύσαντες ἅπαν τὸ ὑπάρχον ναυτικὸν μετὰ δυοῖν μηνοῖν τροφῆς ἀπαντῆσαι Ἀθηναίοις ἐς Τάραντα καὶ ἄκραν Ἰαπυγίαν , καὶ δῆλον ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς ὅτι οὐ περὶ τῆς Σικελίας πρότερον ἔσται ὁ ἀγὼν ἢ τοῦ ἐκείνους περαιωθῆναι τὸν Ἰόνιον , μάλιστ’ ἂν αὐτοὺς ἐκπλήξαιμεν καὶ ἐς λογισμὸν καταστήσαιμεν ὅτι ὁρμώμεθα μὲν ἐκ φιλίας χώρας φύλακες ( ὑποδέχεται γὰρ ἡμᾶς Τάρας ) , τὸ δὲ πέλαγος αὐτοῖς πολὺ περαιοῦσθαι μετὰ πάσης τῆς παρασκευῆς , χαλεπὸν δὲ διὰ πλοῦ μῆκος ἐν τάξει μεῖναι , καὶ ἡμῖν ἂν εὐεπίθετος εἴη , βραδεῖά τε καὶ κατ’ ὀλίγον προσπίπτουσα .
If then we Siceliots—all in one body, if possible; but if not, as many as possible in concert with us—would launch the whole of our present navy, with two months' provisions, and go to meet the Athenians at Tarentum and the Iapygian foreland, and show them that they will not have to fight about Sicily before they have fought for their own passage over the Ionian Sea; we should strike them with the greatest fear, and set them on considering that we are starting from a friendly country as its guardians, (for Tarentum is ready to receive us,) but that for them the tract of open sea is a wide one to cross with all their armament; which would hardly remain in order through so long a voyage, and would be easily attacked by us, while it came on slowly and in small divisions.


6.34.5
4279
εἰ δ’ αὖ τῷ ταχυναυτοῦντι ἁθροωτέρῳ κουφίσαντες προσβάλοιεν , εἰ μὲν κώπαις χρήσαιντο , ἐπιθοίμεθ’ ἂν κεκμηκόσιν , εἰ δὲ μὴ δοκοίη , ἔστι καὶ ὑποχωρῆσαι ἡμῖν ἐς Τάραντα ·
Then, if they use their oars, we shall fall on them when they are wearied; or if we should not choose to do so, we may also retire to Tarentum:


6.34.5
4280
οἱ δὲ μετ’ ὀλίγων ἐφοδίων ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίᾳ περαιωθέντες ἀποροῖεν ἂν κατὰ χωρία ἐρῆμα , καὶ ἢ μένοντες πολιορκοῖντο ἂν ἢ πειρώμενοι παραπλεῖν τήν τε ἄλλην παρασκευὴν ἀπολείποιεν ἂν καὶ τὰ τῶν πόλεων οὐκ ἂν βέβαια ἔχοντες , εἰ ὑποδέξοιντο , ἀθυμοῖεν .
while they, having crossed with few provisions, on purpose for an engagement, would be at a loss what to do in uninhabited regions; and would either be blockaded, if they remained, or if they attempted to sail along the coast, would abandon the rest of their armament, and would be dispirited, from having no certainty whether the cities would receive them or not.


6.34.6
4281
ὥστ’ ἔγωγε τούτῳ τῷ λογισμῷ ἡγοῦμαι ἀποκλῃομένους αὐτοὺς οὐδ’ ἂν ἀπᾶραι ἀπὸ Κερκύρας , ἀλλ’ ἢ διαβουλευσαμένους καὶ κατασκοπαῖς χρωμένους , ὁπόσοι τ’ ἐσμὲν καὶ ἐν ᾧ χωρίῳ , ἐξωσθῆναι ἂν τῇ ὥρᾳ ἐς χειμῶνα , ἢ καταπλαγέντας τῷ ἀδοκήτῳ καταλῦσαι ἂν τὸν πλοῦν , ἄλλως τε καὶ τοῦ ἐμπειροτάτου τῶν στρατηγῶν , ὡς ἐγὼ ἀκούω , ἄκοντος ἡγουμένου καὶ ἀσμένου ἂν πρόφασιν λαβόντος , εἴ τι ἀξιόχρεων ἀφ’ ἡμῶν ὀφθείη .
" but would either, after deliberating and reconnoitring how many we are, and in what position, be driven on by the season of the year into winter; or, in consternation at the unexpected result, break up the expedition: especially since the most skilful of their generals, as I hear, is taking the command against his will, and would gladly seize an excuse to return, if any considerable resistance were seen on our part. We should be reported too, I am quite sure, as being more than we really are:"


6.34.7
4282
ἀγγελλοίμεθα δ’ ἂν εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι ἐπὶ τὸ πλέον ·
I therefore, for my part, am of opinion, that being deterred by this consideration, they would not so much as put out from Corcyra;


6.34.7
4283
τῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων πρὸς τὰ λεγόμενα καὶ αἱ γνῶμαι ἵστανται , καὶ τοὺς προεπιχειροῦντας ἢ τοῖς γε ἐπιχειροῦσι προδηλοῦντας ὅτι ἀμυνοῦνται μᾶλλον πεφόβηνται , ἰσοκινδύνους ἡγούμενοι .
and in accordance with what is told them are men's feelings also affected; and of those who are beforehand in attacking, or, at any rate, let those who are going to attack them see beforehand that they will defend themselves, they stand in greater fear, considering them equal to the danger. And this would be the case now with the Athenians.


6.34.8
4284
ὅπερ ἂν νῦν Ἀθηναῖοι πάθοιεν .
For they are coming against us with a belief that we shall offer no resistance;


6.34.8
4285
ἐπέρχονται γὰρ ἡμῖν ὡς οὐκ ἀμυνουμένοις , δικαίως κατεγνωκότες ὅτι αὐτοὺς οὐ μετὰ Λακεδαιμονίων ἐφθείρομεν ·
with good reason contemning us, because we did not join the Lacedaemonians in destroying them.


6.34.8
4286
εἰ δ’ ἴδοιεν παρὰ γνώμην τολμήσαντας , τῷ ἀδοκήτῳ μᾶλλον ἂν καταπλαγεῖεν ἢ τῇ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀληθοῦς δυνάμει .
But if they saw us acting with courage beyond their expectation, they would be more dismayed at that unlooked-for result, than at the power which we really possess.


6.34.9
4287
&quot; πείθεσθε οὖν μάλιστα μὲν ταῦτα τολμήσαντες , εἰ δὲ μή , ὅτι τάχιστα τ- ἄλλα ἐς τὸν πόλεμον ἑτοιμάζειν , καὶ παραστῆναι παντὶ τὸ μὲν καταφρονεῖν τοὺς ἐπιόντας ἐν τῶν ἔργων τῇ ἀλκῇ δείκνυσθαι , τὸ δ’ ἤδη τὰς μετὰ φόβου παρασκευὰς ἀσφαλεστάτας νομίσαντας ὡς ἐπὶ κινδύνου πράσσειν χρησιμώτατον ἂν ξυμβῆναι .
Be persuaded, therefore to show this boldness, if possible; but if not, then, as quickly as possible, to get ready all other resources for the war;


6.34.9
4288
οἱ δὲ ἄνδρες καὶ ἐπέρχονται καὶ ἐν πλῷ εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι ἤδη εἰσὶ καὶ ὅσον οὔπω πάρεισιν &quot; .
and to think, every one of you, that contempt for your assailants is best shown by bravery of deeds; but that, for the present, to consider those preparations most safe which are made with a feeling of fear, and to act as in a season of danger, would prove most to your advantage. For those men are both coming against us, and already, I know for certain, on their voyage, and all but here.


6.35.1
4289
καὶ ὁ μὲν Ἑρμοκράτης τοσαῦτα εἶπεν ·
Such was the speech of Hermocrates.


6.35.1
4290
τῶν δὲ Συρακοσίων ὁ δῆμος ἐν πολλῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔριδι ἦσαν , οἱ μὲν ὡς οὐδενὶ ἂν τρόπῳ ἔλθοιεν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐδ’ ἀληθῆ ἐστὶν ἃ λέγει , τοῖς δέ , εἰ καὶ ἔλθοιεν , τί ἂν δράσειαν αὐτοὺς ὅτι οὐκ ἂν μεῖζον ἀντιπάθοιεν .
But the people of Syracuse were at great strife one with another; some maintaining that the Athenians would by no means come, and that what he said was not the truth; others asking what they could do, if they did come, which they would not suffer on a larger scale in return.


6.35.1
4291
ἄλλοι δὲ καὶ πάνυ καταφρονοῦντες ἐς γέλωτα ἔτρεπον τὸ πρᾶγμα .
Others, again, treated the matter with utter contempt, and turned it to ridicule;


6.35.1
4292
ὀλίγον δ’ ἦν τὸ πιστεῦον τῷ Ἑρμοκράτει καὶ φοβούμενον τὸ μέλλον .
while there were but few who believed Hermocrates, and were afraid of what was coming.


6.35.2
4293
παρελθὼν δ’ αὐτοῖς Ἀθηναγόρας , ὃς δήμου τε προστάτης ἦν καὶ ἐν τῷ παρόντι πιθανώτατος τοῖς πολλοῖς , ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
Athenagoras, who was a leader of the people, and most influential with the multitude at the present time, then came forward to them and spoke as follows:


6.36.1
4294
&quot; τοὺς μὲν Ἀθηναίους ὅστις μὴ βούλεται οὕτω κακῶς φρονῆσαι καὶ ὑποχειρίους ἡμῖν γενέσθαι ἐνθάδε ἐλθόντας , ἢ δειλός ἐστιν ἢ τῇ πόλει οὐκ εὔνους ·
With regard to the Athenians, whoever does not wish them to be so senseless, and to be reduced into subjection to us by coming here, is either a coward, or ill affected towards his country.


6.36.1
4295
τοὺς δὲ ἀγγέλλοντας τὰ τοιαῦτα καὶ περιφόβους ὑμᾶς ποιοῦντας τῆς μὲν τόλμης οὐ θαυμάζω , τῆς δὲ ἀξυνεσίας , εἰ μὴ οἴονται ἔνδηλοι εἶναι .
But with regard to those who bring such tidings, and fill you with such excessive fear, I wonder at them, not for their audacity, but for their folly, if they imagine that they are not seen through.


6.36.2
4296
οἱ γὰρ δεδιότες ἰδίᾳ τι βούλονται τὴν πόλιν ἐς ἔκπληξιν καθιστάναι , ὅπως τῷ κοινῷ φόβῳ τὸν σφέτερον ἐπηλυγάζωνται .
For being afraid themselves, they wish to throw the whole city into consternation, in order that they may get their own terror thrown into the shade by the general alarm.


6.36.2
4297
καὶ νῦν αὗται αἱ ἀγγελίαι τοῦτο δύνανται ·
And now this is the real value of these reports:


6.36.2
4298
οὐκ ἀπὸ τ- αὐτομάτου , ἐκ δὲ ἀνδρῶν οἵπερ αἰεὶ τάδε κινοῦσι ξύγκεινται .
they do not arise in a natural way, but are concocted by men who are always raising commotions here.


6.36.3
4299
ὑμεῖς δὲ ἢν εὖ βουλεύησθε , οὐκ ἐξ ὧν οὗτοι ἀγγέλλουσι σκοποῦντες λογιεῖσθε τὰ εἰκότα , ἀλλ’ ἐξ ὧν ἂν ἄνθρωποι δεινοὶ καὶ πολλῶν ἔμπειροι , ὥσπερ ἐγὼ Ἀθηναίους ἀξιῶ , δράσειαν .
But you, if well advised, will not look at and estimate probabilities by the news which these persons bring, but by what men of talent and great experience, as I presume the Athenians are, would be likely to do.


6.36.4
4300
οὐ γὰρ αὐτοὺς εἰκὸς Πελοποννησίους τε ὑπολιπόντας καὶ τὸν ἐκεῖ πόλεμον μήπω βεβαίως καταλελυμένους ἐπ’ ἄλλον πόλεμον οὐκ ἐλάσσω ἑκόντας ἐλθεῖν , ἐπεὶ ἔγωγε ἀγαπᾶν οἴομαι αὐτοὺς ὅτι οὐχ ἡμεῖς ἐπ’ ἐκείνους ἐρχόμεθα , πόλεις τοσαῦται καὶ οὕτω μεγάλαι .
For it is not probable that they, leaving the Peloponnesians behind them, and not having yet brought the war at home to a sure conclusion, should voluntarily come here for another no less arduous; since, in my opinion, they are quite contented that  with so many and so great cities as we have, are not going against


6.37.1
4301
εἰ δὲ δή , ὥσπερ λέγονται , ἔλθοιεν , ἱκανωτέραν ἡγοῦμαι Σικελίαν Πελοποννήσου διαπολεμῆσαι ὅσῳ κατὰ πάντα ἄμεινον ἐξήρτυται , τὴν δὲ ἡμετέραν πόλιν αὐτὴν τῆς νῦν στρατιᾶς , ὥς φασιν , ἐπιούσης , καὶ εἰ δὶς τοσαύτη ἔλθοι , πολὺ κρείσσω εἶναι , οἷς γ’ ἐπίσταμαι οὔθ’ ἵππους ἀκολουθήσοντας , οὐδ’ αὐτόθεν πορισθησομένους εἰ μὴ ὀλίγους τινὰς παρ’ Ἐγεσταίων , οὔθ’ ὁπλίτας ἰσοπληθεῖς τοῖς ἡμετέροις ἐπὶ νεῶν γε ἐλθόντας ( μέγα γὰρ τὸ καὶ αὐταῖς ταῖς ναυσὶ κούφαις τοσοῦτον πλοῦν δεῦρο κομισθῆναι ) , τήν τε ἄλλην παρασκευὴν ὅσην δεῖ ἐπὶ πόλιν τοσήνδε πορισθῆναι , οὐκ ὀλίγην οὖσαν .
"But, indeed, if they should come, as they are said to be coming, I consider Sicily more competent to bring the war to a termination than the Peloponnese, (inasmuch as it is better provided in all respects,) and our city by itself far stronger than the army which is now, as they say, coming against us, even though it came twice as large as it is. For I know that neither will any horses accompany them, or be provided for them here, except some few from the Segestans, nor heavy-armed equal in number to our own, coming, as they must have done, on board ship. For it is a great thing for even the ships themselves, lightly laden, to perform so long a voyage hither; and for all the other provisions required against such a city, (which will be no few,) to be furnished.


6.37.2
4302
ὥστε , παρὰ τοσοῦτον γιγνώσκω , μόλις ἄν μοι δοκοῦσιν , εἰ πόλιν ἑτέραν τοσαύτην ὅσαι Συράκουσαί εἰσιν ἔλθοιεν ἔχοντες καὶ ὅμορον οἰκίσαντες τὸν πόλεμον ποιοῖντο , οὐκ ἂν παντάπασι διαφθαρῆναι , ἦ πού γε δὴ ἐν πάσῃ πολεμίᾳ Σικελίᾳ ( ξυστήσεται γάρ ) στρατοπέδῳ τε ἐκ νεῶν ἱδρυθέντι καὶ ἐκ σκηνιδίων καὶ ἀναγκαίας παρασκευῆς οὐκ ἐπὶ πολὺ ὑπὸ τῶν ἡμετέρων ἱππέων ἐξιόντες .
So far then am I from believing this, that I think if they came with another city as large as Syracuse in their possession, and living there on our borders carried on the war, they would hardly avoid utter ruin:


6.37.2
4303
τό τε ξύμπαν οὐδ’ ἂν κρατῆσαι αὐτοὺς τῆς γῆς ἡγοῦμαι ·
much less then, surely, with the whole of Sicily hostile to them, (for it will league together;) and with an army established in the country from on board ship; and while they are not permitted by our cavalry to advance far from their wretched tents, and such poor equipments as they are compelled to put up with.


6.37.2
4304
τοσούτῳ τὴν ἡμετέραν παρασκευὴν κρείσσω νομίζω .
In short, I do not think they would even effect a landing; so far superior do I consider our forces to be.


6.38.1
4305
&quot; ἀλλὰ ταῦτα , ὥσπερ ἐγὼ λέγω , οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι γιγνώσκοντες τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι σῴζουσι , καὶ ἐνθένδε ἄνδρες οὔτε ὄντα οὔτε ἂν γενόμενα λογοποιοῦσιν , οὓς ἐγὼ οὐ νῦν πρῶτον , ἀλλ’ αἰεὶ ἐπίσταμαι ἤτοι λόγοις γε τοιοῖσδε καὶ ἔτι τούτων κακουργοτέροις ἢ ἔργοις βουλομένους καταπλήξαντας τὸ ὑμέτερον πλῆθος αὐτοὺς τῆς πόλεως ἄρχειν .
"But the Athenians, as I tell you, being aware of this, are engaged, I am well assured, in preserving their own possessions; and it is persons here that are making up these stories of what neither is, nor could ever be, the case.


6.38.2
4306
καὶ δέδοικα μέντοι μήποτε πολλὰ πειρῶντες καὶ κατορθώσωσιν ·
And I am not now for the first time convinced of them, but have ever been so, that they wish to terrify your populace by such tales as these, and still more wicked ones, if not even by deeds;


6.38.2
4307
ἡμεῖς δὲ κακοί , πρὶν ἐν τῷ παθεῖν ὦμεν , προφυλάξασθαί τε καὶ αἰσθόμενοι ἐπεξελθεῖν .
and so themselves to have the rule of the city. And in truth I am afraid, lest some time or other, by making many attempts, they should even succeed; while we are ill disposed, before we are in the act of suffering, to take precautionary measures against them, and after finding them out, to proceed against them.


6.38.3
4308
τοιγάρτοι δι’ αὐτὰ ἡ πόλις ἡμῶν ὀλιγάκις μὲν ἡσυχάζει , στάσεις δὲ πολλὰς καὶ ἀγῶνας οὐ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους πλέονας ἢ πρὸς αὑτὴν ἀναιρεῖται , τυραννίδας δὲ ἔστιν ὅτε καὶ δυναστείας ἀδίκους .
And so by these means our city is seldom at rest, but is involved in many feuds and conflicts—not more frequently with its enemies than with itself—and sometimes in tyrannies and unprincipled cabals. But I will endeavour, if only you will follow my advice, to let none of these things occur in our time;


6.38.4
4309
ὧν ἐγὼ πειράσομαι , ἤν γε ὑμεῖς ἐθέλητε ἕπεσθαι , μήποτε ἐφ’ ἡμῶν τι περιιδεῖν γενέσθαι , ὑμᾶς μὲν τοὺς πολλοὺς πείθων , τοὺς δὲ τὰ τοιαῦτα μηχανωμένους κολάζων , μὴ μόνον αὐτοφώρους ( χαλεπὸν γὰρ ἐπιτυγχάνειν ) , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὧν βούλονται μέν , δύνανται δ’ οὔ ( τὸν γὰρ ἐχθρὸν οὐχ ὧν δρᾷ μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς διανοίας προαμύνεσθαι χρή , εἴπερ καὶ μὴ προφυλαξάμενός τις προπείσεται ) , τοὺς δ’ αὖ ὀλίγους τὰ μὲν ἐλέγχων , τὰ δὲ φυλάσσων , τὰ δὲ καὶ διδάσκων ·
by convincing you who form the mass of the people, and by chastising those who plot such things; not only when convicted in the act, (for it is difficult so to catch them,) but also for what they have the wish, though not the power, to do.


6.38.4
4310
μάλιστα γὰρ δοκῶ ἄν μοι οὕτως ἀποτρέπειν τῆς κακουργίας .
For we must avenge ourselves on our enemy, not only for what he does, but beforehand also, for his intention to do it; inasmuch as if we are not first in guarding against him, we shall be first in suffering. With regard to the oligarchs, on the other hand, I shall reprove them on some points, watch them on others, and warn them on others; for in this way I think I shall best deter them from their evil practices.


6.38.5
4311
καὶ δῆτα , ὃ πολλάκις ἐσκεψάμην , τί καὶ βούλεσθε , ὦ νεώτεροι ;
And, indeed, what is it (a question which I have often asked) that ye really wish, ye young men?


6.38.5
4312
πότερον ἄρχειν ἤδη ;
Is it to enjoy power at once?


6.38.5
4313
ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἔννομον ·
But that is not lawful;


6.38.5
4314
ὁ δὲ νόμος ἐκ τοῦ μὴ δύνασθαι ὑμᾶς μᾶλλον ἢ δυναμένους ἐτέθη ἀτιμάζειν .
and that law was so enacted in consequence of your incompetency, rather than with a wish to degrade you when competent for the task.


6.38.5
4315
ἀλλὰ δὴ μὴ μετὰ πολλῶν ἰσονομεῖσθαι ;
Well then, is it to avoid being under the same laws with the people at large?


6.38.5
4316
καὶ πῶς δίκαιον τοὺς αὐτοὺς μὴ τῶν αὐτῶν ἀξιοῦσθαι ;
And how then is it right for the same people not to be thought worthy of the same privileges?


6.39.1
4317
φήσει τις δημοκρατίαν οὔτε ξυνετὸν οὔτ’ ἴσον εἶναι , τοὺς δ’ ἔχοντας τὰ χρήματα καὶ ἄρχειν ἄριστα βελτίστους .
"Some one will say, that a democracy is neither a sensible nor an equitable thing, but that those who have property are also most competent to rule best.


6.39.1
4318
ἐγὼ δέ φημι πρῶτα μὲν δῆμον ξύμπαν ὠνομάσθαι , ὀλιγαρχίαν δὲ μέρος , ἔπειτα φύλακας μὲν ἀρίστους εἶναι χρημάτων τοὺς πλουσίους , βουλεῦσαι δ’ ἂν βέλτιστα τοὺς ξυνετούς , κρῖναι δ’ ἂν ἀκούσαντας ἄριστα τοὺς πολλούς , καὶ ταῦτα ὁμοίως καὶ κατὰ μέρη καὶ ξύμπαντα ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ ἰσομοιρεῖν .
But I say, in the first place, that 'democracy' is a name for all, but 'oligarchy' for only a part; and, in the second place, that though the rich are the best guardians of property, the intelligent would be the best counsellors, and the mass of the people the best judges after hearing measures discussed;


6.39.2
4319
ὀλιγαρχία δὲ τῶν μὲν κινδύνων τοῖς πολλοῖς μεταδίδωσι , τῶν δ’ ὠφελίμων οὐ πλεονεκτεῖ μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύμπαντ’ ἀφελομένη ἔχει ·
and that all these things, both severally and collectively, have their due share allotted to them in a democracy.


6.39.2
4320
ἃ ὑμῶν οἵ τε δυνάμενοι καὶ οἱ νέοι προθυμοῦνται , ἀδύνατα ἐν μεγάλῃ πόλει κατασχεῖν .
An oligarchy, on the other hand, admits, indeed, the many to a share of dangers, but of advantages it not only enjoys the larger part, but even takes away and keeps the whole.


6.39.2
4321
&quot; ἀλλ’ ἔτι καὶ νῦν , ὦ πάντων ἀξυνετώτατοι , εἰ μὴ μανθάνετε κακὰ σπεύδοντες , ἢ ἀμαθέστατοί ἐστε ὧν ἐγὼ οἶδα Ἑλλήνων , ἢ ἀδικώτατοι , εἰ εἰδότες τολμᾶτε .
And this is what the powerful and young among you desire—a thing impossible to attain in a great city.


6.40.1
4322
ἀλλ’ ἤτοι μαθόντες γε ἢ μεταγνόντες τὸ τῆς πόλεως ξύμπασι κοινὸν αὔξετε , ἡγησάμενοι τοῦτο μὲν ἂν καὶ ἴσον καὶ πλέον οἱ ἀγαθοὶ ὑμῶν ἤπερ τὸ τῆς πόλεως πλῆθος μετασχεῖν , εἰ δ’ ἄλλα βουλήσεσθε , καὶ τοῦ παντὸς κινδυνεῦσαι στερηθῆναι ·
"Nay then at length, even now, O ye dullest of all men—(for of all the Greeks I know, are you either most senseless, if you are not sensible that you are coveting evil things; or most unprincipled, if you know it, and still dare to pursue them:)—nay then, I say, either acquire that knowledge, or change those principles, and so advance the interest of the city, which is the common interest of all.


6.40.1
4323
καὶ τῶν τοιῶνδε ἀγγελιῶν ὡς πρὸς αἰσθανομένους καὶ μὴ ἐπιτρέψοντας ἀπαλλάγητε .
For consider, that those who are good among you will share that in an equal, or even greater degree, than the mass of the people in the city;


6.40.2
4324
ἡ γὰρ πόλις ἥδε , καὶ εἰ ἔρχονται Ἀθηναῖοι , ἀμυνεῖται αὐτοὺς ἀξίως αὑτῆς , καὶ στρατηγοί εἰσιν ἡμῖν οἳ σκέψονται αὐτά ·
but that if you wish any thing else, you run a risk of being deprived of all.


6.40.2
4325
καὶ εἰ μή τι αὐτῶν ἀληθές ἐστιν , ὥσπερ οὐκ οἴομαι , οὐ πρὸς τὰς ὑμετέρας ἀγγελίας καταπλαγεῖσα καὶ ἑλομένη ὑμᾶς ἄρχοντας αὐθαίρετον δουλείαν ἐπιβαλεῖται , αὐτὴ δ’ ἐφ’ αὑτῆς σκοποῦσα τούς τε λόγους ἀφ’ ὑμῶν ὡς ἔργα δυναμένους κρινεῖ καὶ τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν ἐλευθερίαν οὐχὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἀκούειν ἀφαιρεθήσεται , ἐκ δὲ τοῦ ἔργῳ φυλασσομένη μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν πειράσεται σῴζειν &quot; .
And have done with such reports as these, knowing that they are brought to those who are aware of, and will not tolerate, your designs. For this city, even if the Athenians are coming, will resist them in a manner worthy of itself; and we have generals who will look to these matters. And if none of the reports be true, (which is my opinion,) it will not lay a voluntary slavery on itself, by being panic-struck at your intelligence, and by choosing you as its rulers; but will look at the circumstances itself, and consider the words spoken by you as equivalent to deeds; and will not be deprived of its present liberty by listening to you, but will endeavour to preserve it by being cautious in its actions, and not allowing you to go unpunished."


6.41.1
4326
τοιαῦτα δὲ Ἀθηναγόρας εἶπεν .
To this effect spoke Athenagoras.


6.41.1
4327
τῶν δὲ στρατηγῶν εἷς ἀναστὰς ἄλλον μὲν οὐδένα ἔτι εἴασε παρελθεῖν , αὐτὸς δὲ πρὸς τὰ παρόντα ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
One of the generals then rose up, and would no longer permit any one else to come forward, but himself spoke on the subject before them to the following effect:


6.41.2
4328
&quot; διαβολὰς μὲν οὐ σῶφρον οὔτε λέγειν τινὰς ἐς ἀλλήλους οὔτε τοὺς ἀκούοντας ἀποδέχεσθαι , πρὸς δὲ τὰ ἐσαγγελλόμενα μᾶλλον ὁρᾶν , ὅπως εἷς τε ἕκαστος καὶ ἡ ξύμπασα πόλις καλῶς τοὺς ἐπιόντας παρασκευασόμεθα ἀμύνεσθαι .
" It is neither prudent for any parties to utter calumnies against each other, nor for those who hear them to admit them; but rather to see, with regard to the intelligence brought to us, how we may prepare, both each man severally and the whole city together, to defend ourselves well against the invaders."


6.41.3
4329
καὶ ἢν ἄρα μηδὲν δεήσῃ , οὐδεμία βλάβη τοῦ τε τὸ κοινὸν κοσμηθῆναι καὶ ἵπποις καὶ ὅπλοις καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις οἷς ὁ πόλεμος ἀγάλλεται ( τὴν δ’ ἐπιμέλειαν καὶ ἐξέτασιν αὐτῶν ἡμεῖς ἕξομεν ) , καὶ τῶν πρὸς τὰς πόλεις διαπομπῶν ἅμα ἔς τε κατασκοπὴν καὶ ἤν τι ἄλλο φαίνηται ἐπιτήδειον .
" And even supposing it not to be required, there is no harm, at any rate, in the state being equipped with horses, and arms, and every thing else in which war rejoices."


6.41.4
4330
τὰ δὲ καὶ ἐπιμεμελήμεθα ἤδη , καὶ ὅτι ἂν αἰσθώμεθα ἐς ὑμᾶς οἴσομεν &quot; .
"And we ourselves will undertake to attend to and examine these things, and to send round to the cities, both for observation, and whatever else may appear to be expedient.


6.41.4
4331
καὶ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι τοσαῦτα εἰπόντος τοῦ στρατηγοῦ διελύθησαν ἐκ τοῦ ξυλλόγου .
To some of them, indeed, we have already attended; and whatever we discover, we will lay before you." After the general had said thus much, the Syracusans departed from the assembly.


6.42.1
4332
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἤδη ἐν τῇ Κερκύρᾳ αὐτοί τε καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἅπαντες ἦσαν .
Now the Athenians were by this time at Corcyra, themselves and all their allies.


6.42.1
4333
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ἐπεξέτασιν τοῦ στρατεύματος καὶ ξύνταξιν , ὥσπερ ἔμελλον ὁρμιεῖσθαί τε καὶ στρατοπεδεύεσθαι , οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἐποιήσαντο , καὶ τρία μέρη νείμαντες ἓν ἑκάστῳ ἐκλήρωσαν , ἵνα μήτε ἅμα πλέοντες ἀπορῶσιν ὕδατος καὶ λιμένων καὶ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ἐν ταῖς καταγωγαῖς , πρός τε τ- ἄλλα εὐκοσμότεροι καὶ ῥᾴους ἄρχειν ὦσι , κατὰ τέλη στρατηγῷ προστεταγμένοι ·
And in the first place, the generals reviewed the armament a second time, and made their dispositions, as they were to come to their moorings, and to form their camp; making three squadrons, and allotting one to each of their body, that they might not, by sailing in company, be at a loss for water, and ports, and provisions, on their touching any where; and that they might in other respects be more orderly and easy to control, by being put under a particular commander, according to the several squadrons.


6.42.2
4334
ἔπειτα δὲ προύπεμψαν καὶ ἐς τὴν Ἰταλίαν καὶ Σικελίαν τρεῖς ναῦς εἰσομένας αἵτινες σφᾶς τῶν πόλεων δέξονται .
They next sent forward three ships to Italy and Sicily, to ascertain which of the cities would receive them;


6.42.2
4335
καὶ εἴρητο αὐταῖς προαπαντᾶν , ὅπως ἐπιστάμενοι καταπλέωσιν .
with orders to come out again and meet them, that they might know this when they put in.


6.43.1
4336
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα τοσῇδε ἤδη τῇ παρασκευῇ Ἀθηναῖοι ἄραντες ἐκ τῆς Κερκύρας ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν ἐπεραιοῦντο , τριήρεσι μὲν ταῖς πάσαις τέσσαρσι καὶ τριάκοντα καὶ ἑκατόν , καὶ δυοῖν Ῥοδίοιν πεντηκοντόροιν ( τούτων Ἀττικαὶ μὲν ἦσαν ἑκατόν , ὧν αἱ μὲν ἑξήκοντα ταχεῖαι , αἱ δ’ ἄλλαι στρατιώτιδες , τὸ δὲ ἄλλο ναυτικὸν Χίων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων ) , ὁπλίταις δὲ τοῖς ξύμπασιν ἑκατὸν καὶ πεντακισχιλίοις ( καὶ τούτων Ἀθηναίων μὲν αὐτῶν ἦσαν πεντακόσιοι μὲν καὶ χίλιοι ἐκ καταλόγου , ἑπτακόσιοι δὲ θῆτες ἐπιβάται τῶν νεῶν , ξύμμαχοι δὲ οἱ ἄλλοι ξυνεστράτευον , οἱ μὲν τῶν ὑπηκόων , οἱ δ’ Ἀργείων πεντακόσιοι καὶ Μαντινέων καὶ μισθοφόρων πεντήκοντα καὶ διακόσιοι ) , τοξόταις δὲ τοῖς πᾶσιν ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ τετρακοσίοις ( καὶ τούτων Κρῆτες οἱ ὀγδοήκοντα ἦσαν ) καὶ σφενδονήταις Ῥοδίων ἑπτακοσίοις , καὶ Μεγαρεῦσι ψιλοῖς φυγάσιν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατόν , καὶ ἱππαγωγῷ μιᾷ τριάκοντα ἀγούσῃ ἱππέας .
After this, the Athenians at length weighed anchor, and proceeded to cross over from Corcyra to Sicily, with the following force; viz.—a hundred and thirty-four triremes, in all, and two Rhodian fifty-oared galleys; (a hundred of these were Athenian vessels, sixty of which were fast sailers, the rest troop ships; the remainder of the fleet being composed of Chians, and the other allies;) of heavy-armed, in all, five thousand one hundred, (of which there were raised by the Athenians themselves fifteen hundred, and seven hundred Thetes serving as Epibatae on board the ships; the rest of those who joined the expedition being allies, some of them sent by their subjects, others by the Argives, to the number of five hundred, with two hundred and fifty Mantineans, who were also mercenaries;) of archers, in all, four hundred and eighty, (eighty of which were Cretans;) of Rhodian slingers, seven hundred; of light-armed Megareans, who were exiles, one hundred and twenty; and one horse transport, carrying thirty horses.


6.44.1
4337
τοσαύτη ἡ πρώτη παρασκευὴ πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον διέπλει .
Such was the amount of the first armament which sailed over for the war.


6.44.1
4338
τούτοις δὲ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἄγουσαι ὁλκάδες μὲν τριάκοντα σιταγωγοί , καὶ τοὺς σιτοποιοὺς ἔχουσαι καὶ λιθολόγους καὶ τέκτονας καὶ ὅσα ἐς τειχισμὸν ἐργαλεῖα , πλοῖα δὲ ἑκατόν , ἃ ἐξ ἀνάγκης μετὰ τῶν ὁλκάδων ξυνέπλει ·
For these troops thirty ships of burden, laden with corn, carried provisions, with the bakers, stone-masons, carpenters, and all the tools for building fortifications; and also one hundred boats, which, together with the ships of burden, were pressed into the service;


6.44.1
4339
πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα πλοῖα καὶ ὁλκάδες ἑκούσιοι ξυνηκολούθουν τῇ στρατιᾷ ἐμπορίας ἕνεκα ·
while many other boats and ships of burden followed the armament voluntarily, for purposes of commerce;


6.44.1
4340
ἃ τότε πάντα ἐκ τῆς Κερκύρας ξυνδιέβαλλε τὸν Ἰόνιον κόλπον .
all of which proceeded at that time to cross the Ionian Gulf from Corcyra.


6.44.2
4341
καὶ προσβαλοῦσα ἡ πᾶσα παρασκευὴ πρός τε ἄκραν Ἰαπυγίαν καὶ πρὸς Τάραντα καὶ ὡς ἕκαστοι ηὐπόρησαν , παρεκομίζοντο τὴν Ἰταλίαν , τῶν μὲν πόλεων οὐ δεχομένων αὐτοὺς ἀγορᾷ οὐδὲ ἄστει , ὕδατι δὲ καὶ ὅρμῳ , Τάραντος δὲ καὶ Λοκρῶν οὐδὲ τούτοις , ἕως ἀφίκοντο ἐς Ῥήγιον τῆς Ἰταλίας ἀκρωτήριον .
When the whole armament had made the coast at the Iapygian foreland, and Tarentum, and as they severally could, they sailed along the coast of Italy, as the cities did not afford them a market, or the protection of their walls, but only water and anchorage, (and Tarentum and Locri not even these,) until they came to Rhegium, a promontory of Italy.


6.44.3
4342
καὶ ἐνταῦθα ἤδη ἡθροίζοντο , καὶ ἔξω τῆς πόλεως , ὡς αὐτοὺς ἔσω οὐκ ἐδέχοντο , στρατόπεδόν τε κατεσκευάσαντο ἐν τῷ τῆς Ἀρτέμιδος ἱερῷ , οὗ αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀγορὰν παρεῖχον , καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἀνελκύσαντες ἡσύχασαν .
There they at once mustered, and pitched a camp outside the city, (as they would not receive them within the walls,) in the sacred enclosure of Diana, where they afforded them a market; and having drawn up their ships ashore, they remained quiet.


6.44.3
4343
καὶ πρός τε τοὺς Ῥηγίνους λόγους ἐποιήσαντο , ἀξιοῦντες Χαλκιδέας ὄντας Χαλκιδεῦσιν οὖσι Λεοντίνοις βοηθεῖν ·
They then entered into communication with the Rhegians, calling upon them, as Chalcidians, to assist the Leontines, who were Chalcidians also.


6.44.3
4344
οἱ δὲ οὐδὲ μεθ’ ἑτέρων ἔφασαν ἔσεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ὅτι ἂν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἰταλιώταις ξυνδοκῇ , τοῦτο ποιήσειν .
They, however, said that they would join neither party, but whatever the rest of the Italiots should collectively determine, that they would do.


6.44.4
4345
οἱ δὲ πρὸς τὰ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ πράγματα ἐσκόπουν ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἄριστα προσοίσονται ·
The Athenians then turned their attention to the state of things in Sicily, considering in what way they would best deal with them;


6.44.4
4346
καὶ τὰς πρόπλους ναῦς ἐκ τῆς Ἐγέστης ἅμα προσέμενον , βουλόμενοι εἰδέναι περὶ τῶν χρημάτων εἰ ἔστιν ἃ ἔλεγον ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις οἱ ἄγγελοι .
and at the same time were waiting for the arrival from Segesta of the ships which had been sent on in advance; wishing to know respecting the money, whether there were such a sum as the messengers stated at Athens.


6.45.1
4347
τοῖς δὲ Συρακοσίοις ἐν τούτῳ πολλαχόθεν τε ἤδη καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κατασκόπων σαφῆ ἠγγέλλετο ὅτι ἐν Ῥηγίῳ αἱ νῆές εἰσι , καὶ ὡς ἐπὶ τούτοις παρεσκευάζοντο πάσῃ τῇ γνώμῃ καὶ οὐκέτι ἠπίστουν .
To the Syracusans, in the mean time, reports were being brought from all quarters, and from those who had been sent by them to reconnoitre came positive intelligence that the ships were at Rhegium;


6.45.1
4348
καὶ ἔς τε τοὺς Σικελοὺς περιέπεμπον , ἔνθα μὲν φύλακας , πρὸς δὲ τοὺς πρέσβεις , καὶ ἐς τὰ περιπόλια τὰ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ φρουρὰς ἐσεκόμιζον , τά τε ἐν τῇ πόλει ὅπλων ἐξετάσει καὶ ἵππων ἐσκόπουν εἰ ἐντελῆ ἐστί , καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὡς ἐπὶ ταχεῖ πολέμῳ καὶ ὅσον οὐ παρόντι καθίσταντο .
and on the belief of this, they began to make preparations with all their heart, and were no longer incredulous. Accordingly they sent about to the Sicels, in some cases, guards; in others, ambassadors; and were putting garrisons into the stations of the in their country; while in their city they were seeing if the equipments were complete, by examining arms and horses; and were settling every thing else, in expectation of a war that was quickly coming on them, and all but present.


6.46.1
4349
αἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Ἐγέστης τρεῖς νῆες αἱ πρόπλοι παραγίγνονται τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐς τὸ Ῥήγιον , ἀγγέλλουσαι ὅτι τ- ἄλλα μὲν οὐκ ἔστι χρήματα ἃ ὑπέσχοντο , τριάκοντα δὲ τάλαντα μόνα φαίνεται .
Now the three ships sent on in advance came from Segesta to the Athenians at Rhegium, with tidings that the other money which they had promised was not there, but that only thirty talents were to be seen.


6.46.2
4350
καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ εὐθὺς ἐν ἀθυμίᾳ ἦσαν , ὅτι αὐτοῖς τοῦτό τε πρῶτον ἀντεκεκρούκει καὶ οἱ Ῥηγῖνοι οὐκ ἐθελήσαντες ξυστρατεύειν , οὓς πρῶτον ἤρξαντο πείθειν καὶ εἰκὸς ἦν μάλιστα , Λεοντίνων τε ξυγγενεῖς ὄντας καὶ σφίσιν αἰεὶ ἐπιτηδείους .
The generals then were immediately in a state of great despondency, because this their first hope had disappointed them; as had the Rhegians also, by their unwillingness to join their standard—the people they had first attempted to persuade, and for whom it was most natural to assist them, as they were of the same race as the Leontines, and always favourably disposed towards themselves.


6.46.2
4351
καὶ τῷ μὲν Νικίᾳ προσδεχομένῳ ἦν τὰ παρὰ τῶν Ἐγεσταίων , τοῖν δὲ ἑτέροιν καὶ ἀλογώτερα .
Nicias, indeed, was prepared for the tidings from the Segestans, but by the other two it was quite unexpected.


6.46.3
4352
οἱ δὲ Ἐγεσταῖοι τοιόνδε τι ἐξετεχνήσαντο τότε ὅτε οἱ πρῶτοι πρέσβεις τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἦλθον αὐτοῖς ἐς τὴν κατασκοπὴν τῶν χρημάτων .
For the Segestans had recourse to the following contrivance, at the time when the first envoys of the Athenians came to them to see the state of their funds.


6.46.3
4353
ἔς τε τὸ ἐν Ἔρυκι ἱερὸν τῆς Ἀφροδίτης ἀγαγόντες αὐτοὺς ἐπέδειξαν τὰ ἀναθήματα , φιάλας τε καὶ οἰνοχόας καὶ θυμιατήρια καὶ ἄλλην κατασκευὴν οὐκ ὀλίγην , ἃ ὄντα ἀργυρᾶ πολλῷ πλείω τὴν ὄψιν ἀπ’ ὀλίγης δυνάμεως χρημάτων παρείχετο ·
They took them to the temple of Venus at Eryx, and showed them the treasures deposited there, consisting of bowls, wine-ladles, censers, and other articles of furniture in no small quantity; which being made of silver, presented, with a value really trifling, a much greater show of wealth.


6.46.3
4354
καὶ ἰδίᾳ ξενίσεις ποιούμενοι τῶν τριηριτῶν τά τε ἐξ αὐτῆς Ἐγέστης ἐκπώματα καὶ χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀργυρᾶ ξυλλέξαντες καὶ τὰ ἐκ τῶν ἐγγὺς πόλεων καὶ Φοινικικῶν καὶ Ἑλληνίδων αἰτησάμενοι ἐσέφερον ἐς τὰς ἑστιάσεις ὡς οἰκεῖα ἕκαστοι .
And in their private receptions of the triremes' crews, having collected the cups both of gold and silver that were in Segesta itself, and borrowed those in the neighbouring cities, whether Phoenician or Grecian, they each brought them to the entertainments, as their own.


6.46.4
4355
καὶ πάντων ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ τοῖς αὐτοῖς χρωμένων καὶ πανταχοῦ πολλῶν φαινομένων μεγάλην τὴν ἔκπληξιν τοῖς ἐκ τῶν τριήρων Ἀθηναίοις παρεῖχε , καὶ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας διεθρόησαν ὡς χρήματα πολλὰ ἴδοιεν .
And thus, as all used pretty nearly the same, and great numbers of them were every where seen, it created much astonishment in the Athenians from the triremes;


6.46.5
4356
καὶ οἱ μὲν αὐτοί τε ἀπατηθέντες καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους τότε πείσαντες , ἐπειδὴ διῆλθεν ὁ λόγος ὅτι οὐκ εἴη ἐν τῇ Ἐγέστῃ τὰ χρήματα , πολλὴν τὴν αἰτίαν εἶχον ὑπὸ τῶν στρατιωτῶν ·
and on their arrival at Athens they spread it abroad that they had seen great wealth.


6.46.5
4357
οἱ δὲ στρατηγοὶ πρὸς τὰ παρόντα ἐβουλεύοντο .
Those, then, who had been themselves thus outwitted, and had at that time persuaded the rest, were severely blamed by the soldiers, when the report went abroad that there was not at Segesta the money they had expected.


6.47.1
4358
καὶ Νικίου μὲν ἦν γνώμη πλεῖν ἐπὶ Σελινοῦντα πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ , ἐφ’ ὅπερ μάλιστα ἐπέμφθησαν , καὶ ἢν μὲν παρέχωσι χρήματα παντὶ τῷ στρατεύματι Ἐγεσταῖοι , πρὸς ταῦτα βουλεύεσθαι , εἰ δὲ μή , ταῖς ἑξήκοντα ναυσίν , ὅσασπερ ᾐτήσαντο , ἀξιοῦν διδόναι αὐτοὺς τροφήν , καὶ παραμείναντας Σελινουντίους ἢ βίᾳ ἢ ξυμβάσει διαλλάξαι αὐτοῖς , καὶ οὕτω παραπλεύσαντας τὰς ἄλλας πόλεις καὶ ἐπιδείξαντας μὲν τὴν δύναμιν τῆς Ἀθηναίων πόλεως , δηλώσαντας δὲ τὴν ἐς τοὺς φίλους καὶ ξυμμάχους προθυμίαν , ἀποπλεῖν οἴκαδε , ἢν μή τι δι’ ὀλίγου καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀδοκήτου ἢ Λεοντίνους οἷοί τε ὦσιν ὠφελῆσαι ἢ τῶν ἄλλων τινὰ πόλεων προσαγαγέσθαι , καὶ τῇ πόλει δαπανῶντας τὰ οἰκεῖα μὴ κινδυνεύειν .
The generals now took counsel on the present state of affairs. The opinion of Nicias was, that they should sail to Selinus with all their forces, that being the object for which they had, most of all, been sent: and in case of the Segestans supplying money for the whole armament, that then they should determine accordingly; otherwise, that they should beg them to give provisions for their sixty ships, the number which they had asked for; and remaining there should bring the Selinuntines to terms with them, either by force or by treaty; and so, after coasting along by the other cities, and displaying the power of the Athenian state, as well as proving their zeal in the cause of their friends and allies, they should sail back home;—(unless they should be able, on a sudden, and without expecting it, either to do the Leontines service, or to bring over some of the other cities;)—and not expose their state to danger by spending its own resources.


6.48.1
4359
Ἀλκιβιάδης δὲ οὐκ ἔφη χρῆναι τοσαύτῃ δυνάμει ἐκπλεύσαντας αἰσχρῶς καὶ ἀπράκτους ἀπελθεῖν , ἀλλ’ ἔς τε τὰς πόλεις ἐπικηρυκεύεσθαι πλὴν Σελινοῦντος καὶ Συρακουσῶν τὰς ἄλλας , καὶ πειρᾶσθαι καὶ τοὺς Σικελοὺς τοὺς μὲν ἀφιστάναι ἀπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων , τοὺς δὲ φίλους ποιεῖσθαι , ἵνα σῖτον καὶ στρατιὰν ἔχωσι , πρῶτον δὲ πείθειν Μεσσηνίους ( ἐν πόρῳ γὰρ μάλιστα καὶ προσβολῇ εἶναι αὐτοὺς τῆς Σικελίας , καὶ λιμένα καὶ ἐφόρμησιν τῇ στρατιᾷ ἱκανωτάτην ἔσεσθαι ) ·
Alcibiades, on the other hand, said that they ought not, after sailing from home with so large a force, to return with dishonour and without effecting their purpose; but to send heralds to all the other cities, except Selinus and Syracuse, and endeavour also to get some of the Sicels to revolt from the Syracusans, and to gain the friendship of others amongst them, with a view to obtaining corn and troops; but first of all to win over the Messanians; (for they lay just in the passage and approach to Sicily, and there would be a harbour for them there, and the most suitable station for observing the enemy.)


6.48.1
4360
προσαγαγομένους δὲ τὰς πόλεις , εἰδότας μεθ’ ὧν τις πολεμήσει , οὕτως ἤδη Συρακούσαις καὶ Σελινοῦντι ἐπιχειρεῖν , ἢν μὴ οἱ μὲν Ἐγεσταίοις ξυμβαίνωσιν , οἱ δὲ Λεοντίνους ἐῶσι κατοικίζειν .
When, then, they had brought over the cities, and knew with whose assistance they would carry on the war, then they should attack Syracuse and Selinus, if the latter did not come to terms with Segesta, and the former permit them to settle the Leontines.


6.49.1
4361
Λάμαχος δὲ ἄντικρυς ἔφη χρῆναι πλεῖν ἐπὶ Συρακούσας καὶ πρὸς τῇ πόλει ὡς τάχιστα τὴν μάχην ποιεῖσθαι , ἕως ἔτι ἀπαράσκευοί τε εἰσὶ καὶ μάλιστα ἐκπεπληγμένοι .
Lamachus, again, urged that they ought to sail straight to Syracuse, and immediately fight the battle under the walls of the city, while the inhabitants were most unprepared and panic-struck. For every armament was most formidable in the first instance;


6.49.2
4362
τὸ γὰρ πρῶτον πᾶν στράτευμα δεινότατον εἶναι ·
but if it spent much time before coming into sight, men grew bold again in spirit, and felt more contempt for it even on its appearance.


6.49.2
4363
ἢν δὲ χρονίσῃ πρὶν ἐς ὄψιν ἐλθεῖν , τῇ γνώμῃ ἀναθαρσοῦντας ἀνθρώπους καὶ τῇ ὄψει καταφρονεῖν μᾶλλον .
If, then, they attacked them on a sudden, while they were still with terror looking for them, they would gain the most decided advantage over them, and strike fear into them in every way; by their sight of the forces, (for they would appear most numerous at the present time,) by their expectation of what they would suffer, and, most of all, by the immediate peril of the engagement.


6.49.2
4364
αἰφνίδιοι δὲ ἢν προσπέσωσιν , ἕως ἔτι περιδεεῖς προσδέχονται , μάλιστ’ ἂν σφεῖς περιγενέσθαι καὶ κατὰ πάντα ἂν αὐτοὺς ἐκφοβῆσαι , τῇ τε ὄψει ( πλεῖστοι γὰρ ἂν νῦν φανῆναι ) καὶ τῇ προσδοκίᾳ ὧν πείσονται , μάλιστα δ’ ἂν τῷ αὐτίκα κινδύνῳ τῆς μάχης .
It was probable, too, that many would be surprised outside the city in consequence of their not believing that they would come;


6.49.3
4365
εἰκὸς δὲ εἶναι καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς πολλοὺς ἀποληφθῆναι ἔξω διὰ τὸ ἀπιστεῖν σφᾶς μὴ ἥξειν , καὶ ἐσκομιζομένων αὐτῶν τὴν στρατιὰν οὐκ ἀπορήσειν χρημάτων , ἢν πρὸς τῇ πόλει κρατοῦσα καθέζηται .
or, if they were now carrying in their effects, yet the army would be in no want of property, if it sat down in superior force before the city. And so the rest of the Siceliots would then the more shrink from entering into alliance with the Syracusans, and join the Athenians;


6.49.4
4366
τούς τε ἄλλους Σικελιώτας οὕτως ἤδη μᾶλλον καὶ ἐκείνοις οὐ ξυμμαχήσειν καὶ σφίσι προσιέναι καὶ οὐ διαμελλήσειν περισκοποῦντας ὁπότεροι κρατήσουσιν .
and would not put off, while they waited to see which party would be the stronger.


6.49.4
4367
ναύσταθμον δὲ ἐπαναχωρήσαντας καὶ ἐφορμηθέντας Μέγαρα ἔφη χρῆναι ποιεῖσθαι , ἃ ἦν ἐρῆμα , ἀπέχοντα Συρακουσῶν οὔτε πλοῦν πολὺν οὔτε ὁδόν .
As for a naval station, he said that after retiring [from before Syracuse,] and bringing their ships to anchor, they should establish one at Megara; which was an uninhabited place, at no great distance from Syracuse either by sea or land.


6.50.1
4368
Λάμαχος μὲν ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὅμως προσέθετο καὶ αὐτὸς τῇ Ἀλκιβιάδου γνώμῃ .
Though Lamachus spoke to this effect, he nevertheless gave his support to the opinion of Alcibiades.


6.50.1
4369
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο Ἀλκιβιάδης τῇ αὑτοῦ νηὶ διαπλεύσας ἐς Μεσσήνην καὶ λόγους ποιησάμενος περὶ ξυμμαχίας πρὸς αὐτούς , ὡς οὐκ ἔπειθεν , ἀλλ’ ἀπεκρίναντο πόλει μὲν ἂν οὐ δέξασθαι , ἀγορὰν δ’ ἔξω παρέξειν , ἀπέπλει ἐς τὸ Ῥήγιον .
After this, Alcibiades sailed across in his own ship to Messana, and made proposals to them for forming an alliance; but when he did not prevail on them, but they answered that they could not receive him within their city, though they would afford him a market outside, he sailed back again to Rhegium.


6.50.2
4370
καὶ εὐθὺς ξυμπληρώσαντες ἑξήκοντα ναῦς ἐκ πασῶν οἱ στρατηγοὶ καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια λαβόντες παρέπλεον ἐς Νάξον , τὴν ἄλλην στρατιὰν ἐν Ῥηγίῳ καταλιπόντες καὶ ἕνα σφῶν αὐτῶν .
Then the generals immediately joined in manning sixty ships out of the whole number, and, taking provisions for them, coasted along to Naxus, leaving the rest of the armament at Rhegium with one of their own body.


6.50.3
4371
Ναξίων δὲ δεξαμένων τῇ πόλει παρέπλεον ἐς Κατάνην .
On the Naxians' receiving them within their city, they coasted on to Catana;


6.50.3
4372
καὶ ὡς αὐτοὺς οἱ Καταναῖοι οὐκ ἐδέχοντο ( ἐνῆσαν γὰρ αὐτόθι ἄνδρες τὰ Συρακοσίων βουλόμενοι ) , ἐκομίσθησαν ἐπὶ τὸν Τηρίαν ποταμόν , καὶ αὐλισάμενοι τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ἐπὶ Συρακούσας ἔπλεον ἐπὶ κέρως ἔχοντες τὰς ἄλλας ναῦς ·
and when the inhabitants refused to admit them, (for there was in that place a party that favoured the cause of the Syracusans,) they proceeded to the river Terias.


6.50.4
4373
δέκα δὲ τῶν νεῶν προύπεμψαν ἐς τὸν μέγαν λιμένα πλεῦσαί τε καὶ κατασκέψασθαι εἴ τι ναυτικόν ἐστι καθειλκυσμένον , καὶ κηρῦξαι ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν προσπλεύσαντας ὅτι Ἀθηναῖοι ἥκουσι Λεοντίνους ἐς τὴν ἑαυτῶν κατοικιοῦντες κατὰ ξυμμαχίαν καὶ ξυγγένειαν ·
Having spent the night there, the next day they sailed in column towards Syracuse, with the rest of the ships; for ten of their squadron they had sent on before, to sail into the great harbour, and observe whether there were any fleet launched;


6.50.4
4374
τοὺς οὖν ὄντας ἐν Συρακούσαις Λεοντίνων ὡς παρὰ φίλους καὶ εὐεργέτας Ἀθηναίους ἀδεῶς ἀπιέναι .
and to proclaim from their ships, " that the Athenians were come to reinstate the Leontines in their own country, on the ground of alliance and kindred; and therefore that such of them as were in Syracuse should withdraw from it, and without any apprehension join the Athenians, as friends and benefactors."


6.50.5
4375
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐκηρύχθη καὶ κατεσκέψαντο τήν τε πόλιν καὶ τοὺς λιμένας καὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν χώραν ἐξ ἧς αὐτοῖς ὁρμωμένοις πολεμητέα ἦν , ἀπέπλευσαν πάλιν ἐς Κατάνην .
So when this proclamation had been made, and they had reconnoitred the city, the harbours, and the features of the country which they would have to make the base of their operations in the war, they sailed back again to Catana.


6.51.1
4376
καὶ ἐκκλησίας γενομένης τὴν μὲν στρατιὰν οὐκ ἐδέχοντο οἱ Καταναῖοι , τοὺς δὲ στρατηγοὺς ἐσελθόντας ἐκέλευον , εἴ τι βούλονται , εἰπεῖν .
An assembly having been held there, the inhabitants did not admit the armament, but told the generals to come in and say what they wished.


6.51.1
4377
καὶ λέγοντος τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου , καὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει πρὸς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τετραμμένων , οἱ στρατιῶται πυλίδα τινὰ ἐνῳκοδομημένην κακῶς ἔλαθον διελόντες , καὶ ἐσελθόντες ἠγόραζον ἐς τὴν πόλιν .
While Alcibiades was speaking, and the attention of those in the city was turned to the assembly, the soldiers, without being observed, broke through a postern which had been ill built up in the wall, and entering the city stationed themselves in the market-place.


6.51.2
4378
τῶν δὲ Καταναίων οἱ μὲν τὰ τῶν Συρακοσίων φρονοῦντες , ὡς εἶδον τὸ στράτευμα ἔνδον , εὐθὺς περιδεεῖς γενόμενοι ὑπεξῆλθον οὐ πολλοί τινες , οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ἐψηφίσαντό τε ξυμμαχίαν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα ἐκέλευον ἐκ Ῥηγίου κομίζειν .
When those of the Catanaeans who favoured the Syracusans saw the army within the walls, being immediately very much alarmed, they secretly went out of the place, as they formed but a small party; while the rest voted for an alliance with the Athenians, and begged them to fetch the rest of their forces from Rhegium.


6.51.3
4379
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο διαπλεύσαντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὸ Ῥήγιον , πάσῃ ἤδη τῇ στρατιᾷ ἄραντες ἐς τὴν Κατάνην , ἐπειδὴ ἀφίκοντο , κατεσκευάζοντο τὸ στρατόπεδον .
After this the Athenians sailed to Rhegium, and having now put out with all their armament for Catana, on their arrival there established themselves in their camp.


6.52.1
4380
ἐσηγγέλλετο δὲ αὐτοῖς ἔκ τε Καμαρίνης ὡς , εἰ ἔλθοιεν , προσχωροῖεν ἄν , καὶ ὅτι Συρακόσιοι πληροῦσι ναυτικόν .
Now tidings were brought to them, both from Camarina, that if they went there, the inhabitants would go over to them, and also that the Syracusans were manning a fleet.


6.52.1
4381
ἁπάσῃ οὖν τῇ στρατιᾷ παρέπλευσαν πρῶτον μὲν ἐπὶ Συρακούσας ·
They coasted along therefore with all their force, in the first instance, to Syracuse;


6.52.1
4382
καὶ ὡς οὐδὲν ηὗρον ναυτικὸν πληρούμενον , παρεκομίζοντο αὖθις ἐπὶ Καμαρίνης , καὶ σχόντες ἐς τὸν αἰγιαλὸν ἐπεκηρυκεύοντο .
and when they found no fleet manning, they again proceeded along the shore towards Camarina; and having brought to at the beach, sent a herald to the people.


6.52.1
4383
οἱ δ’ οὐκ ἐδέχοντο , λέγοντες σφίσι τὰ ὅρκια εἶναι μιᾷ νηὶ καταπλεόντων Ἀθηναίων δέχεσθαι , ἢν μὴ αὐτοὶ πλείους μεταπέμπωσιν .
They, however, did not admit them, saying that their agreement on oath was to receive the Athenians, when they sailed to them with only a single ship, unless they should themselves send for more.


6.52.2
4384
ἄπρακτοι δὲ γενόμενοι ἀπέπλεον ·
Being thus unsuccessful, they sailed back again;


6.52.2
4385
καὶ ἀποβάντες κατά τι τῆς Συρακοσίας καὶ ἁρπαγὴν ποιησάμενοι , καὶ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἱππέων βοηθησάντων καὶ τῶν ψιλῶν τινὰς ἐσκεδασμένους διαφθειράντων , ἀπεκομίσθησαν ἐς Κατάνην .
and after they had landed on a part of the Syracusan territory, and the cavalry from Syracuse had come to the rescue, and killed some stragglers of the light-armed, they went back to Catana.


6.53.1
4386
καὶ καταλαμβάνουσι τὴν Σαλαμινίαν ναῦν ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν ἥκουσαν ἐπί τε Ἀλκιβιάδην ὡς κελεύσοντας ἀποπλεῖν ἐς ἀπολογίαν ὧν ἡ πόλις ἐνεκάλει , καὶ ἐπ’ ἄλλους τινὰς τῶν στρατιωτῶν τῶν μετ’ αὐτοῦ μεμηνυμένων περὶ τῶν μυστηρίων ὡς ἀσεβούντων , τῶν δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν Ἑρμῶν .
There they found the ship Salaminia come from Athens for Alcibiades—to order him to sail back and defend himself against the charges which the state brought against him—and for some others of the soldiers, who with him had been informed against, as being guilty of impiety with regard to the mysteries, and some of them with regard to the Mercuries also.


6.53.2
4387
οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἐπειδὴ ἡ στρατιὰ ἀπέπλευσεν , οὐδὲν ἧσσον ζήτησιν ἐποιοῦντο τῶν περὶ τὰ μυστήρια καὶ τῶν περὶ τοὺς Ἑρμᾶς δρασθέντων , καὶ οὐ δοκιμάζοντες τοὺς μηνυτάς , ἀλλὰ πάντα ὑπόπτως ἀποδεχόμενοι , διὰ πονηρῶν ἀνθρώπων πίστιν πάνυ χρηστοὺς τῶν πολιτῶν ξυλλαμβάνοντες κατέδουν , χρησιμώτερον ἡγούμενοι εἶναι βασανίσαι τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ εὑρεῖν ἢ διὰ μηνυτοῦ πονηρίαν τινὰ καὶ χρηστὸν δοκοῦντα εἶναι αἰτιαθέντα ἀνέλεγκτον διαφυγεῖν .
For the Athenians, after the armament had sailed away, made no less investigation into what had been done in the case of the mysteries and in that of the Mercuries; and as they did not test the character of the informers, but in their suspicious mood admitted all who came forward, on the credit of unprincipled men they arrested and threw into prison very excellent citizens; thinking it more expedient to sift the matter and find it out, than that, in consequence of the bad principle of an informer, an accused person, even though he had a good character, should be unquestioned, and escape.


6.53.3
4388
ἐπιστάμενος γὰρ ὁ δῆμος ἀκοῇ τὴν Πεισιστράτου καὶ τῶν παίδων τυραννίδα χαλεπὴν τελευτῶσαν γενομένην καὶ προσέτι οὐδ’ ὑφ’ ἑαυτῶν καὶ Ἁρμοδίου καταλυθεῖσαν , ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων , ἐφοβεῖτο αἰεὶ καὶ πάντα ὑπόπτως ἐλάμβανεν .
For the commons, knowing by report that the tyranny of Pisistratus and his sons had proved galling at last, and, moreover, that it had not even been put down by themselves and Harmodius, but by the Lacedaemonians, were always afraid, and took every thing suspiciously.


6.54.1
4389
τὸ γὰρ Ἀριστογείτονος καὶ Ἁρμοδίου τόλμημα δι’ ἐρωτικὴν ξυντυχίαν ἐπεχειρήθη , ἣν ἐγὼ ἐπὶ πλέον διηγησάμενος ἀποφανῶ οὔτε τοὺς ἄλλους οὔτε αὐτοὺς Ἀθηναίους περὶ τῶν σφετέρων τυράννων οὐδὲ περὶ τοῦ γενομένου ἀκριβὲς οὐδὲν λέγοντας .
[For the daring deed of Aristogiton and Harmodius was undertaken in consequence of a love-adventure; by relating which, at some length, I shall show that neither other people, nor the Athenians themselves, give any accurate account of their own tyrants, or of what has happened amongst them.


6.54.2
4390
Πεισιστράτου γὰρ γηραιοῦ τελευτήσαντος ἐν τῇ τυραννίδι οὐχ Ἵππαρχος , ὥσπερ οἱ πολλοὶ οἴονται , ἀλλ’ Ἱππίας πρεσβύτατος ὢν ἔσχε τὴν ἀρχήν .
For when Pisistratus had died at an advanced age in possession of the tyranny, it was not Hipparchus, as the generality suppose, but Hippias, that was eldest of his sons, and obtained the government.


6.54.2
4391
γενομένου δὲ Ἁρμοδίου ὥρᾳ ἡλικίας λαμπροῦ Ἀριστογείτων ἀνὴρ τῶν ἀστῶν , μέσος πολίτης , ἐραστὴς ὢν εἶχεν αὐτόν .
Now Harmodius being in the flower of youth and beauty, Aristogiton, a citizen of middle rank in the city, was enamoured of him, and enjoyed his favour.


6.54.3
4392
πειραθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἁρμόδιος ὑπὸ Ἱππάρχου τοῦ Πεισιστράτου καὶ οὐ πεισθεὶς καταγορεύει τῷ Ἀριστογείτονι .
Harmodius, then, being solicited by Hipparchus, son of Pisistratus, and not prevailed upon, denounced him to Aristogiton.


6.54.3
4393
ὁ δὲ ἐρωτικῶς περιαλγήσας καὶ φοβηθεὶς τὴν Ἱππάρχου δύναμιν μὴ βίᾳ προσαγάγηται αὐτόν , ἐπιβουλεύει εὐθὺς ὡς ἀπὸ τῆς ὑπαρχούσης ἀξιώσεως κατάλυσιν τῇ τυραννίδι .
He, lover-like, being exceedingly indignant, and fearing the power of Hipparchus, lest he should take him by force, immediately formed a design, (such as he could in the position he held,) for putting down the tyranny.


6.54.4
4394
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ὁ Ἵππαρχος ὡς αὖθις πειράσας οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἔπειθε τὸν Ἁρμόδιον , βίαιον μὲν οὐδὲν ἐβούλετο δρᾶν , ἐν τρόπῳ δέ τινι ἀφανεῖ ὡς οὐ διὰ τοῦτο δὴ παρεσκευάζετο προπηλακιῶν αὐτόν .
In the mean time Hipparchus, having again solicited Harmodius with no better success, would not indeed offer any violence to him, but prepared to insult him in some secret way or other, as though it were not on that account.


6.54.5
4395
οὐδὲ γὰρ τὴν ἄλλην ἀρχὴν ἐπαχθὴς ἦν ἐς τοὺς πολλούς , ἀλλ’ ἀνεπιφθόνως κατεστήσατο ·
For neither in his general government was he severe towards the mass of the people, but conducted it without exciting any odium;


6.54.5
4396
καὶ ἐπετήδευσαν ἐπὶ πλεῖστον δὴ τύραννοι οὗτοι ἀρετὴν καὶ ξύνεσιν , καὶ Ἀθηναίους εἰκοστὴν μόνον πρασσόμενοι τῶν γιγνομένων τήν τε πόλιν αὐτῶν καλῶς διεκόσμησαν καὶ τοὺς πολέμους διέφερον καὶ ἐς τὰ ἱερὰ ἔθυον .
and, for tyrants, these men in the greatest degree studied virtue and intelligence; and though they exacted from the Athenians only a twentieth of their income, they adorned their city in a beautiful manner, and carried on their wars, and provided sacrifices for the temples.


6.54.6
4397
τὰ δὲ ἄλλα αὐτὴ ἡ πόλις τοῖς πρὶν κειμένοις νόμοις ἐχρῆτο , πλὴν καθ’ ὅσον αἰεί τινα ἐπεμέλοντο σφῶν αὐτῶν ἐν ταῖς ἀρχαῖς εἶναι .
The state enjoyed, too, the laws which had been previously enacted, in all other respects, except that they always took care that one of their own family should hold the offices.


6.54.6
4398
καὶ ἄλλοι τε αὐτῶν ἦρξαν τὴν ἐνιαύσιον Ἀθηναίοις ἀρχὴν καὶ Πεισίστρατος ὁ Ἱππίου τοῦ τυραννεύσαντος υἱός , τοῦ πάππου ἔχων τ- ὄνομα , ὃς τῶν δώδεκα θεῶν βωμὸν τὸν ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ἄρχων ἀνέθηκε καὶ τὸν τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος ἐν Πυθίου .
Amongst others of them who held the yearly archonship at Athens was Pisistratus, son of the Hippias who had been tyrant, who bore his grandfather's name, and dedicated, while archon, the altar to the twelve gods in the market-place, and that of Apollo in the Pythian precinct.


6.54.7
4399
καὶ τῷ μὲν ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ προσοικοδομήσας ὕστερον ὁ δῆμος Ἀθηναίων μεῖζον μῆκος τοῦ βωμοῦ ἠφάνισε τ- ἐπίγραμμα ·
The Athenian people having afterwards made an addition to the length of that in the market-place, obliterated the inscription on the altar;


6.54.7
4400
τοῦ δ’ ἐν Πυθίου ἔτι καὶ νῦν δῆλόν ἐστιν ἀμυδροῖς γράμμασι λέγον τάδε ·
but that in the Pythian precinct is even still visible, though in faded letters, to this purport:


6.54.7
4401
μνῆμα τόδ’ ἧς ἀρχῆς Πεισίστρατος Ἱππίου υἱός θῆκεν Ἀπόλλωνος Πυθίου ἐν τεμένει .
"Pisistratus, the son of Hippias, here,In Pythian precinct, marked his archon year."


6.55.1
4402
ὅτι δὲ πρεσβύτατος ὢν Ἱππίας ἦρξεν , εἰδὼς μὲν καὶ ἀκοῇ ἀκριβέστερον ἄλλων ἰσχυρίζομαι , γνοίη δ’ ἄν τις καὶ αὐτῷ τούτῳ ·
Now that Hippias, as being the eldest son, succeeded to the government, I both positively assert, because I know it by report more accurately than others, and one may also learn it from this very fact.


6.55.1
4403
παῖδες γὰρ αὐτῷ μόνῳ φαίνονται τῶν γνησίων ἀδελφῶν γενόμενοι , ὡς ὅ τε βωμὸς σημαίνει καὶ ἡ στήλη περὶ τῆς τῶν τυράννων ἀδικίας ἡ ἐν τῇ Ἀθηναίων ἀκροπόλει σταθεῖσα , ἐν ᾗ Θεσσαλοῦ μὲν οὐδ’ Ἱππάρχου οὐδεὶς παῖς γέγραπται , Ἱππίου δὲ πέντε , οἳ αὐτῷ ἐκ Μυρρίνης τῆς Καλλίου τοῦ Ὑπεροχίδου θυγατρὸς ἐγένοντο ·
He alone of the legitimate brothers appears to have had children; as both the altar shows, and the pillar commemorating the wrong committed by the tyrants, placed in the Athenian citadel, on which is inscribed the name of no child of Thlessalus, or of Hipparchus, but five of Hippias, who were born to him of Myrrhine, daughter of Callias, son of Hyperechides.


6.55.1
4404
εἰκὸς γὰρ ἦν τὸν πρεσβύτατον πρῶτον γῆμαι .
For it was natural that the eldest should have married first.


6.55.2
4405
καὶ ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ στήλῃ πρῶτος γέγραπται μετὰ τὸν πατέρα , οὐδὲ τοῦτο ἀπεοικότως διὰ τὸ πρεσβεύειν τε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ τυραννεῦσαι .
and that, too, not unnaturally, as he was the eldest next to him, and enjoyed the tyranny.


6.55.3
4406
οὐ μὴν οὐδ’ ἂν κατασχεῖν μοι δοκεῖ ποτὲ Ἱππίας τὸ παραχρῆμα ῥᾳδίως τὴν τυραννίδα , εἰ Ἵππαρχος μὲν ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ ὢν ἀπέθανεν , αὐτὸς δὲ αὐθημερὸν καθίστατο ·
Nor, again, do I think that Hippias would ever have obtained the tyranny with such ease at the moment, if Hipparchus had been in power when he was killed, and Hippias had had to establish himself in it on the same day.


6.55.3
4407
ἀλλὰ καὶ διὰ τὸ πρότερον ξύνηθες τοῖς μὲν πολίταις φοβερόν , ἐς δὲ τοὺς ἐπικούρους ἀκριβές , πολλῷ τῷ περιόντι τοῦ ἀσφαλοῦς κατεκράτησε , καὶ οὐχ ὡς ἀδελφὸς νεώτερος ὢν ἠπόρησεν , ἐν ᾧ οὐ πρότερον ξυνεχῶς ὡμιλήκει τῇ ἀρχῇ .
But owing to his former habit, both of striking fear into the citizens, and of paying strict attention to his mercenaries, he retained his sway with superabundant security; and was at no loss, as though he had been a younger brother, and so had not previously been familiar with the constant exercise of power.


6.55.4
4408
Ἱππάρχῳ δὲ ξυνέβη τοῦ πάθους τῇ δυστυχίᾳ ὀνομασθέντα καὶ τὴν δόξαν τῆς τυραννίδος ἐς τὰ ἔπειτα προσλαβεῖν .
But it was the lot of Hipparchus, because he was rendered famous by the sad fate which befell him, to receive also in succeeding ages the repute of having enjoyed the tyranny.


6.56.1
4409
τὸν δ’ οὖν Ἁρμόδιον ἀπαρνηθέντα τὴν πείρασιν , ὥσπερ διενοεῖτο , προυπηλάκισεν ·
So then, when Harmodius had resisted his solicitation, he insulted him, as he intended.


6.56.1
4410
ἀδελφὴν γὰρ αὐτοῦ κόρην ἐπαγγείλαντες ἥκειν κανοῦν οἴσουσαν ἐν πομπῇ τινί , ἀπήλασαν λέγοντες οὐδὲ ἐπαγγεῖλαι τὴν ἀρχὴν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀξίαν εἶναι .
For after summoning a sister of his, a young girl, to come and bear a basket in a certain procession, they rejected her when she came, saying that they had not summoned her at all, as she was not worthy of the honour.


6.56.2
4411
χαλεπῶς δὲ ἐνεγκόντος τοῦ Ἁρμοδίου πολλῷ δὴ μᾶλλον δι’ ἐκεῖνον καὶ ὁ Ἀριστογείτων παρωξύνετο .
Harmodius being very indignant at this, Aristogiton also was, for his sake, much more exasperated than ever.


6.56.2
4412
καὶ αὐτοῖς τὰ μὲν ἄλλα πρὸς τοὺς ξυνεπιθησομένους τῷ ἔργῳ ἐπέπρακτο , περιέμενον δὲ Παναθήναια τὰ μεγάλα , ἐν ᾗ μόνον ἡμέρᾳ οὐχ ὕποπτον ἐγίγνετο ἐν ὅπλοις τῶν πολιτῶν τοὺς τὴν πομπὴν πέμψοντας ἁθρόους γενέσθαι ·
And now all their other arrangements had been made with those who were to join them in taking the business in hand; but they were waiting for the great Panathenaic festival, on which day alone it was not considered a suspicious circumstance that those of the citizens who had conducted the procession should meet together in arms;


6.56.2
4413
καὶ ἔδει ἄρξαι μὲν αὐτούς , ξυνεπαμύνειν δὲ εὐθὺς τὰ πρὸς τοὺς δορυφόρους ἐκείνους .
and they were themselves to begin, but the rest immediately to join in aiding them against the body-guards.


6.56.3
4414
ἦσαν δὲ οὐ πολλοὶ οἱ ξυνομωμοκότες ἀσφαλείας ἕνεκα ·
The conspirators were not numerous, for security's sake;


6.56.3
4415
ἤλπιζον γὰρ καὶ τοὺς μὴ προειδότας , εἰ καὶ ὁποσοιοῦν τολμήσειαν , ἐκ τοῦ παραχρῆμα ἔχοντάς γε ὅπλα ἐθελήσειν σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ξυνελευθεροῦν .
for they hoped that if any number whatever dared to make the attempt, even those who were not before privy to it would be willing at the moment, inasmuch as they had arms in their hands, to join in effecting their own freedom.


6.57.1
4416
καὶ ὡς ἐπῆλθεν ἡ ἑορτή , Ἱππίας μὲν ἔξω ἐν τῷ Κεραμεικῷ καλουμένῳ μετὰ τῶν δορυφόρων διεκόσμει ὡς ἕκαστα ἐχρῆν τῆς πομπῆς προϊέναι , ὁ δὲ Ἁρμόδιος καὶ ὁ Ἀριστογείτων ἔχοντες ἤδη τὰ ἐγχειρίδια ἐς τὸ ἔργον προῇσαν .
When therefore the festival arrived, Hippias, with his body-guard, was arranging outside of the walls, in what is called the Ceramicus, how the several parts of the procession were to proceed.


6.57.2
4417
καὶ ὡς εἶδόν τινα τῶν ξυνωμοτῶν σφίσι διαλεγόμενον οἰκείως τῷ Ἱππίᾳ ( ἦν δὲ πᾶσιν εὐπρόσοδος ὁ Ἱππίας ) , ἔδεισαν καὶ ἐνόμισαν μεμηνῦσθαί τε καὶ ὅσον οὐκ ἤδη ξυλληφθήσεσθαι .
And when they saw one of their accomplices in familiar conversation with Hippias, (for he was easy of access to all,) they were alarmed, and thought that some information had been laid against them, and that they would be almost immediately arrested. They wished therefore to avenge themselves beforehand, if possible, on the man who had aggrieved them, and for whose punishment they were exposing themselves to all that danger;


6.57.3
4418
τὸν λυπήσαντα οὖν σφᾶς καὶ δι’ ὅνπερ πάντα ἐκινδύνευον ἐβούλοντο πρότερον , εἰ δύναιντο , προτιμωρήσασθαι , καὶ ὥσπερ εἶχον ὥρμησαν ἔσω τῶν πυλῶν , καὶ περιέτυχον τῷ Ἱππάρχῳ παρὰ τὸ Λεωκόρειον καλούμενον , καὶ εὐθὺς ἀπερισκέπτως προσπεσόντες καὶ ὡς ἂν μάλιστα δι’ ὀργῆς ὁ μὲν ἐρωτικῆς , ὁ δὲ ὑβρισμένος , ἔτυπτον καὶ ἀποκτείνουσιν αὐτόν .
and so they rushed straightway within the gates, and meeting with Hipparchus by the Leocorium, at once fell on him in a reckless manner, under the influence of the most vehement passion, inspired by love in the one case, and by insult in the other, and smote him, and slew him.


6.57.4
4419
καὶ ὁ μὲν τοὺς δορυφόρους τὸ αὐτίκα διαφεύγει ὁ Ἀριστογείτων , ξυνδραμόντος τοῦ ὄχλου , καὶ ὕστερον ληφθεὶς οὐ ῥᾳδίως διετέθη ·
Now one of them, namely, Aristogiton, escaped from the guards at the moment, through the crowd running up;


6.57.4
4420
Ἁρμόδιος δὲ αὐτοῦ παραχρῆμα ἀπόλλυται .
but was seized afterwards, and disposed of in no gentle manner. Harmodius was immediately slain on the spot.


6.58.1
4421
ἀγγελθέντος δὲ Ἱππίᾳ ἐς τὸν Κεραμεικόν , οὐκ ἐπὶ τὸ γενόμενον , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τοὺς πομπέας τοὺς ὁπλίτας , πρότερον ἢ αἰσθέσθαι αὐτοὺς ἄπωθεν ὄντας , εὐθὺς ἐχώρησε , καὶ ἀδήλως τῇ ὄψει πλασάμενος πρὸς τὴν ξυμφορὰν ἐκέλευσεν αὐτούς , δείξας τι χωρίον , ἀπελθεῖν ἐς αὐτὸ ἄνευ τῶν ὅπλων .
When the news were brought to Hippias in the Ceramicus, he proceeded immediately, not to the scene of action, but to the armed men in the procession, before they were aware of the matter, in consequence of their being at some distance from the spot; and with his countenance feigned to suit the occasion, so as not to betray his feelings, he pointed out a certain spot, and desired them to retire into it without their arms.


6.58.2
4422
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀνεχώρησαν οἰόμενοί τι ἐρεῖν αὐτόν , ὁ δὲ τοῖς ἐπικούροις φράσας τὰ ὅπλα ὑπολαβεῖν ἐξελέγετο εὐθὺς οὓς ἐπῃτιᾶτο καὶ εἴ τις ηὑρέθη ἐγχειρίδιον ἔχων ·
Accordingly they withdrew, supposing that he would deliver an address to them;


6.58.2
4423
μετὰ γὰρ ἀσπίδος καὶ δόρατος εἰώθεσαν τὰς πομπὰς ποιεῖν .
while he, after commanding his guards to remove the arms, immediately picked out such men as he was disposed to think guilty, and whoever was found with a dagger; for it was only with shield and spear that they were accustomed to make their processions.


6.59.1
4424
τοιούτῳ μὲν τρόπῳ δι’ ἐρωτικὴν λύπην ἥ τε ἀρχὴ τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς καὶ ἡ ἀλόγιστος τόλμα ἐκ τοῦ παραχρῆμα περιδεοῦς Ἁρμοδίῳ καὶ Ἀριστογείτονι ἐγένετο .
In this manner both the original conspiracy was entered into by Harmodius and Aristogiton for a love offence, and their rash venture attempted through their alarm at the moment.


6.59.2
4425
τοῖς δ’ Ἀθηναίοις χαλεπωτέρα μετὰ τοῦτο ἡ τυραννὶς κατέστη , καὶ ὁ Ἱππίας διὰ φόβου ἤδη μᾶλλον ὢν τῶν τε πολιτῶν πολλοὺς ἔκτεινε καὶ πρὸς τὰ ἔξω ἅμα διεσκοπεῖτο , εἴ ποθεν ἀσφάλειάν τινα ὁρῴη μεταβολῆς γενομένης ὑπάρχουσάν οἱ .
After this, the tyranny was more severe on the Athenians than before; and Hippias, being now in greater apprehension, both put to death many of the citizens, and kept his eye also on foreign states, in whatever quarter he had a prospect of a safe retreat being secured for him, in case of any revolution.


6.59.3
4426
Ἱππόκλου γοῦν τοῦ Λαμψακηνοῦ τυράννου Αἰαντίδῃ τῷ παιδὶ θυγατέρα ἑαυτοῦ μετὰ ταῦτα Ἀρχεδίκην Ἀθηναῖος ὢν Λαμψακηνῷ ἔδωκεν , αἰσθανόμενος αὐτοὺς μέγα παρὰ βασιλεῖ Δαρείῳ δύνασθαι .
At any rate, he married his daughter Archedice to Aeantides, son of the tyrant of Lampsacus— Athenian as he was, to a Lampsacene—because he saw that they had great influence with king Darius.


6.59.3
4427
καὶ αὐτῆς σῆμα ἐν Λαμψάκῳ ἐστὶν ἐπίγραμμα ἔχον τόδε ·
There is a monument to her at Lampsacus, with this inscription:


6.59.3
4428
ἀνδρὸς ἀριστεύσαντος ἐν Ἑλλάδι τῶν ἐφ’ ἑαυτοῦ Ἱππίου Ἀρχεδίκην ἥδε κέκευθε κόνις , ἣ πατρός τε καὶ ἀνδρὸς ἀδελφῶν τ’ οὖσα τυράννων παίδων τ’ οὐκ ἤρθη νοῦν ἐς ἀτασθαλίην .
"Beneath this dust Archedice finds peace,Whose sire was Hippias, peerless once in Greece.She, though of tyrants daughter, sister, bride,And mother, ne'er was lifted up with pride."


6.59.4
4429
τυραννεύσας δὲ ἔτη τρία Ἱππίας ἔτι Ἀθηναίων καὶ παυθεὶς ἐν τῷ τετάρτῳ ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Ἀλκμεωνιδῶν τῶν φευγόντων , ἐχώρει ὑπόσπονδος ἔς τε Σίγειον καὶ παρ’ Αἰαντίδην ἐς Λάμψακον , ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ὡς βασιλέα Δαρεῖον , ὅθεν καὶ ὁρμώμενος ἐς Μαραθῶνα ὕστερον ἔτει εἰκοστῷ ἤδη γέρων ὢν μετὰ Μήδων ἐστράτευσεν .
With regard to Hippias, having retained the tyranny at Athens three years longer, and being deposed in the fourth year by the Lacedaemonians and the banished Alcmaeonidae he went, under treaty, to Sigeum, then to Aeantides at Lampsacus, and thence to the court of king Darius; from which also he set out twenty years after, when now an old man, and accompanied the Median forces to Marathon.


6.60.1
4430
ὧν ἐνθυμούμενος ὁ δῆμος ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καὶ μιμνῃσκόμενος ὅσα ἀκοῇ περὶ αὐτῶν ἠπίστατο , χαλεπὸς ἦν τότε καὶ ὑπόπτης ἐς τοὺς περὶ τῶν μυστικῶν τὴν αἰτίαν λαβόντας , καὶ πάντα αὐτοῖς ἐδόκει ἐπὶ ξυνωμοσίᾳ ὀλιγαρχικῇ καὶ τυραννικῇ πεπρᾶχθαι .
Reflecting, then, on these things, and recalling to mind all that they knew by report concerning them, the Athenian people was wrathful at that time, and suspicious of those who had incurred accusation on the subject of the mysteries, and thought that every thing had been done on the strength of a conspiracy for establishing an oligarchy, or a tyranny.


6.60.2
4431
καὶ ὡς αὐτῶν διὰ τὸ τοιοῦτον ὀργιζομένων πολλοί τε καὶ ἀξιόλογοι ἄνθρωποι ἤδη ἐν τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ ἦσαν καὶ οὐκ ἐν παύλῃ ἐφαίνετο , ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡμέραν ἐπεδίδοσαν μᾶλλον ἐς τὸ ἀγριώτερόν τε καὶ πλείους ἔτι ξυλλαμβάνειν , ἐνταῦθα ἀναπείθεται εἷς τῶν δεδεμένων , ὅσπερ ἐδόκει αἰτιώτατος εἶναι , ὑπὸ τῶν ξυνδεσμωτῶν τινὸς εἴτε ἄρα καὶ τὰ ὄντα μηνῦσαι εἴτε καὶ οὔ ·
So when, in consequence of their anger on this account, many persons of consideration were already in prison, and the matter appeared not to be stopping, but they were daily proceeding to greater severity and to more numerous arrests;


6.60.2
4432
ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα γὰρ εἰκάζεται , τὸ δὲ σαφὲς οὐδεὶς οὔτε τότε οὔτε ὕστερον ἔχει εἰπεῖν περὶ τῶν δρασάντων τὸ ἔργον .
under these circumstances one of the men in confinement, who was thought to be the most guilty of them, was persuaded by one of his fellow prisoners to give information, whether true or not; for suppositions are entertained both ways, and the certain fact respecting those who had done the deed no one was either able to state then, or has since been able.


6.60.3
4433
λέγων δὲ ἔπεισεν αὐτὸν ὡς χρή , εἰ μὴ καὶ δέδρακεν , αὑτόν τε ἄδειαν ποιησάμενον σῶσαι καὶ τὴν πόλιν τῆς παρούσης ὑποψίας παῦσαι ·
By his arguments then he persuaded him, that he ought, even if he had not done the deed, both to save himself by gaining a promise of impunity, and to stop his country from its present suspiciousness:


6.60.3
4434
βεβαιοτέραν γὰρ αὐτῷ σωτηρίαν εἶναι ὁμολογήσαντι μετ’ ἀδείας ἢ ἀρνηθέντι διὰ δίκης ἐλθεῖν .
for that his preservation was more sure, if he confessed with a promise of impunity, than if he denied it, and were brought to trial.


6.60.4
4435
καὶ ὁ μὲν αὐτός τε καθ’ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ κατ’ ἄλλων μηνύει τὸ τῶν Ἑρμῶν ·
Accordingly he informed both against himself and some others, respecting the Mercuries;


6.60.4
4436
ὁ δὲ δῆμος ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἄσμενος λαβών , ὡς ᾤετο , τὸ σαφὲς καὶ δεινὸν ποιούμενοι πρότερον εἰ τοὺς ἐπιβουλεύοντας σφῶν τῷ πλήθει μὴ εἴσονται , τὸν μὲν μηνυτὴν εὐθὺς καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους μετ’ αὐτοῦ ὅσων μὴ κατηγορήκει ἔλυσαν , τοὺς δὲ καταιτιαθέντας κρίσεις ποιήσαντες τοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτειναν , ὅσοι ξυνελήφθησαν , τῶν δὲ διαφυγόντων θάνατον καταγνόντες ἐπανεῖπον ἀργύριον τῷ ἀποκτείναντι .
and the Athenian people having gladly ascertained, as they supposed, the truth of the matter, and having been before indignant at the thought of not discovering those who had plotted against their commons, immediately set at liberty the informer and his companions, such as he had not accused; while with regard to those who were charged with the crime, having brought them to trial, they executed all of them who were seized, and having passed sentence upon those who had fled, proclaimed a reward in money for any one who slew them.


6.60.5
4437
κ- ἐν τούτῳ οἱ μὲν παθόντες ἄδηλον ἦν εἰ ἀδίκως ἐτετιμώρηντο , ἡ μέντοι ἄλλη πόλις ἐν τῷ παρόντι περιφανῶς ὠφέλητο .
By this course, though it was doubtful whether those who suffer: had been punished unjustly or not, yet the rest of the community were manifestly benefited.


6.61.1
4438
περὶ δὲ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἐναγόντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν , οἵπερ καὶ πρὶν ἐκπλεῖν αὐτὸν ἐπέθεντο , χαλεπῶς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐλάμβανον ·
With regard to Alcibiades, the Athenians took a severe view of the case, being instigated by his enemies, the same men as had also attacked him before his going on the expedition.


6.61.1
4439
καὶ ἐπειδὴ τὸ τῶν Ἑρμῶν ᾤοντο σαφὲς ἔχειν , πολὺ δὴ μᾶλλον καὶ τὰ μυστικά , ὧν ἐπαίτιος ἦν , μετὰ τοῦ αὐτοῦ λόγου καὶ τῆς ξυνωμοσίας ἐπὶ τῷ δήμῳ ἀπ’ ἐκείνου ἐδόκει πραχθῆναι .
And when they fancied they were in possession of the truth respecting the Mercuries, they thought much more than ever that the affair of the mysteries also, in which he was implicated, had been done by him with the same design, and in connexion with the plot against the democracy.


6.61.2
4440
καὶ γάρ τις καὶ στρατιὰ Λακεδαιμονίων οὐ πολλὴ ἔτυχε κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ἐν ᾧ περὶ ταῦτα ἐθορυβοῦντο μέχρι Ἰσθμοῦ παρελθοῦσα , πρὸς Βοιωτούς τι πράσσοντες .
For a small force of Lacedaemonians happened too, just at the time when they were in commotion on these subjects, to have advanced as far as the Isthmus, in pursuance of some scheme with the Boeotians.


6.61.2
4441
ἐδόκει οὖν ἐκείνου πράξαντος καὶ οὐ Βοιωτῶν ἕνεκα ἀπὸ ξυνθήματος ἥκειν , καὶ εἰ μὴ ἔφθασαν δὴ αὐτοὶ κατὰ τὸ μήνυμα ξυλλαβόντες τοὺς ἄνδρας , προδοθῆναι ἂν ἡ πόλις .
They thought therefore that it had come by agreement, through his agency, and not on account of the Boeotians; and that if they had not, in consequence of the information they had received, been beforehand in the arrest of the party, the city would have been betrayed to them.


6.61.2
4442
καί τινα μίαν νύκτα καὶ κατέδαρθον ἐν Θησείῳ τῷ ἐν πόλει ἐν ὅπλοις .
And one night they even slept in arms in the temple of Theseus in the city.


6.61.3
4443
οἵ τε ξένοι τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου οἱ ἐν Ἄργει κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον ὑπωπτεύθησαν τῷ δήμῳ ἐπιτίθεσθαι , καὶ τοὺς ὁμήρους τῶν Ἀργείων τοὺς ἐν ταῖς νήσοις κειμένους οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τότε παρέδοσαν τῷ Ἀργείων δήμῳ διὰ ταῦτα διαχρήσασθαι .
One night indeed they even slept in arms in the temple of Theseus within the walls. The friends, too, of Alcibiades at Argos were at the same time suspected of a design to attack the popular government; and those persons of the Argives who had been deposited in the islands the Athenians on that occasion gave up to the Argive commons to put to death on that account.


6.61.4
4444
πανταχόθεν τε περιειστήκει ὑποψία ἐς τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην .
Thus on all sides there arose suspicion against Alcibiades;


6.61.4
4445
ὥστε βουλόμενοι αὐτὸν ἐς κρίσιν ἀγαγόντες ἀποκτεῖναι , πέμπουσιν οὕτω τὴν Σαλαμινίαν ναῦν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν ἐπί τε ἐκεῖνον καὶ ὧν πέρι ἄλλων ἐμεμήνυτο .
and consequently wishing to bring him to trial, and put him to death, in this way they sent the ship Salaminia to Sicily, both for him and for the rest who had been informed against.


6.61.5
4446
εἴρητο δὲ προειπεῖν αὐτῷ ἀπολογησομένῳ ἀκολουθεῖν , ξυλλαμβάνειν δὲ μή , θεραπεύοντες τό τε πρὸς τοὺς ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ στρατιώτας τε σφετέρους καὶ πολεμίους μὴ θορυβεῖν καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα τοὺς Μαντινέας καὶ Ἀργείους βουλόμενοι παραμεῖναι , δι’ ἐκείνου νομίζοντες πεισθῆναι σφίσι ξυστρατεύειν .
Their orders were, to charge him to accompany the vessel home to plead his defence, but not to arrest him; for they were at the same time careful to avoid raising a commotion amongst both their own soldiers in Sicily and their enemies, and especially wished the Mantineans and Argives to remain there, whom they considered to have been prevailed on by Alcibiades to join them in the expedition.


6.61.6
4447
καὶ ὁ μὲν ἔχων τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ναῦν καὶ οἱ ξυνδιαβεβλημένοι ἀπέπλεον μετὰ τῆς Σαλαμινίας ἐκ τῆς Σικελίας ὡς ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ·
He then, with his own ship and those who had been accused with him, sailed away in the company of the Salaminia from Sicily, as though to return to Athens.


6.61.6
4448
καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐγένοντο ἐν Θουρίοις , οὐκέτι ξυνείποντο , ἀλλ’ ἀπελθόντες ἀπὸ τῆς νεὼς οὐ φανεροὶ ἦσαν , δείσαντες τὸ ἐπὶ διαβολῇ ἐς δίκην καταπλεῦσαι .
But when they had reached Thurii, they followed it no further, but left the vessel and concealed themselves, being afraid of going home to trial with such a prejudice existing against them.


6.61.7
4449
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Σαλαμινίας τέως μὲν ἐζήτουν τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην καὶ τοὺς μετ’ αὐτοῦ ·
The crew of the Salaminia for some time made search for Alcibiades and his companions,


6.61.7
4450
ὡς δ’ οὐδαμοῦ φανεροὶ ἦσαν , ᾤχοντο ἀποπλέοντες .
but when they were nowhere to be found, they departed on their voyage back.


6.61.7
4451
ὁ δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδης ἤδη φυγὰς ὢν οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ἐπὶ πλοίου ἐπεραιώθη ἐς Πελοπόννησον ἐκ τῆς Θουρίας ·
Alcibiades therefore, being now an outlaw, crossed not long after on board a boat from Thurii to the Peloponnese:


6.61.7
4452
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐρήμῃ δίκῃ θάνατον κατέγνωσαν αὐτοῦ τε καὶ τῶν μετ’ ἐκείνου .
and the Athenians, when they were not forthcoming, passed sentence of death upon him and those with him.


6.62.1
4453
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοὶ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ , δύο μέρη ποιήσαντες τοῦ στρατεύματος καὶ λαχὼν ἑκάτερος , ἔπλεον ξύμπαντι ἐπὶ Σελινοῦντος καὶ Ἐγέστης ,βουλόμενοι μὲν εἰδέναι τὰ χρήματα εἰ δώσουσιν οἱ Ἐγεσταῖοι , κατασκέψασθαι δὲ καὶ τῶν Σελινουντίων τὰ πράγματα καὶ τὰ διάφορα μαθεῖν τὰ πρὸς Ἐγεσταίους .
After these things, the remaining generals of the Athenians in Sicily, having made two divisions of the army, and each taken by lot one of them, sailed with the whole force for Selinus and Segesta; wishing to know whether the Segestans would give the promised money, and at the same time to inspect the condition of the Selinuntines, and to learn the state of their differences with the Segestans.


6.62.2
4454
παραπλέοντες δ’ ἐν ἀριστερᾷ τὴν Σικελίαν , τὸ μέρος τὸ πρὸς τὸν Τυρσηνικὸν κόλπον , ἔσχον ἐς Ἱμέραν , ἥπερ μόνη ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει τῆς Σικελίας Ἑλλὰς πόλις ἐστίν ·
And so coasting along Sicily, with the shore on their left hand, on the side towards the Tyrrhene gulf, they landed at Himera, which is the only Grecian city in that part of the island.


6.62.2
4455
καὶ ὡς οὐκ ἐδέχοντο αὐτούς , παρεκομίζοντο .
When they would not receive them, they proceeded on their voyage;


6.62.3
4456
καὶ ἐν τῷ παράπλῳ αἱροῦσιν Ὕκκαρα , πόλισμα Σικανικὸν μέν , Ἐγεσταίοις δὲ πολέμιον ·
and as they coasted along, took Hyccara, which, though a Sicanian town, was engaged in war with the Segestans, and was a petty sea-port.


6.62.3
4457
ἦν δὲ παραθαλασσίδιον .
Having taken the inhabitants of the town for slaves, they gave it up to the Segestans, (for some of their cavalry had joined them,)


6.62.3
4458
καὶ ἀνδραποδίσαντες τὴν πόλιν παρέδοσαν Ἐγεσταίοις ( παρεγένοντο γὰρ αὐτῶν ἱππῆς ) , αὐτοὶ δὲ πάλιν τῷ μὲν πεζῷ ἐχώρουν διὰ τῶν Σικελῶν ἕως ἀφίκοντο ἐς Κατάνην , αἱ δὲ νῆες περιέπλευσαν τὰ ἀνδράποδα ἄγουσαι .
and they themselves returned by land through the country of the Sicels, till they came to Catana; while their ships sailed along the coast with the prisoners on board.


6.62.4
4459
Νικίας δὲ εὐθὺς ἐξ Ὑκκάρων ἐπὶ Ἐγέστης παραπλεύσας , καὶ τ- ἄλλα χρηματίσας καὶ λαβὼν τάλαντα τριάκοντα παρῆν ἐς τὸ στράτευμα ·
Nicias, however, coasted along straightway from Hyccara to Segesta;


6.62.4
4460
καὶ τ- ἀνδράποδα ἀπέδοσαν , καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐξ αὐτῶν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα .
and after transacting his other business, and receiving thirty talents, rejoined the forces. They then sold their slaves, from which were realized a hundred and twenty talents;


6.62.5
4461
καὶ ἐς τοὺς τῶν Σικελῶν ξυμμάχους περιέπλευσαν , στρατιὰν κελεύοντες πέμπειν ·
and sailed round to the allies of the Sicels, giving orders to send them troops.


6.62.5
4462
τῇ τε ἡμισείᾳ τῆς ἑαυτῶν ἦλθον ἐπὶ Ὕβλαν τὴν Γελεᾶτιν πολεμίαν οὖσαν , καὶ οὐχ εἷλον .
With half of their own force, too, they went against Hybla, in the territory of Gela, which was hostile to them; but did not take it.


6.62.5
4463
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
And thus the summer ended.


6.63.1
4464
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος εὐθὺς τὴν ἔφοδον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ Συρακούσας παρεσκευάζοντο , οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι καὶ αὐτοὶ ὡς ἐπ’ ἐκείνους ἰόντες .
The following winter, the Athenians at once began to prepare for their advance upon Syracuse, and the Syracusans also, on their side, for marching against them.


6.63.2
4465
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ αὐτοῖς πρὸς τὸν πρῶτον φόβον καὶ τὴν προσδοκίαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οὐκ εὐθὺς ἐπέκειντο , κατά τε τὴν ἡμέραν ἑκάστην προϊοῦσαν ἀνεθάρσουν μᾶλλον καὶ ἐπειδὴ πλέοντές τε τὰ ἐπ’ ἐκεῖνα τῆς Σικελίας πολὺ ἀπὸ σφῶν ἐφαίνοντο καὶ πρὸς τὴν Ὕβλαν ἐλθόντες καὶ πειράσαντες οὐχ εἷλον βίᾳ , ἔτι πλέον κατεφρόνησαν καὶ ἠξίουν τοὺς στρατηγούς , οἷον δὴ ὄχλος φιλεῖ θαρσήσας ποιεῖν , ἄγειν σφᾶς ἐπὶ Κατάνην , ἐπειδὴ οὐκ ἐκεῖνοι ἐφ’ ἑαυτοὺς ἔρχονται .
For when they did not, in accordance with their first alarm and expectation, attack them immediately; as every day went on, they regained their courage more. And when they were seen to be sailing on the other side of Sicily, far away from them, and had gone to Hybla, and made an attempt on it without taking it by storm, they despised them still more, and called on their generals—acting as a multitude is wont to do when full of confidence—to lead them against Catana, since the enemy would not come to them.


6.63.3
4466
καὶ ἱππῆς προσελαύνοντες αἰεὶ κατάσκοποι τῶν Συρακοσίων πρὸς τὸ στράτευμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐφύβριζον ἄλλα τε καὶ εἰ ξυνοικήσοντες σφίσιν αὐτοὶ μᾶλλον ἥκοιεν ἐν τῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ ἢ Λεοντίνους ἐς τὴν οἰκείαν κατοικιοῦντες .
Moreover, Syracusan parties of horse, sent out to reconnoitre, were continually riding up to the Athenian armament, and asking them, amongst other insulting expressions, whether they had come themselves to settle with them in a strange country, rather than to reinstate the Leontini.


6.64.1
4467
ἃ γιγνώσκοντες οἱ στρατηγοὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ βουλόμενοι αὐτοὺς ἄγειν πανδημεὶ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὅτι πλεῖστον , αὐτοὶ δὲ ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐν τοσούτῳ ὑπὸ νύκτα παραπλεύσαντες στρατόπεδον καταλαμβάνειν ἐν ἐπιτηδείῳ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν , εἰδότες οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως δυνηθέντες καὶ εἰ ἐκ τῶν νεῶν πρὸς παρεσκευασμένους ἐκβιβάζοιεν ἢ κατὰ γῆν ἰόντες γνωσθεῖεν ( τοὺς γὰρ ἂν ψιλοὺς τοὺς σφῶν καὶ τὸν ὄχλον τῶν Συρακοσίων τοὺς ἱππέας πολλοὺς ὄντας , σφίσι δ’ οὐ παρόντων ἱππέων , βλάπτειν ἂν μεγάλα , οὕτω δὲ λήψεσθαι χωρίον ὅθεν ὑπὸ τῶν ἱππέων οὐ βλάψονται ἄξια λόγου ·
The Athenian generals were acquainted with these things, and wished to draw them as far as possible from their city with their whole force, and themselves, in the meantime, to coast along with their ships by night, and quietly occupy a place for encampment in a favourable position;


6.64.1
4468
ἐδίδασκον δ’ αὐτοὺς περὶ τοῦ πρὸς τῷ Ὀλυμπιείῳ χωρίου , ὅπερ καὶ κατέλαβον , Συρακοσίων φυγάδες , οἳ ξυνείποντο ) , τοιόνδε τι οὖν πρὸς ἃ ἐβούλοντο οἱ στρατηγοὶ μηχανῶνται .
knowing that so they would be better able to do it, than if they should land from their ships in face of an enemy prepared to receive them, or should be known to be going by land; (for the Syracusan horse, which was numerous, while they themselves had none, would do great mischief to their light-armed and mob of campfollowers;) and that thus they would take a position where they would not be annoyed by the cavalry in a degree worth speaking of; (for some Syracusan exiles who accompanied them told them of the spot near the Olympieum, which they actually occupied.) The generals, therefore, adopted the following stratagem in furtherance of their wishes.


6.64.2
4469
πέμπουσιν ἄνδρα σφίσι μὲν πιστόν , τοῖς δὲ τῶν Συρακοσίων στρατηγοῖς τῇ δοκήσει οὐχ ἧσσον ἐπιτήδειον ·
They send a person who was a faithful friend to them, and no less in the interest of the Syracusans, according to opinion.


6.64.2
4470
ἦν δὲ Καταναῖος ὁ ἀνήρ , καὶ ἀπ’ ἀνδρῶν ἐκ τῆς Κατάνης ἥκειν ἔφη ὧν ἐκεῖνοι τὰ ὀνόματα ἐγίγνωσκον καὶ ἠπίσταντο ἐν τῇ πόλει ἔτι ὑπολοίπους ὄντας τῶν σφίσιν εὔνων .
The man was a Catanian, and said that he was come from certain individuals in Catana, with whose names they were acquainted, and whom they knew to be still left in the town amongst those who were well affected to them. He stated, then, that the Athenians passed the night at some distance from their arms, within the walls of the city;


6.64.3
4471
ἔλεγε δὲ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους αὐλίζεσθαι ἀπὸ τῶν ὅπλων ἐν τῇ πόλει , καὶ εἰ βούλονται ἐκεῖνοι πανδημεὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ῥητῇ ἅμα ἕῳ ἐπὶ τὸ στράτευμα ἐλθεῖν , αὐτοὶ μὲν ἀποκλῄσειν τοὺς παρὰ σφίσι καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐμπρήσειν , ἐκείνους δὲ ῥᾳδίως τὸ στράτευμα προσβαλόντας τῷ σταυρώματι αἱρήσειν ·
and that if the Syracusans would come with all their force early in the morning of an appointed day to attack their armament, the Catanians would close the gates on the men who were with them, and would fire their ships; while the Syracusans would easily take the armament by an attack on their stockade.


6.64.3
4472
εἶναι δὲ ταῦτα τοὺς ξυνδράσοντας πολλοὺς Καταναίων καὶ ἡτοιμάσθαι ἤδη , ἀφ’ ὧν αὐτὸς ἥκειν .
There were many too of the Catanians, he said, who would co-operate with them in this, and were already prepared to do so; namely, the party from which he had himself come.


6.65.1
4473
οἱ δὲ στρατηγοὶ τῶν Συρακοσίων , μετὰ τοῦ καὶ ἐς τὰ ἄλλα θαρσεῖν καὶ εἶναι ἐν διανοίᾳ καὶ ἄνευ τούτων ἰέναι παρεσκευάσθαι ἐπὶ Κατάνην , ἐπίστευσάν τε τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ πολλῷ ἀπερισκεπτότερον καὶ εὐθὺς ἡμέραν ξυνθέμενοι ᾗ παρέσονται ἀπέστειλαν αὐτόν , καὶ αὐτοί ( ἤδη γὰρ καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων Σελινούντιοι καὶ ἄλλοι τινὲς παρῆσαν ) προεῖπον πανδημεὶ πᾶσιν ἐξιέναι Συρακοσίοις .
The generals of the Syracusans, besides feeling confident in other respects, and intending, even without this, to make their preparations for marching to Catana, gave far too inconsiderate credence to the man, and immediately fixing a day on which they would be there, dismissed him;


6.65.1
4474
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἑτοῖμα αὐτοῖς καὶ τὰ τῆς παρασκευῆς ἦν καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς ξυνέθεντο ἥξειν ἐγγὺς ἦσαν , πορευόμενοι ἐπὶ Κατάνης ηὐλίσαντο ἐπὶ τῷ Συμαίθῳ ποταμῷ ἐν τῇ Λεοντίνῃ .
while they themselves (for by this time the Selinuntines and some other of their allies had also come) gave orders for all the Syracusans to march forth in a body. When their preparations were made, and the time at which they had agreed to come was near at hand, they set out for Catana, and bivouacked on the river Symaethus, in the Leontine territory.


6.65.2
4475
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ὡς ᾔσθοντο αὐτοὺς προσιόντας , ἀναλαβόντες τό τε στράτευμα ἅπαν τὸ ἑαυτῶν καὶ ὅσοι Σικελῶν αὐτοῖς ἢ ἄλλος τις προσεληλύθει καὶ ἐπιβιβάσαντες ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς καὶ τὰ πλοῖα , ὑπὸ νύκτα ἔπλεον ἐπὶ τὰς Συρακούσας .
The Athenians, on learning their approach, took the whole of their own force, with such of the Sicels, or any other people, as had joined them, and putting them on board their ships and boats, sailed by night to Syracuse.


6.65.3
4476
καὶ οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι ἅμα ἕῳ ἐξέβαινον ἐς τὸ κατὰ τὸ Ὀλυμπιεῖον ὡς τὸ στρατόπεδον καταληψόμενοι , καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς οἱ Συρακοσίων πρῶτοι προσελάσαντες ἐς τὴν Κατάνην καὶ αἰσθόμενοι ὅτι τὸ στράτευμα ἅπαν ἀνῆκται , ἀποστρέψαντες ἀγγέλλουσι τοῖς πεζοῖς , καὶ ξύμπαντες ἤδη ἀποτρεπόμενοι ἐβοήθουν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν .
And thus, when the morning came, the Athenians were landing on the ground opposite the Olympieum, for the purpose of securing their camp; and at the same time the Syracusan cavalry, having ridden up first to Catana, and found that the whole armament had put to sea, returned and carried the news to the infantry, when they all turned back together, and went to the aid of the city.


6.66.1
4477
ἐν τούτῳ δ’ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , μακρᾶς οὔσης τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῖς , καθ’ ἡσυχίαν καθῖσαν τὸ στράτευμα ἐς χωρίον ἐπιτήδειον , καὶ ἐν ᾧ μάχης τε ἄρξειν ἔμελλον ὁπότε βούλοιντο καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς τῶν Συρακοσίων ἥκιστ’ ἂν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ καὶ πρὸ αὐτοῦ λυπήσειν ·
In the meantime, as the march they had to make was a long one, the Athenians quietly pitched their camp in a favourable position, where they would be able to commence an engagement just when they pleased, and the Syracusan horse would cause them the least annoyance, both during the action and before it.


6.66.1
4478
τῇ μὲν γὰρ τειχία τε καὶ οἰκίαι εἶργον καὶ δένδρα καὶ λίμνη , παρὰ δὲ τὸ κρημνοί .
For on one side they were flanked by walls, houses, trees, and a marsh; on the other, by cliffs.


6.66.2
4479
καὶ τὰ ἐγγὺς δένδρα κόψαντες καὶ κατενεγκόντες ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν παρά τε τὰς ναῦς σταύρωμα ἔπηξαν καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ Δάσκωνι ἔρυμά τι , ᾗ εὐεφοδώτατον ἦν τοῖς πολεμίοις , λίθοις λογάδην καὶ ξύλοις διὰ ταχέων ὤρθωσαν , καὶ τὴν τοῦ Ἀνάπου γέφυραν ἔλυσαν .
They also felled the trees near to them, and carrying them down to the sea, fixed a palisade by their ships; while with rude stones and wood they hastily erected a fort at Dasoon, where their position was most open to the enemy's attack, and broke down the bridge over the Anapus.


6.66.3
4480
παρασκευαζομένων δὲ ἐκ μὲν τῆς πόλεως οὐδεὶς ἐξιὼν ἐκώλυε , πρῶτοι δὲ οἱ ἱππῆς τῶν Συρακοσίων προσεβοήθησαν , ἔπειτα δὲ ὕστερον καὶ τὸ πεζὸν ἅπαν ξυνελέγη .
While they were making these preparations, no one came out from the city to stop them;


6.66.3
4481
καὶ προσῆλθον μὲν ἐγγὺς τοῦ στρατεύματος τῶν Ἀθηναίων τὸ πρῶτον , ἔπειτα δὲ ὡς οὐκ ἀντιπροῇσαν αὐτοῖς , ἀναχωρήσαντες καὶ διαβάντες τὴν Ἑλωρίνην ὁδὸν ηὐλίσαντο .
but the Syracusan cavalry was what first came against them, and afterwards all the infantry was mustered. And at first they advanced near the camp of the Athenians; then, when they did not go out against them, they withdrew, and crossed the road to Helorus, and there encamped for the night.


6.67.1
4482
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι παρεσκευάζοντο ὡς ἐς μάχην , καὶ ξυνετάξαντο ὧδε .
The next day the Athenians and their allies prepared for battle, and made their dispositions as follows.


6.67.1
4483
δεξιὸν μὲν κέρας Ἀργεῖοι εἶχον καὶ Μαντινῆς , Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ τὸ μέσον , τὸ δὲ ἄλλο οἱ ξύμμαχοι οἱ ἄλλοι .
The right wing was held by the Argives and Mantineans, the centre by the Athenians, and the remainder of the line by the rest of the allies.


6.67.1
4484
καὶ τὸ μὲν ἥμισυ αὐτοῖς τοῦ στρατεύματος ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν ἦν τεταγμένον ἐπὶ ὀκτώ , τὸ δὲ ἥμισυ ἐπὶ ταῖς εὐναῖς ἐν πλαισίῳ , ἐπὶ ὀκτὼ καὶ τοῦτο τεταγμένον ·
Half of their force was posted in advance, drawn up eight deep; the other half, close upon their tents, in a hollow square, which was also formed eight deep.


6.67.1
4485
οἷς εἴρητο , ᾗ ἂν τοῦ στρατεύματός τι πονῇ μάλιστα , ἐφορῶντας παραγίγνεσθαι .
They had orders  to look out where any part of the army might be most distressed, and go to its support.


6.67.1
4486
καὶ τοὺς σκευοφόρους ἐντὸς τούτων τῶν ἐπιτάκτων ἐποιήσαντο .
Within this body of reserve, too, they placed the camp-followers.


6.67.2
4487
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι ἔταξαν τοὺς μὲν ὁπλίτας πάντας ἐφ’ ἑκκαίδεκα , ὄντας πανδημεὶ Συρακοσίους καὶ ὅσοι ξύμμαχοι παρῆσαν ( ἐβοήθησαν δὲ αὐτοῖς Σελινούντιοι μὲν μάλιστα , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ Γελῴων ἱππῆς , τὸ ξύμπαν ἐς διακοσίους , καὶ Καμαριναίων ἱππῆς ὅσον εἴκοσι καὶ τοξόται ὡς πεντήκοντα ) , τοὺς δὲ ἱππέας ἐπετάξαντο ἐπὶ τῷ δεξιῷ , οὐκ ἔλασσον ὄντας ἢ διακοσίους καὶ χιλίους , παρὰ δ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἀκοντιστάς .
The Syracusans, on the other hand, drew up their heavy infantry sixteen deep, consisting of the Syracusans in full force, and as many allies as had joined them: (they were reinforced most extensively by the Selinuntines; next to them, by the Geloan cavalry, to the number of two hundred in all; and by about twenty horse, and fifty archers, from Camarina.) Their cavalry they posted on their right flank, amounting to not less than twelve hundred, and by their side the dartmen also.


6.67.3
4488
μέλλουσι δὲ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις προτέροις ἐπιχειρήσειν ὁ Νικίας κατά τε ἔθνη ἐπιπαριὼν ἕκαστα καὶ ξύμπασι τοιάδε παρεκελεύετο .
The Athenians being about to commence the attack, Nicias advanced along the line, and addressed the following exhortation to them, both in their several nations, and collectively:


6.68.1
4489
&quot; Πολλῇ μὲν παραινέσει , ὦ ἄνδρες , τί δεῖ χρῆσθαι , οἳ πάρεσμεν ἐπὶ τὸν αὐτὸν ἀγῶνα ;
" What need is there, soldiers, that we should have recourse to long exhortation, who are come here for the same struggle?


6.68.1
4490
αὐτὴ γὰρ ἡ παρασκευὴ ἱκανωτέρα μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι θάρσος παρασχεῖν ἢ καλῶς λεχθέντες λόγοι μετὰ ἀσθενοῦς στρατοπέδου .
For our force itself seems to me more capable of supplying confidence, than well-spoken words with a weak army."


6.68.2
4491
ὅπου γὰρ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ Μαντινῆς καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ νησιωτῶν οἱ πρῶτοί ἐσμεν , πῶς οὐ χρὴ μετὰ τοιῶνδε καὶ τοσῶνδε ξυμμάχων πάντα τινὰ μεγάλην τὴν ἐλπίδα τῆς νίκης ἔχειν , ἄλλως τε καὶ πρὸς ἄνδρας πανδημεί τε ἀμυνομένους καὶ οὐκ ἀπολέκτους ὥσπερ καὶ ἡμᾶς , καὶ προσέτι Σικελιώτας , οἳ ὑπερφρονοῦσι μὲν ἡμᾶς , ὑπομενοῦσι δ’ οὔ , διὰ τὸ τὴν ἐπιστήμην τῆς τόλμης ἥσσω ἔχειν .
" For where we have in the field Argives, Mantineans, Athenians, and the prime of the islanders, on what grounds ought we not, with allies so brave and numerous, to entertain every one a strong hope of victory? especially as we are opposed to men who are defending themselves in a promiscuous crowd, and not chosen troops, as we are; and moreover, against Siceliots, who despise us indeed, but will not receive our attack, because they have less skill in arms than boldness. Let this thought too be entertained by each of you;"


6.68.3
4492
παραστήτω δέ τινι καὶ τόδε , πολύ τε ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμετέρας αὐτῶν εἶναι καὶ πρὸς γῇ οὐδεμιᾷ φιλίᾳ , ἥντινα μὴ αὐτοὶ μαχόμενοι κτήσεσθε .
" that we are far from our own land, and with no friendly country near us, but such as yourselves win by fighting.


6.68.3
4493
καὶ τ- ἐναντίον ὑπομιμνῄσκω ὑμᾶς ἢ οἱ πολέμιοι σφίσιν αὐτοῖς εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι παρακελεύονται ·
And so I offer to you an admonition, the very reverse of the exhortation which our enemies are, I well know, addressing to each other.


6.68.3
4494
οἱ μὲν γὰρ ὅτι περὶ πατρίδος ἔσται ὁ ἀγών , ἐγὼ δὲ ὅτι οὐκ ἐν πατρίδι , ἐξ ἧς κρατεῖν δεῖ ἢ μὴ ῥᾳδίως ἀποχωρεῖν ·
For they are urging, that the battle will be for their country; but I, that it will be fought in what is not our country, but where you must conquer, or not easily get away:


6.68.3
4495
οἱ γὰρ ἱππῆς πολλοὶ ἐπικείσονται .
for their cavalry will press upon us in great numbers."


6.68.4

τῆς τε οὖν ὑμετέρας αὐτῶν ἀξίας μνησθέντες ἐπέλθετε τοῖς ἐναντίοις προθύμως , καὶ τὴν παροῦσαν ἀνάγκην καὶ ἀπορίαν φοβερωτέραν ἡγησάμενοι τῶν πολεμίων &quot; .
" Remembering then your own high character, make a spirited attack on your opponents, and regard your present necessity and difficulties as more formidable than the enemy."


6.69.1
4497
ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοιαῦτα παρακελευσάμενος ἐπῆγε τὸ στρατόπεδον εὐθύς .
Nicias delivered this address, and immediately led on his troops.


6.69.1
4498
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι ἀπροσδόκητοι μὲν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ ἦσαν ὡς ἤδη μαχούμενοι , καί τινες αὐτοῖς ἐγγὺς τῆς πόλεως οὔσης καὶ ἀπεληλύθεσαν ·
As for the Syracusans, they were not expecting to engage at present, and some of them, as their city was close at hand, had actually gone away to it;


6.69.1
4499
οἱ δὲ καὶ διὰ σπουδῆς προσβοηθοῦντες δρόμῳ ὑστέριζον μέν , ὡς δὲ ἕκαστός πῃ τοῖς πλέοσι προσμείξειε καθίσταντο .
and these, although they went to the aid of their comrades in haste, and at a full run, were too late [to take their proper place in the ranks,] but posted themselves as each one came up to the main body.


6.69.1
4500
οὐ γὰρ δὴ προθυμίᾳ ἐλλιπεῖς ἦσαν οὐδὲ τόλμῃ οὔτ’ ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ μάχῃ οὔτ’ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις , ἀλλὰ τῇ μὲν ἀνδρείᾳ οὐχ ἥσσους ἐς ὅσον ἡ ἐπιστήμη ἀντέχοι , τῷ δὲ ἐλλείποντι αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν βούλησιν ἄκοντες προυδίδοσαν .
For in truth they were not deficient in zeal, or in daring, neither in this battle, nor in the others; but though not inferior in courage, so far as their military science served, yet in consequence of that failing them they reluctantly abandoned their resolution also.


6.69.1
4501
ὅμως δὲ οὐκ ἂν οἰόμενοι σφίσι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους προτέρους ἐπελθεῖν καὶ διὰ τάχους ἀναγκαζόμενοι ἀμύνασθαι , ἀναλαβόντες τὰ ὅπλα εὐθὺς ἀντεπῇσαν .
Although therefore, as I have said, they did not imagine that the Athenians would be the first to make an attack, and although they were compelled to defend themselves on a short warning, they took up their arms, and immediately advanced to meet them.


6.69.2
4502
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν αὐτῶν ἑκατέρων οἵ τε λιθοβόλοι καὶ σφενδονῆται καὶ τοξόται προυμάχοντο καὶ τροπὰς οἵας εἰκὸς ψιλοὺς ἀλλήλων ἐποίουν ·
And in the first place the stone-throwers, and slingers, and archers on each side began skirmishing, and successively routed each other, as light troops might be expected to do.


6.69.2
4503
ἔπειτα δὲ μάντεις τε σφάγια προύφερον τὰ νομιζόμενα καὶ σαλπιγκταὶ ξύνοδον ἐπώτρυνον τοῖς ὁπλίταις , οἱ δ’ ἐχώρουν , Συρακόσιοι μὲν περί τε πατρίδος μαχούμενοι καὶ τῆς ἰδίας ἕκαστος τὸ μὲν αὐτίκα σωτηρίας , τὸ δὲ μέλλον ἐλευθερίας , τῶν δ’ ἐναντίων Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν περί τε τῆς ἀλλοτρίας οἰκείαν σχεῖν καὶ τὴν οἰκείαν μὴ βλάψαι ἡσσώμενοι , Ἀργεῖοι δὲ καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων οἱ αὐτόνομοι ξυγκτήσασθαί τε ἐκείνοις ἐφ’ ἃ ἦλθον καὶ τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν σφίσι πατρίδα νικήσαντες πάλιν ἐπιδεῖν ·
Then there were priests bringing forward the usual victims for sacrifice, and trumpeters stirring on the heavy-armed to the charge.


6.69.3
4504
τὸ δ’ ὑπήκοον τῶν ξυμμάχων μέγιστον μὲν περὶ τῆς αὐτίκα ἀνελπίστου σωτηρίας , ἢν μὴ κρατῶσι , τὸ πρόθυμον εἶχον , ἔπειτα δὲ ἐν παρέργῳ καὶ εἴ τι ἄλλο ξυγκαταστρεψαμένοις ῥᾷον αὐτοῖς ὑπακούσεται .
And so they advanced; the Syracusans, to fight for their country, and their own personal safety at present, and freedom in future;— the Athenians, on the side of their opponents, to fight for another people's land, that they might win it as their own; and to avoid weakening their own by defeat;—the Argives and the independent allies, to join them in securing the objects they had come for, and by means of victory to look again on the country that was already theirs;—while the subject allies showed a ready zeal, most of all, for their immediate safety, which was hopeless unless they conquered; then, as a secondary consideration, for the chance of serving on easier terms, in consequence of having assisted to reduce a fresh country under the Athenian dominion.


6.70.1
4505
γενομένης δ’ ἐν χερσὶ τῆς μάχης ἐπὶ πολὺ ἀντεῖχον ἀλλήλοις , καὶ ξυνέβη βροντάς τε ἅμα τινὰς γενέσθαι καὶ ἀστραπὰς καὶ ὕδωρ πολύ , ὥστε τοῖς μὲν πρῶτον μαχομένοις καὶ ἐλάχιστα πολέμῳ ὡμιληκόσι καὶ τοῦτο ξυνεπιλαβέσθαι τοῦ φόβου , τοῖς δ’ ἐμπειροτέροις τὰ μὲν γιγνόμενα καὶ ὥρᾳ ἔτους περαίνεσθαι δοκεῖν , τοὺς δὲ ἀνθεστῶτας πολὺ μείζω ἔκπληξιν μὴ νικωμένους παρέχειν .
When they had come to close combat, they withstood each other's attacks for a long time. And there happened to come on at once both thunder, and lightning, and heavy rain: so that to those who were fighting for the first time, and had had very little acquaintance with war, even this helped to increase their fear; while to the more experienced party these occurrences appeared to be produced simply by the season of the year, but the fact of their opponents not being defeated caused far greater alarm.


6.70.2
4506
ὠσαμένων δὲ τῶν Ἀργείων πρῶτον τὸ εὐώνυμον κέρας τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ μετ’ αὐτοὺς τῶν Ἀθηναίων τὸ κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτούς , παρερρήγνυτο ἤδη καὶ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ἐς φυγὴν κατέστη .
But when the Argives had first driven in the left wing of the Syracusans, and after them the Athenians had repulsed those opposed to them, the rest of the Syracusan army was now also broken and put to flight.


6.70.3
4507
καὶ ἐπὶ πολὺ μὲν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ( οἱ γὰρ ἱππῆς τῶν Συρακοσίων πολλοὶ ὄντες καὶ ἀήσσητοι εἶργον , καὶ ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τοὺς ὁπλίτας αὐτῶν , εἴ τινας προδιώκοντας ἴδοιεν , ἀνέστελλον ) , ἐπακολουθήσαντες δὲ ἁθρόοι ὅσον ἀσφαλῶς εἶχε πάλιν ἐπανεχώρουν καὶ τροπαῖον ἵστασαν .
The Athenians did not pursue them to any great distance, (for the Syracusan horse, which was numerous and unbroken, kept them in check, and by charging their heavy infantry, wherever they saw any pursuing in advance of the rest, drove them back again.) However they followed them in a body as far as was safe, and then returned again, and erected a trophy.


6.70.4
4508
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι ἁθροισθέντες ἐς τὴν Ἑλωρίνην ὁδὸν καὶ ὡς ἐκ τῶν παρόντων ξυνταξάμενοι ἔς τε τὸ Ὀλυμπιεῖον ὅμως σφῶν αὐτῶν παρέπεμψαν φυλακήν , δείσαντες μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τῶν χρημάτων ἃ ἦν αὐτόθι κινήσωσι , καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ ἐπανεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν πόλιν .
The Syracusans, on the other hand, having collected themselves again on the Helorine road, and put themselves in as good order as present circumstances would permit, sent, notwithstanding their defeat, a garrison to the Olympieum, fearing that the Athenians might take some of the treasures that were there; while the rest of them returned into the city.


6.71.1
4509
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι πρὸς μὲν τὸ ἱερὸν οὐκ ἦλθον , ξυγκομίσαντες δὲ τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκροὺς καὶ ἐπὶ πυρὰν ἐπιθέντες ηὐλίσαντο αὐτοῦ .
The Athenians, however, did not go to the temple, but after carrying their own dead together, and laying them on a funeral pile, passed the night on the ground.


6.71.1
4510
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ τοῖς μὲν Συρακοσίοις ἀπέδοσαν ὑποσπόνδους τοὺς νεκρούς ( ἀπέθανον δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων περὶ ἑξήκοντα καὶ διακοσίους ) , τῶν δὲ σφετέρων τὰ ὀστᾶ ξυνέλεξαν ( ἀπέθανον δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὡς πεντήκοντα ) , καὶ τὰ τῶν πολεμίων σκῦλα ἔχοντες ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς Κατάνην ·
The next day they restored to the Syracusans their dead, under a truce. (there had fallen, of them and their allies, about two hundred and sixty,) and collected the bones of their own, (about fifty of themselves and their allies having been killed,) and with the spoils of the enemy sailed back to Catana.


6.71.2
4511
χειμών τε γὰρ ἦν , καὶ τὸν πόλεμον αὐτόθεν ποιεῖσθαι οὔπω ἐδόκει δυνατὸν εἶναι , πρὶν ἂν ἱππέας τε μεταπέμψωσιν ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν καὶ ἐκ τῶν αὐτόθεν ξυμμάχων ἀγείρωσιν , ὅπως μὴ παντάπασιν ἱπποκρατῶνται , καὶ χρήματα δὲ ἅμα αὐτόθεν τε ξυλλέξωνται καὶ παρ’ Ἀθηναίων ἔλθῃ , τῶν τε πόλεών τινας προσαγάγωνται , ἃς ἤλπιζον μετὰ τὴν μάχην μᾶλλον σφῶν ὑπακούσεσθαι , τά τε ἄλλα καὶ σῖτον καὶ ὅσων δέοι παρασκευάσωνται ὡς ἐς τὸ ἔαρ ἐπιχειρήσοντες ταῖς Συρακούσαις .
For it was winter, and they thought it impossible at present to carry on war before Syracuse, till they had sent for cavalry from Athens, and also raised some from their allies in the country, to avoid being utterly defeated by the enemy's horse. They wished too, at the same time, to collect money in the island, and to get a supply from Athens; as also to win over some of the cities to their cause, which they hoped would more readily listen to them after the battle; and to provide themselves with corn and every thing else they might require, with a view to attacking Syracuse in the spring.


6.72.1
4512
καὶ οἱ μὲν ταύτῃ τῇ γνώμῃ ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς τὴν Νάξον καὶ Κατάνην διαχειμάσοντες , Συρακόσιοι δὲ τοὺς σφετέρους αὐτῶν νεκροὺς θάψαντες ἐκκλησίαν ἐποίουν .
They, then, with these intentions sailed off to Naxos and Catana, for the winter. The Syracusans, on the other hand, after burying their dead, held an assembly.


6.72.2
4513
καὶ παρελθὼν αὐτοῖς Ἑρμοκράτης ὁ Ἕρμωνος , ἀνὴρ καὶ ἐς τ- ἄλλα ξύνεσιν οὐδενὸς λειπόμενος καὶ κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἐμπειρίᾳ τε ἱκανὸς γενόμενος καὶ ἀνδρείᾳ ἐπιφανής , ἐθάρσυνέ τε καὶ οὐκ εἴα τῷ γεγενημένῳ ἐνδιδόναι ·
And now came forward to them Hermocrates son of Hermon, a man at once second to none in general intelligence, and who had proved himself able in war through his experience, and a person of signal bravery. He encouraged them, and told them " not to submit in consequence of what had happened;"


6.72.3
4514
τὴν μὲν γὰρ γνώμην αὐτῶν οὐχ ἡσσῆσθαι , τὴν δὲ ἀταξίαν βλάψαι .
for it was not their spirit that was vanquished, but their want of discipline that had been so injurious.


6.72.3
4515
οὐ μέντοι τοσοῦτόν γε λειφθῆναι ὅσον εἰκὸς εἶναι , ἄλλως τε καὶ τοῖς πρώτοις τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐμπειρίᾳ ἰδιώτας ὡς εἰπεῖν χειροτέχναις ἀνταγωνισαμένους .
They had not, however, been so much inferior to their enemies as might have been expected; especially since they had been matched against the first of the Greeks— mere amateurs, so to speak, against regular workmen."


6.72.4
4516
μέγα δὲ βλάψαι καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν στρατηγῶν καὶ τὴν πολυαρχίαν ( ἦσαν γὰρ πέντε καὶ δέκα οἱ στρατηγοὶ αὐτοῖς ) τῶν τε πολλῶν τὴν ἀξύντακτον ἀναρχίαν .
They had also been much hurt by the great number of their generals and the multiplicity of orders, (for their generals were fifteen in number,) and also by the tumultuous insubordination of the troops in general.


6.72.4
4517
ἢν δὲ ὀλίγοι τε στρατηγοὶ γένωνται ἔμπειροι καὶ ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ παρασκευάσωσι τὸ ὁπλιτικόν , οἷς τε ὅπλα μὴ ἔστιν ἐκπορίζοντες , ὅπως ὡς πλεῖστοι ἔσονται , καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ μελέτῃ προσαναγκάζοντες , ἔφη κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς κρατήσειν σφᾶς τῶν ἐναντίων , ἀνδρείας μὲν σφίσιν ὑπαρχούσης , εὐταξίας δ’ ἐς τὰ ἔργα προσγενομένης ·
But should only a few men of experience be elected generals, and prepare their heavy-armed force for service during that winter, by furnishing with arms those who did not possess any, in order that they might be as numerous as possible, and by compelling them to attend to their training also;


6.72.4
4518
ἐπιδώσειν γὰρ ἀμφότερα αὐτά , τὴν μὲν μετὰ κινδύνων μελετωμένην , τὴν δ’ εὐψυχίαν αὐτὴν ἑαυτῆς μετὰ τοῦ πιστοῦ τῆς ἐπιστήμης θαρσαλεωτέραν ἔσεσθαι .
they would, he said, in all probability have the advantage over their enemies; since courage they already possessed, and discipline for the execution of their measures would thus have been acquired. For both these things would improve; their discipline being practised in the midst of dangers; and their courage growing more confident than ever from being accompanied by the assurance of science."


6.72.5
4519
τούς τε στρατηγοὺς καὶ ὀλίγους καὶ αὐτοκράτορας χρῆναι ἑλέσθαι καὶ ὀμόσαι αὐτοῖς τὸ ὅρκιον ἦ μὴν ἐάσειν ἄρχειν ὅπῃ ἂν ἐπίστωνται ·
They ought, then, to elect their generals both few in number and invested with absolute authority; taking to them the oath, 'that assuredly they would allow them to command as they might think best.'


6.72.5
4520
οὕτω γὰρ ἅ τε κρύπτεσθαι δεῖ μᾶλλον ἂν στέγεσθαι καὶ τ- ἄλλα κατὰ κόσμον καὶ ἀπροφασίστως παρασκευασθῆναι .
For so what ought to be kept secret would be more effectually concealed; and everything else would be prepared in due order and without listening to any excuses."


6.73.1
4521
καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι αὐτοῦ ἀκούσαντες ἐψηφίσαντό τε πάντα ὡς ἐκέλευε καὶ στρατηγὸν αὐτόν τε εἵλοντο τὸν Ἑρμοκράτη καὶ Ἡρακλείδην τὸν Λυσιμάχου καὶ Σικανὸν τὸν Ἐξηκέστου , τούτους τρεῖς , καὶ ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πρέσβεις ἀπέστειλαν , ὅπως ξυμμαχία τε αὐτοῖς παραγένηται καὶ τὸν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους πόλεμον βεβαιότερον πείθωσι ποιεῖσθαι ἐκ τοῦ προφανοῦς ὑπὲρ σφῶν τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , ἵνα ἢ ἀπὸ τῆς Σικελίας ἀπαγάγωσιν αὐτοὺς ἢ πρὸς τὸ ἐν Σικελίᾳ στράτευμα ἧσσον ὠφελίαν ἄλλην ἐπιπέμπωσιν .
The Syracusans, after hearing his speech, voted every thing as he advised; and elected Hermocrates himself as general, with Heraclides son of Lysimachus, and Sicanus son of Execestes, these three.


6.74.1
4522
τὸ δ’ ἐν τῇ Κατάνῃ στράτευμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἔπλευσεν εὐθὺς ἐπὶ Μεσσήνην ὡς προδοθησομένην .
As for the Athenian forces at Catana, they sailed immediately to Messana, in expectation of its being betrayed to them.


6.74.1
4523
καὶ ἃ μὲν ἐπράσσετο οὐκ ἐγένετο ·
But the intrigues that were being carried on did not come to anything.


6.74.1
4524
Ἀλκιβιάδης γὰρ ὅτ’ ἀπῄει ἐκ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἤδη μετάπεμπτος , ἐπιστάμενος ὅτι φεύξοιτο , μηνύει τοῖς τῶν Συρακοσίων φίλοις τοῖς ἐν τῇ Μεσσήνῃ ξυνειδὼς τὸ μέλλον ·
For Alcibiades, when he was now summoned home, and had left his command, knowing that he would be outlawed, gave information of the intended movement, to which he was privy, to the friends of the Syracusans in Messana;


6.74.1
4525
οἱ δὲ τούς τε ἄνδρας διέφθειραν πρότερον καὶ τότε στασιάζοντες καὶ ἐν ὅπλοις ὄντες ἐπεκράτουν μὴ δέχεσθαι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οἱ ταῦτα βουλόμενοι .
and they had both previously put to death the men implicated in it, and at that time such as were on the same side, breaking out into sedition, and taking up arms, prevailed so far as to prevent their admitting the Athenians.


6.74.2
4526
ἡμέρας δὲ μείναντες περὶ τρεῖς καὶ δέκα οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὡς ἐχειμάζοντο καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια οὐκ εἶχον καὶ προυχώρει οὐδέν , ἀπελθόντες ἐς Νάξον καὶ ὅρια καὶ σταυρώματα περὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ποιησάμενοι αὐτοῦ διεχείμαζον ·
When they, therefore, after staying ten days, were suffering from the severe weather, had no provisions, and found none of their plans succeed, they retired to Naxos, and having made a palisade round their encampment, took up their winter quarters there.


6.74.2
4527
καὶ τριήρη ἀπέστειλαν ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἐπί τε χρήματα καὶ ἱππέας , ὅπως ἅμα τῷ ἦρι παραγένωνται .
They also sent a trireme to Athens for both money and cavalry, to join them in the spring.


6.75.1
4528
ἐτείχιζον δὲ καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι πρός τε τῇ πόλει , τὸν Τεμενίτην ἐντὸς ποιησάμενοι , τεῖχος παρὰ πᾶν τὸ πρὸς τὰς Ἐπιπολὰς ὁρῶν , ὅπως μὴ δι’ ἐλάσσονος εὐαποτείχιστοι ὦσιν , ἢν ἄρα σφάλλωνται , καὶ τὰ Μέγαρα φρούριον , καὶ ἐν τῷ Ὀλυμπιείῳ ἄλλο ·
The Syracusans, on their part, both built in the course of the winter a wall to their city, along the whole quarter looking towards Epipolae, including the Temenites. to prevent their being circumvallated so easily as they would with a less circuit, in case of their being defeated;


6.75.1
4529
καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν προυσταύρωσαν πανταχῇ ᾗ ἀποβάσεις ἦσαν .
and also fortified Megara as an out-post, and another in the Olympieum. They fixed palisades, too, along the edge of the sea, at all points where there were facilities for landing.


6.75.2
4530
καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους εἰδότες ἐν τῇ Νάξῳ χειμάζοντας ἐστράτευσαν πανδημεὶ ἐπὶ τὴν Κατάνην , καὶ τῆς τε γῆς αὐτῶν ἔτεμον καὶ τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων σκηνὰς καὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐμπρήσαντες ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
And as they knew that the Athenians were wintering at Naxos, they marched in full force to Catana, and both ravaged part of their land, and after burning the tents and encampment of the Athenians, returned home.


6.75.3
4531
καὶ πυνθανόμενοι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐς τὴν Καμάριναν κατὰ τὴν ἐπὶ Λάχητος γενομένην ξυμμαχίαν πρεσβεύεσθαι , εἴ πως προσαγάγοιντο αὐτούς , ἀντεπρεσβεύοντο καὶ αὐτοί ·
Hearing, moreover, that the Athenians were sending an embassy to Camarina, on the strength of that alliance concluded under Laches, to try if by any means they might win them over to their side, the Syracusans also sent a counter-embassy.


6.75.3
4532
ἦσαν γὰρ ὕποπτοι αὐτοῖς οἱ Καμαριναῖοι μὴ προθύμως σφίσι μήτ’ ἐπὶ τὴν πρώτην μάχην πέμψαι ἃ ἔπεμψαν , ἔς τε τὸ λοιπὸν μὴ οὐκέτι βούλωνται ἀμύνειν , ὁρῶντες τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐν τῇ μάχῃ εὖ πράξαντας , προσχωρῶσι δ’ αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὴν προτέραν φιλίαν πεισθέντες .
For they had suspicions of the Camarinaeans, both that they had not sent heartily what they sent to join in the first battle; and that for the future they would not wish to assist them any more, since they saw that the Athenians had been successful in the engagement, but would be persuaded to join the invaders on the strength of their former friendship.


6.75.4
4533
ἀφικομένων οὖν ἐκ μὲν Συρακουσῶν Ἑρμοκράτους καὶ ἄλλων ἐς τὴν Καμάριναν , ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων Εὐφήμου μεθ’ ἑτέρων , ὁ Ἑρμοκράτης ξυλλόγου γενομένου τῶν Καμαριναίων βουλόμενος προδιαβάλλειν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἔλεγε τοιάδε .
On the arrival therefore at Camarina of Hermocrates and some others from Syracuse, and of Euphemus and others from the Athenians, an assembly of the Camarinaeans having been convened, Hermocrates, wishing to prejudice them beforehand against the Athenians, addressed them as follows:


6.76.1
4534
&quot; οὐ τὴν παροῦσαν δύναμιν τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὦ Καμαριναῖοι , μὴ αὐτὴν καταπλαγῆτε δείσαντες ἐπρεσβευσάμεθα , ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον τοὺς μέλλοντας ἀπ’ αὐτῶν λόγους , πρίν τι καὶ ἡμῶν ἀκοῦσαι , μὴ ὑμᾶς πείσωσιν .
"It was not, Camarinaeans, from any fear of your being terrified at the present forces of the Athenians that we came on this embassy, but rather from apprehension that the words which would be spoken by them before you heard any thing from us might prevail upon you.


6.76.2
4535
ἥκουσι γὰρ ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν προφάσει μὲν ᾗ πυνθάνεσθε , διανοίᾳ δὲ ἣν πάντες ὑπονοοῦμεν ·
For they are come to Sicily on the pretext, indeed, which you hear, but with the purpose which we all suspect;


6.76.2
4536
καί μοι δοκοῦσιν οὐ Λεοντίνους βούλεσθαι κατοικίσαι , ἀλλ’ ἡμᾶς μᾶλλον ἐξοικίσαι .
and, in my opinion, they are wishing, not to restore the Leontines to their home, but to eject us from ours.


6.76.2
4537
οὐ γὰρ δὴ εὔλογον τὰς μὲν ἐκεῖ πόλεις ἀναστάτους ποιεῖν , τὰς δὲ ἐνθάδε κατοικίζειν , καὶ Λεοντίνων μὲν Χαλκιδέων ὄντων κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς κήδεσθαι , Χαλκιδέας δὲ τοὺς ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ , ὧν οἵδε ἄποικοί εἰσι , δουλωσαμένους ἔχειν .
For surely it is not consistent that they should depopulate the cities in Greece, but re-settle those in Sicily; and that they should care for the Leontines, who are Chalcidians, because of their connexion with them, but keep in slavery the Chalcidians in Euboea, from whom these are a colony.


6.76.3
4538
τῇ δὲ αὐτῇ ἰδέᾳ ἐκεῖνά τε ἔσχον καὶ τὰ ἐνθάδε νῦν πειρῶνται ·
But the method is the same, by which they both gained possession of those places, and are attempting to do so with these.


6.76.3
4539
ἡγεμόνες γὰρ γενόμενοι ἑκόντων τῶν τε Ἰώνων καὶ ὅσοι ἀπὸ σφῶν ἦσαν ξύμμαχοι ὡς ἐπὶ τοῦ Μήδου τιμωρίᾳ , τοὺς μὲν λιποστρατίαν , τοὺς δὲ ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους στρατεύειν , τοῖς δ’ ὡς ἑκάστοις τινὰ εἶχον αἰτίαν εὐπρεπῆ ἐπενεγκόντες κατεστρέψαντο .
For after they had been appointed leaders, by the free choice both of the Ionians and of all who were of Athenian origin, for the purpose of taking vengeance on the Mede; by charging some of them with failure in military service, others with mutual hostilities, and others on any specious plea which they severally had to urge, they reduced them to subjection.


6.76.4
4540
καὶ οὐ περὶ τῆς ἐλευθερίας ἄρα οὔτε οὗτοι τῶν Ἑλλήνων οὔθ’ οἱ Ἕλληνες τῆς ἑαυτῶν τῷ Μήδῳ ἀντέστησαν , περὶ δὲ οἱ μὲν σφίσιν ἀλλὰ μὴ ἐκείνῳ καταδουλώσεως , οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ δεσπότου μεταβολῇ οὐκ ἀξυνετωτέρου , κακοξυνετωτέρου δέ .
And so they did not withstand the Mede for the sake of liberty—neither these men for that of the Greeks, nor the Greeks for their own—but the former did it to enslave the Greeks to themselves, instead of to the Mede; the latter, to get a new master, one not more unwise, but more wise for evil.


6.77.1
4541
&quot; ἀλλ’ οὐ γὰρ δὴ τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων εὐκατηγόρητον οὖσαν πόλιν νῦν ἥκομεν ἀποφανοῦντες ἐν εἰδόσιν ὅσα ἀδικεῖ , πολὺ δὲ μᾶλλον ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς αἰτιασόμενοι ὅτι ἔχοντες παραδείγματα τῶν τ’ ἐκεῖ Ἑλλήνων ὡς ἐδουλώθησαν οὐκ ἀμύνοντες σφίσιν αὐτοῖς , καὶ νῦν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς τ- αὐτὰ παρόντα σοφίσματα , Λεοντίνων τε ξυγγενῶν κατοικίσεις καὶ Ἐγεσταίων ξυμμάχων ἐπικουρίας , οὐ ξυστραφέντες βουλόμεθα προθυμότερον δεῖξαι αὐτοῖς ὅτι οὐκ Ἴωνες τάδε εἰσὶν οὐδ’ Ἑλλησπόντιοι καὶ νησιῶται , οἳ δεσπότην ἢ Μῆδον ἢ ἕνα γέ τινα αἰεὶ μεταβάλλοντες δουλοῦνται , ἀλλὰ Δωριῆς ἐλεύθεροι ἀπ’ αὐτονόμου τῆς Πελοποννήσου τὴν Σικελίαν οἰκοῦντες .
"But, open as the Athenian state is to accusation, we are not come at the present time to prove before those who know this already, in how many respects it is committing injustice; but much rather to censure ourselves, because, with the warnings given us by the Greeks in those quarters, how they were enslaved through not assisting one another, and with the same sophisms being now practised on ourselves— their re-instatements of their Leontine kinsmen, and succours to their Segestan allies—we will not unite together, and show them that the people here are no Ionians, or Hellespontines and islanders, who are always passing to a new master, either the Mede or some one else, and still kept in slavery, but free Dorians from the independent Peloponnese now living in Sicily.


6.77.2
4542
ἢ μένομεν ἕως ἂν ἕκαστοι κατὰ πόλεις ληφθῶμεν , εἰδότες ὅτι ταύτῃ μόνον ἁλωτοί ἐσμεν καὶ ὁρῶντες αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τοῦτο τὸ εἶδος τρεπομένους ὥστε τοὺς μὲν λόγοις ἡμῶν διιστάναι , τοὺς δὲ ξυμμάχων ἐλπίδι ἐκπολεμοῦν πρὸς ἀλλήλους , τοῖς δὲ ὡς ἑκάστοις τι προσηνὲς λέγοντες δύνανται κακουργεῖν ;
Or do we wait till we have separately been subdued, city by city? knowing, as we do, that in this way only are we vincible; and seeing them having recourse to this method, so as to set some of us at variance by words; to set others at war through hope of finding allies; and to injure others by saying something flattering to them, as they severally can.


6.77.2
4543
καὶ οἰόμεθα τοῦ ἄπωθεν ξυνοίκου προαπολλυμένου οὐ καὶ ἐς αὐτόν τινα ἥξειν τὸ δεινόν , πρὸ δὲ αὐτοῦ μᾶλλον τὸν πάσχοντα καθ’ ἑαυτὸν δυστυχεῖν ;
And do we then think, that if our distant fellow countryman is destroyed before us, the danger will not come to each of ourselves also, but that he who suffers before us keeps his misfortune to himself?


6.78.1
4544
καὶ εἴ τῳ ἄρα παρέστηκε τὸν μὲν Συρακόσιον , ἑαυτὸν δ’ οὒ πολέμιον εἶναι τῷ Ἀθηναίῳ , καὶ δεινὸν ἡγεῖται ὑπέρ γε τῆς ἐμῆς κινδυνεύειν , ἐνθυμηθήτω οὐ περὶ τῆς ἐμῆς μᾶλλον , ἐν ἴσῳ δὲ καὶ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ ἅμα ἐν τῇ ἐμῇ μαχούμενος , τοσούτῳ δὲ καὶ ἀσφαλέστερον ὅσῳ οὐ προδιεφθαρμένου ἐμοῦ , ἔχων δὲ ξύμμαχον ἐμὲ καὶ οὐκ ἐρῆμος ἀγωνιεῖται ·
If, again, the thought has presented itself to any one, that although the Syracusans are hostile to the Athenians, he himself is not; and if he consider it a hardship to incur dangers for our country, let him reflect that it is not for ours especially, but in like manner for his own also that he will fight in ours; and that he will do it with proportionately greater safety, inasmuch as he will not enter on the struggle after we have been first ruined, but with us for allies, and not left by himself.


6.78.1
4545
τόν τε Ἀθηναῖον μὴ τὴν τοῦ Συρακοσίου ἔχθραν κολάσασθαι , τῇ δ’ ἐμῇ προφάσει τὴν ἐκείνου φιλίαν οὐχ ἧσσον βεβαιώσασθαι βούλεσθαι .
And let him consider that the wish of the Athenians is, not to chastise our enmity, but, making us their excuse, to secure no less his own friendship.


6.78.2
4546
εἴ τέ τις φθονεῖ μὲν ἢ καὶ φοβεῖται ( ἀμφότερα γὰρ τάδε πάσχει τὰ μείζω ) , διὰ δὲ αὐτὰ τὰς Συρακούσας κακωθῆναι μὲν ἵνα σωφρονισθῶμεν βούλεται , περιγενέσθαι δὲ ἕνεκα τῆς αὑτοῦ ἀσφαλείας , οὐκ ἀνθρωπίνης δυνάμεως βούλησιν ἐλπίζει ·
If, moreover, any one envies us, or is afraid of us, (for to both these feelings are more powerful states exposed,) and for this reason wishes Syracuse to be brought down, that we may be taught moderation, but yet for his own safety's sake would have it escape destruction, he indulges a wish beyond the limit of human power.


6.78.2
4547
οὐ γὰρ οἷόν τε ἅμα τῆς τε ἐπιθυμίας καὶ τῆς τύχης τὸν αὐτὸν ὁμοίως ταμίαν γενέσθαι .
For it is not possible for the same man to be alike the arbiter of his own desire and of fortune.


6.78.3
4548
καὶ εἰ γνώμῃ ἁμάρτοι , τοῖς αὑτοῦ κακοῖς ὀλοφυρθεὶς τάχ’ ἂν ἴσως καὶ τοῖς ἐμοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ποτὲ βουληθείη αὖθις φθονῆσαι .
And should he fail in views, then, while lamenting his own misfortunes, he might, perhaps, some time or other, wish again to envy our advantages.


6.78.3
4549
ἀδύνατον δὲ προεμένῳ καὶ μὴ τοὺς αὐτοὺς κινδύνους οὐ περὶ τῶν ὀνομάτων , ἀλλὰ περὶ τῶν ἔργων , ἐθελήσαντι προσλαβεῖν ·
But that will be impossible if he abandon us, and will not take his part in the same perils; which are incurred, not for names, but for realities;


6.78.3
4550
λόγῳ μὲν γὰρ τὴν ἡμετέραν δύναμιν σῴζοι ἄν τις , ἔργῳ δὲ τὴν αὑτοῦ σωτηρίαν .
for though nominally he would preserve our power, he would really secure his own safety.


6.78.4
4551
καὶ μάλιστα εἰκὸς ἦν ὑμᾶς , ὦ Καμαριναῖοι , ὁμόρους ὄντας καὶ τὰ δεύτερα κινδυνεύσοντας προορᾶσθαι αὐτὰ καὶ μὴ μαλακῶς ὥσπερ νῦν ξυμμαχεῖν , αὐτοὺς δὲ πρὸς ἡμᾶς μᾶλλον ἰόντας , ἅπερ ἂν εἰ ἐς τὴν Καμαριναίαν πρῶτον ἀφίκοντο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι δεόμενοι ἂν ἐπεκαλεῖσθε , ταῦτα ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου καὶ νῦν παρακελευομένους ὅπως μηδὲν ἐνδώσομεν φαίνεσθαι .
And it was reasonable that you especially, Camarinaeans, who live on our borders, and are the next to incur the danger, should have provided for this, and not have joined us remissly, as you are now doing;


6.78.4
4552
ἀλλ’ οὔθ’ ὑμεῖς νῦν γέ πω οὔθ’ οἱ ἄλλοι ἐπὶ ταῦτα ὥρμησθε .
But neither have ye, hitherto, nor the rest, bestirred yourselves for these objects.


6.79.1
4553
&quot; Δειλίᾳ δὲ ἴσως τὸ δίκαιον πρός τε ἡμᾶς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἐπιόντας θεραπεύσετε , λέγοντες ξυμμαχίαν εἶναι ὑμῖν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ·
But through cowardice, perhaps, you will study what is just, both towards us and towards the invaders, and allege that there is an alliance between you and the Athenians.


6.79.1
4554
ἥν γε οὐκ ἐπὶ τοῖς φίλοις ἐποιήσασθε , τῶν δὲ ἐχθρῶν ἤν τις ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἴῃ , καὶ τοῖς γε Ἀθηναίοις βοηθεῖν , ὅταν ὑπ’ ἄλλων καὶ μὴ αὐτοὶ ὥσπερ νῦν τοὺς πέλας ἀδικῶσιν , ἐπεὶ οὐδ’ οἱ Ῥηγῖνοι ὄντες Χαλκιδῆς Χαλκιδέας ὄντας Λεοντίνους ἐθέλουσι ξυγκατοικίζειν .
Yes, but you did not conclude that to the injury of your friends, but in case any of your enemies might attack you; and to assist the Athenians, surely, when they were wronged by others, and not when they were themselves wronging their neighbours, as they are now. For not even do the Rhegians, although of Chalcidian extraction, consent to join in the reinstatement of the Chalcidian Leontines.


6.79.2
4555
καὶ δεινὸν εἰ ἐκεῖνοι μὲν τὸ ἔργον τοῦ καλοῦ δικαιώματος ὑποπτεύοντες ἀλόγως σωφρονοῦσιν , ὑμεῖς δ’ εὐλόγῳ προφάσει τοὺς μὲν φύσει πολεμίους βούλεσθε ὠφελεῖν , τοὺς δὲ ἔτι μᾶλλον φύσει ξυγγενεῖς μετὰ τῶν ἐχθίστων διαφθεῖραι .
And it is a strange thing if they, suspecting the real meaning of this fine pretence, are wise without any reason to offer for their conduct, while you, with a reasonable plea to urge, choose to assist your natural enemies, and, in concert with your bitterest foes, to ruin men who are still more your natural connexions.


6.79.3
4556
ἀλλ’ οὐ δίκαιον , ἀμύνειν δὲ καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθαι τὴν παρασκευὴν αὐτῶν ·
Nay, that is not just; but rather, to assist us, and not to be afraid of their armament.


6.79.3
4557
οὐ γὰρ ἢν ἡμεῖς ξυστῶμεν πάντες δεινή ἐστιν , ἀλλ’ ἤν , ὅπερ οὗτοι σπεύδουσι , τ- ἐναντία διαστῶμεν , ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ πρὸς ἡμᾶς μόνους ἐλθόντες καὶ μάχῃ περιγενόμενοι ἔπραξαν ἃ ἐβούλοντο , ἀπῆλθον δὲ διὰ τάχους .
For it is not formidable, if we all take our stand together; but only if, on the contrary, we are separated from each other, which they are so anxious to effect: since even when they came against us alone, and were victorious in battle, they did not achieve what they wished, but quickly went away again.


6.80.1
4558
ὥστε οὐχ ἁθρόους γε ὄντας εἰκὸς ἀθυμεῖν , ἰέναι δὲ ἐς τὴν ξυμμαχίαν προθυμότερον , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου παρεσομένης ὠφελίας , οἳ τῶνδε κρείσσους εἰσὶ τὸ παράπαν τὰ πολέμια ·
Surely then, if we were united, it were not reasonable for us to be disheartened: but we ought to enter more heartily into alliance, especially as succours will join us from the Peloponnese also, the inhabitants of which are altogether superior to these men in military matters.


6.80.1
4559
καὶ μὴ ἐκείνην τὴν προμηθίαν δοκεῖν τῳ ἡμῖν μὲν ἴσην εἶναι , ὑμῖν δὲ ἀσφαλῆ , τὸ μηδετέροις δὴ ὡς καὶ ἀμφοτέρων ὄντας ξυμμάχους βοηθεῖν .
And no one should think that forethought of yours to be  to  while it is  for  I mean your assisting neither party, as being allies of both.


6.80.2
4560
οὐ γὰρ ἔργῳ ἴσον ὥσπερ τῷ δικαιώματί ἐστιν .
For it is not fair in fact, as it is in profession.


6.80.2
4561
εἰ γὰρ δι’ ὑμᾶς μὴ ξυμμαχήσαντας ὅ τε παθὼν σφαλήσεται καὶ ὁ κρατῶν περιέσται , τί ἄλλο ἢ τῇ αὐτῇ ἀπουσίᾳ τοῖς μὲν οὐκ ἠμύνατε σωθῆναι , τοὺς δὲ οὐκ ἐκωλύσατε κακοὺς γενέσθαι ;
For if it be through your not siding with us that both the sufferer is defeated and the conqueror gains the victory, what else do ye but refuse, by the self-same standing aloof, to aid the one party for their preservation, and to prevent the other from behaving basely?


6.80.2
4562
καίτοι κάλλιον τοῖς ἀδικουμένοις καὶ ἅμα ξυγγενέσι προσθεμένους τήν τε κοινὴν ὠφελίαν τῇ Σικελίᾳ φυλάξαι καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους φίλους δὴ ὄντας μὴ ἐᾶσαι ἁμαρτεῖν .
And yet it were honourable for you, by joining those who are injured, and at the same time your own kinsmen, to guard the common interest of Sicily, and not to permit the Athenians, your friends forsooth, to do wrong.


6.80.3
4563
&quot; ξυνελόντες τε λέγομεν οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐκδιδάσκειν μὲν οὐδὲν ἔργον εἶναι σαφῶς οὔτε ὑμᾶς οὔτε τοὺς ἄλλους περὶ ὧν αὐτοὶ οὐδὲν χεῖρον γιγνώσκετε ·
In short, we Syracusans say, that it is of no use to afford certain information, either to you or to the rest, about what you know yourselves, as well as we;


6.80.3
4564
δεόμεθα δὲ καὶ μαρτυρόμεθα ἅμα , εἰ μὴ πείσομεν , ὅτι ἐπιβουλευόμεθα μὲν ὑπὸ Ἰώνων αἰεὶ πολεμίων , προδιδόμεθα δὲ ὑπὸ ὑμῶν Δωριῆς Δωριῶν .
but we entreat you, and at the same time protest, if we do not prevail on you, that we are plotted against by Ionians, who are always our enemies, while we are betrayed by you, Dorians by Dorians.


6.80.4
4565
καὶ εἰ καταστρέψονται ἡμᾶς Ἀθηναῖοι , ταῖς μὲν ὑμετέραις γνώμαις κρατήσουσι , τῷ δ’ αὑτῶν ὀνόματι τιμηθήσονται , καὶ τῆς νίκης οὐκ ἄλλον τινὰ ἆθλον ἢ τὸν τὴν νίκην παρασχόντα λήψονται ·
And if the Athenians reduce us to subjection, though it is by your decisions that they will gain the victory, it is in their own name that they will enjoy the honour;


6.80.4
4566
καὶ εἰ αὖ ἡμεῖς περιεσόμεθα , τῆς αἰτίας τῶν κινδύνων οἱ αὐτοὶ τὴν τιμωρίαν ὑφέξετε .
and they will receive no other prize for the victory than those men who put the victory into their hands. If, on the other hand, we are the conquerors, you will also have to submit to the punishment due to the authors of our dangers.


6.80.5
4567
σκοπεῖτε οὖν καὶ αἱρεῖσθε ἤδη ἢ τὴν αὐτίκα ἀκινδύνως δουλείαν ἢ κἂν περιγενόμενοι μεθ’ ἡμῶν τούσδε τε μὴ αἰσχρῶς δεσπότας λαβεῖν καὶ τὴν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἔχθραν μὴ ἂν βραχεῖαν γενομένην διαφυγεῖν &quot; .
" Consider then, and choose at once, either immediate slavery without any peril, or the chance of gaining the victory with us, and so avoiding a disgraceful submission to these men as your masters, as also of escaping our enmity, which would be of no trivial kind."


6.81.1
4568
τοιαῦτα μὲν ὁ Ἑρμοκράτης εἶπεν .
Hermocrates spoke to this effect;


6.81.1
4569
ὁ δ’ Εὔφημος ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων πρεσβευτὴς μετ’ αὐτὸν τοιάδε .
and after him, Euphemus, the Athenian ambassador, as follows:


6.82.1
4570
&quot; ἀφικόμεθα μὲν ἐπὶ τῆς πρότερον οὔσης ξυμμαχίας ἀνανεώσει , τοῦ δὲ Συρακοσίου καθαψαμένου ἀνάγκη καὶ περὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς εἰπεῖν ὡς εἰκότως ἔχομεν .
"Though we are come hither for the purpose of renewing our former alliance, yet, as the Syracusan orator has attacked us on that head, we must also address you on the subject of our empire, to show that we enjoy it on just grounds.


6.82.2
4571
τὸ μὲν οὖν μέγιστον μαρτύριον αὐτὸς εἶπεν , ὅτι οἱ Ἴωνες αἰεί ποτε πολέμιοι τοῖς Δωριεῦσιν εἰσίν .
The strongest proof, then, of this he himself has mentioned, in his assertion that the Ionians have ever been hostile to the Dorians.


6.82.2
4572
ἔχει δὲ καὶ οὕτως ·
And such too is the case.


6.82.2
4573
ἡμεῖς γὰρ Ἴωνες ὄντες Πελοποννησίοις Δωριεῦσι καὶ πλέοσιν οὖσι καὶ παροικοῦσιν ἐσκεψάμεθα ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἥκιστα αὐτῶν ὑπακουσόμεθα , καὶ μετὰ τὰ Μηδικὰ ναῦς κτησάμενοι τῆς μὲν Λακεδαιμονίων ἀρχῆς καὶ ἡγεμονίας ἀπηλλάγημεν ,οὐδὲν προσῆκον μᾶλλόν τι ἐκείνους ἡμῖν ἢ καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐκείνοις ἐπιτάσσειν , πλὴν καθ’ ὅσον ἐν τῷ παρόντι μεῖζον ἴσχυον , αὐτοὶ δὲ τῶν ὑπὸ βασιλεῖ πρότερον ὄντων ἡγεμόνες καταστάντες οἰκοῦμεν , νομίσαντες ἥκιστ’ ἂν ὑπὸ Πελοποννησίοις οὕτως εἶναι , δύναμιν ἔχοντες ᾗ ἀμυνούμεθα , καὶ ἐς τὸ ἀκριβὲς εἰπεῖν οὐδὲ ἀδίκως καταστρεψάμενοι τούς τε Ἴωνας καὶ νησιώτας , οὓς ξυγγενεῖς φασὶν ὄντας ἡμᾶς Συρακόσιοι δεδουλῶσθαι .
For we, who are Ionians, considered, with regard to the Peloponnesians, who are Dorians, and more numerous than ourselves, and living near us, in what way we might be least subject to them.


6.82.4
4574
ἦλθον γὰρ ἐπὶ τὴν μητρόπολιν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς μετὰ τοῦ Μήδου καὶ οὐκ ἐτόλμησαν ἀποστάντες τὰ οἰκεῖα φθεῖραι , ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς ἐκλιπόντες τὴν πόλιν , δουλείαν δὲ αὐτοί τε ἐβούλοντο καὶ ἡμῖν τὸ αὐτὸ ἐπενεγκεῖν .
For they came against their mother-country, against us, I mean, in company with the Mede; and could not bring themselves to revolt from him, and to sacrifice their property-as  did, when we evacuated our city-but chose slavery themselves, and to bring the same on us also.


6.83.1
4575
ἀνθ’ ὧν ἄξιοί τε ὄντες ἅμα ἄρχομεν , ὅτι τε ναυτικὸν πλεῖστόν τε καὶ προθυμίαν ἀπροφάσιστον παρεσχόμεθα ἐς τοὺς Ἕλληνας , καὶ διότι καὶ τῷ Μήδῳ ἑτοίμως τοῦτο δρῶντες οὗτοι ἡμᾶς ἔβλαπτον , ἅμα δὲ τῆς πρὸς Πελοποννησίους ἰσχύος ὀρεγόμενοι .
"Wherefore we are worthy of the empire we enjoy, because we supplied the most numerous fleet, and showed uncompromising zeal in behalf of the Greeks; and because these men, by so readily acting as they did, even in favour of the Mede, inflicted injury on us; while at the same time we aim at gaining strength against the Peloponnesians.


6.83.2
4576
καὶ οὐ καλλιεπούμεθα ὡς ἢ τὸν βάρβαρον μόνοι καθελόντες εἰκότως ἄρχομεν ἢ ἐπ’ ἐλευθερίᾳ τῇ τῶνδε μᾶλλον ἢ τῶν ξυμπάντων τε καὶ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ αὐτῶν κινδυνεύσαντες .
And we make no fine professions of justly enjoying dominion, either as having by ourselves overthrown the barbarian, or as having faced danger for the liberty of these men, more than for that of all, and of ourselves at the same time.


6.83.2
4577
πᾶσι δὲ ἀνεπίφθονον τὴν προσήκουσαν σωτηρίαν ἐκπορίζεσθαι .
For in no one is it an invidious thing to provide for his own safety.


6.83.2
4578
καὶ νῦν τῆς ἡμετέρας ἀσφαλείας ἕνεκα καὶ ἐνθάδε παρόντες ὁρῶμεν καὶ ὑμῖν τ- αὐτὰ ξυμφέροντα .
And now, having come hither also for the sake of our own security, we see that these same things are expedient for you likewise.


6.83.3
4579
ἀποφαίνομεν δὲ ἐξ ὧν οἵδε τε διαβάλλουσι καὶ ὑμεῖς μάλιστα ἐπὶ τὸ φοβερώτερον ὑπονοεῖτε , εἰδότες τοὺς περιδεῶς ὑποπτεύοντάς τι λόγου μὲν ἡδονῇ τὸ παραυτίκα τερπομένους , τῇ δ’ ἐγχειρήσει ὕστερον τὰ ξυμφέροντα πράσσοντας .
And we prove it from what these men state to our prejudice, and what you, in your too great alarm, suspect; knowing that those who through fear are suspicious, though pleased at the moment by the charms of oratory, yet afterwards attend to their real interests in what they undertake.


6.83.4
4580
τήν τε γὰρ ἐκεῖ ἀρχὴν εἰρήκαμεν διὰ δέος ἔχειν καὶ τὰ ἐνθάδε διὰ τὸ αὐτὸ ἥκειν μετὰ τῶν φίλων ἀσφαλῶς καταστησόμενοι , καὶ οὐ δουλωσόμενοι , μὴ παθεῖν δὲ μᾶλλον τοῦτο κωλύσοντες .
For we have said that we hold our dominion there under the influence of fear, and that for the same reason we are come to put the states here on a safe footing, in concert with our friends; and not to enslave them, but rather to prevent their being so treated.


6.84.1
4581
&quot; ὑπολάβῃ δὲ μηδεὶς ὡς οὐδὲν προσῆκον ὑμῶν κηδόμεθα , γνοὺς ὅτι σῳζομένων ὑμῶν καὶ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀσθενεῖς ὑμᾶς ὄντας ἀντέχειν Συρακοσίοις ἧσσον ἂν τούτων πεμψάντων τινὰ δύναμιν Πελοποννησίοις ἡμεῖς βλαπτοίμεθα .
"And let no one suppose that we are interesting ourselves in you without any connexion existing between us; since he must know that through your being preserved, and resisting the Syracusans, (being not too weak to do so,) we should be less readily hurt by their sending a force to the Peloponnesians.


6.84.2
4582
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ προσήκετε ἤδη ἡμῖν τὰ μέγιστα .
In this way, then, you are connected with us in the greatest degree;


6.84.2
4583
διόπερ καὶ τοὺς Λεοντίνους εὔλογον κατοικίζειν μὴ ὑπηκόους ὥσπερ τοὺς ξυγγενεῖς αὐτῶν τοὺς ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ , ἀλλ’ ὡς δυνατωτάτους , ἵνα ἐκ τῆς σφετέρας ὅμοροι ὄντες τοῖσδε ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν λυπηροὶ ὦσιν .
and on this account too it is reasonable that we should reinstate the Leontines, not as subjects, like their kinsmen in Euboea, but in as powerful a condition as possible; that from their own country, living as they do close to these men's borders, they may in our behalf be annoying to them.


6.84.3
4584
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἐκεῖ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀρκοῦμεν πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους , καὶ ὁ Χαλκιδεύς , ὃν ἀλόγως ἡμᾶς φησὶ δουλωσαμένους τοὺς ἐνθάδε ἐλευθεροῦν , ξύμφορος ἡμῖν ἀπαράσκευος ὢν καὶ χρήματα μόνον φέρων , τὰ δὲ ἐνθάδε καὶ Λεοντῖνοι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι φίλοι ὅτι μάλιστα αὐτονομούμενοι .
For in Greece we are by ourselves able to cope with our enemies; and the Chalcidians, after whose subjugation the orator says that we are inconsistently giving liberty to those here, are advantageous to us by being without any armament, and only paying us money; but the people here, both the Leontines and our other friends, by being left as independent as possible.


6.85.1
4585
ἀνδρὶ δὲ τυράννῳ ἢ πόλει ἀρχὴν ἐχούσῃ οὐδὲν ἄλογον ὅτι ξυμφέρον οὐδ’ οἰκεῖον ὅτι μὴ πιστόν ·
"To an individual, however, who has absolute power, or to a state that holds dominion, nothing is inconsistent that is profitable, nothing reckoned as kindred that does not command confidence;


6.85.1
4586
πρὸς ἕκαστα δὲ δεῖ ἢ ἐχθρὸν ἢ φίλον μετὰ καιροῦ γίγνεσθαι .
but in every case, as opportunity may serve, you must become either a foe or a friend.


6.85.1
4587
καὶ ἡμᾶς τοῦτο ὠφελεῖ ἐνθάδε , οὐκ ἢν τοὺς φίλους κακώσωμεν , ἀλλ’ ἢν οἱ ἐχθροὶ διὰ τὴν τῶν φίλων ῥώμην ἀδύνατοι ὦσιν .
And in our case, our advantage here consists in this,—not that we should reduce our friends to weakness, but that, owing to the strength of our friends, our foes should be powerless. Nor ought you to doubt this.


6.85.2
4588
ἀπιστεῖν δὲ οὐ χρή ·
For even in the case of our allies in those parts, as they are severally useful to us, so we govern them;


6.85.2
4589
καὶ γὰρ τοὺς ἐκεῖ ξυμμάχους ὡς ἕκαστοι χρήσιμοι ἐξηγούμεθα , Χίους μὲν καὶ Μηθυμναίους νεῶν παροκωχῇ αὐτονόμους , τοὺς δὲ πολλοὺς χρημάτων βιαιότερον φορᾷ , ἄλλους δὲ καὶ πάνυ ἐλευθέρως ξυμμαχοῦντας , καίπερ νησιώτας ὄντας καὶ εὐλήπτους , διότι ἐν χωρίοις ἐπικαίροις εἰσὶ περὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον .
the Chians and Methymnaeans as independent, on condition of their supplying ships; the greater part of them on more stringent terms, subject to contribution of money; but others, although they are islanders and easy to reduce, as allies on terms of entire freedom, because they lie in favourable positions around the Peloponnese.


6.85.3
4590
ὥστε καὶ τ- ἐνθάδε εἰκὸς πρὸς τὸ λυσιτελοῦν , καὶ ὃ λέγομεν , ἐς Συρακοσίους δέος καθίστασθαι .
So that here also it is natural that we should regulate them with an eye to our advantage, and, as we say, with reference to our fear of the Syracusans.


6.85.3
4591
ἀρχῆς γὰρ ἐφίενται ὑμῶν καὶ βούλονται ἐπὶ τῷ ἡμετέρῳ ξυστήσαντες ὑμᾶς ὑπόπτῳ , βίᾳ ἢ καὶ κατ’ ἐρημίαν , ἀπράκτων ἡμῶν ἀπελθόντων , αὐτοὶ ἄρξαι τῆς Σικελίας .
For they are aiming at dominion over you, and wish, after uniting you on the strength of your suspicions of us, themselves to sway the empire of Sicily, by force, or through your forlorn condition, when we have departed without gaining our object.


6.85.3
4592
ἀνάγκη δέ , ἢν ξυστῆτε πρὸς αὐτούς ·
And it must be so, if you unite with them;


6.85.3
4593
οὔτε γὰρ ἡμῖν ἔτι ἔσται ἰσχὺς τοσαύτη ἐς ἓν ξυστᾶσα εὐμεταχείριστος , οὔθ’ οἵδ’ ἀσθενεῖς ἂν ἡμῶν μὴ παρόντων πρὸς ὑμᾶς εἶεν .
for neither will so great a force, when united, be any longer easy for us to manage, nor would these men want strength to deal with you, when we were not here.


6.86.1
4594
καὶ ὅτῳ ταῦτα μὴ δοκεῖ , αὐτὸ τὸ ἔργον ἐλέγχει .
"And whoever does not think this to be the case, the very fact itself convicts him of being wrong.


6.86.1
4595
τὸ γὰρ πρότερον ἡμᾶς ἐπηγάγεσθε οὐκ ἄλλον τινὰ προσείοντες φόβον ἤ , εἰ περιοψόμεθα ὑμᾶς ὑπὸ Συρακοσίοις γενέσθαι , ὅτι καὶ αὐτοὶ κινδυνεύσομεν .
For on a former occasion you called us to your aid by holding out to us no other fear, than that, if we permitted you to fall under the Syracusans, we ourselves also should be exposed to danger.


6.86.2
4596
καὶ νῦν οὐ δίκαιον , ᾧπερ καὶ ἡμᾶς ἠξιοῦτε λόγῳ πείθειν , τῷ αὐτῷ ἀπιστεῖν , οὐδ’ ὅτι δυνάμει μείζονι πρὸς τὴν τῶνδε ἰσχὺν πάρεσμεν ὑποπτεύεσθαι , πολὺ δὲ μᾶλλον τοῖσδε ἀπιστεῖν .
It is not right therefore now, that you should refuse to be persuaded by that self-same argument by which you wished to persuade  or that, because we are come with a larger armament, you should be suspicious of us; but much rather, that you should mistrust these men.


6.86.3
4597
ἡμεῖς μέν γε οὔτε ἐμμεῖναι δυνατοὶ μὴ μεθ’ ὑμῶν , εἴ τε καὶ γενόμενοι κακοὶ κατεργασαίμεθα , ἀδύνατοι κατασχεῖν διὰ μῆκός τε πλοῦ καὶ ἀπορίᾳ φυλακῆς πόλεων μεγάλων καὶ τῇ παρασκευῇ ἠπειρωτίδων ·
We, at least, have no power to remain amongst you without your support; and even if we should show ourselves base, and bring you into subjection, we should be unable to keep you under our dominion, both on account of the length of the voyage, and the difficulty of keeping guard over cities so great in extent, and of an inland character, as regards their resources.


6.86.3
4598
οἵδε δὲ οὐ στρατοπέδῳ , πόλει δὲ μείζονι τῆς ἡμετέρας παρουσίας ἐποικοῦντες ὑμῖν αἰεί τε ἐπιβουλεύουσι καὶ ὅταν καιρὸν λάβωσιν ἑκάστου , οὐκ ἀνιᾶσιν ( ἔδειξαν δὲ καὶ ἄλλα ἤδη καὶ τὰ ἐς Λεοντίνους ) , καὶ νῦν τολμῶσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ταῦτα κωλύοντας καὶ ἀνέχοντας τὴν Σικελίαν μέχρι τοῦδε μὴ ὑπ’ αὐτοὺς εἶναι παρακαλεῖν ὑμᾶς ὡς ἀναισθήτους .
These men, on the other hand, living near you as they do, not in a camp, but in a city far stronger than our force here present, are constantly plotting against you;


6.86.5
4599
πολὺ δὲ ἐπὶ ἀληθεστέραν γε σωτηρίαν ἡμεῖς ἀντιπαρακαλοῦμεν , δεόμενοι τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων ἀμφοτέροις μὴ προδιδόναι , νομίσαι δὲ τοῖσδε μὲν καὶ ἄνευ ξυμμάχων αἰεὶ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἑτοίμην διὰ τὸ πλῆθος εἶναι ὁδόν , ὑμῖν δ’ οὐ πολλάκις παρασχήσειν μετὰ τοσῆσδε ἐπικουρίας ἀμύνασθαι ·
But we, in opposition to them, urge you to a far more real safety, begging you not to betray that which is secured to both of us by each other; and to consider, that while for them, even without any allies, the way to you is always open, you will not often have a chance of defending yourselves in conjunction with so large a force of auxiliaries;

ἣν εἰ τῷ ὑπόπτῳ ἢ ἄπρακτον ἐάσετε ἀπελθεῖν ἢ καὶ σφαλεῖσαν , ἔτι βουλήσεσθε καὶ πολλοστὸν μόριον αὐτῆς ἰδεῖν , ὅτε οὐδὲν ἔτι περανεῖ παραγενόμενον ὑμῖν .
of which, if through your suspicions you allow it to depart, either unsuccessful, or, perhaps, even defeated, you will wish yet to see even a very small portion, when its presence will no longer accomplish anything for you.


6.87.1
4601
&quot; ἀλλὰ μήτε ὑμεῖς , ὦ Καμαριναῖοι , ταῖς τῶνδε διαβολαῖς ἀναπείθεσθε μήτε οἱ ἄλλοι ·
"But neither do ye, Camarinaeans, nor the rest, be persuaded by these men's calumnies.


6.87.1
4602
εἰρήκαμεν δ’ ὑμῖν πᾶσαν τὴν ἀλήθειαν περὶ ὧν ὑποπτευόμεθα , καὶ ἔτι ἐν κεφαλαίοις ὑπομνήσαντες ἀξιώσομεν πείθειν .
For we have told you the whole truth concerning these things about which we are suspected, and will still remind you briefly of them, and so try to persuade you."


6.87.2
4603
φαμὲν γὰρ ἄρχειν μὲν τῶν ἐκεῖ , ἵνα μὴ ὑπακούωμεν ἄλλου , ἐλευθεροῦν δὲ τὰ ἐνθάδε , ὅπως μὴ ὑπ’ αὐτῶν βλαπτώμεθα , πολλὰ δ’ ἀναγκάζεσθαι πράσσειν , διότι καὶ πολλὰ φυλασσόμεθα , ξύμμαχοι δὲ καὶ νῦν καὶ πρότερον τοῖς ἐνθάδε ὑμῶν ἀδικουμένοις οὐκ ἄκλητοι , παρακληθέντες δὲ ἥκειν .
" We say then, that we exercise dominion over the men in those parts to avoid being subject to another; but that we liberate those who are here, to avoid being hurt by them; that we are compelled to meddle with many things, because we have also many things to guard against; and that we came, both now and before, as allies to those of you here who were being injured, not without being invited, but after receiving an invitation."


6.87.3
4604
καὶ ὑμεῖς μήθ’ ὡς δικασταὶ γενόμενοι τῶν ἡμῖν ποιουμένων μήθ’ ὡς σωφρονισταί , ὃ χαλεπὸν ἤδη , ἀποτρέπειν πειρᾶσθε , καθ’ ὅσον δέ τι ὑμῖν τῆς ἡμετέρας πολυπραγμοσύνης καὶ τρόπου τὸ αὐτὸ ξυμφέρει , τούτῳ ἀπολαβόντες χρήσασθε , καὶ νομίσατε μὴ πάντας ἐν ἴσῳ βλάπτειν αὐτά , πολὺ δὲ πλείους τῶν Ἑλλήνων καὶ ὠφελεῖν ·
" And do not ye, either as judges of what is done by us, or as moderators, attempt to divert us, [which would now be difficult,) but so far as any thing in our meddling policy and disposition is at the same time profitable for  that take, and make the most of it. And believe that it is not equally injurious to all, but that to a large majority of the Greeks it is even beneficial."


6.87.4
4605
ἐν παντὶ γὰρ πᾶς χωρίῳ , καὶ ᾧ μὴ ὑπάρχομεν , ὅ τε οἰόμενος ἀδικήσεσθαι καὶ ὁ ἐπιβουλεύων διὰ τὸ ἑτοίμην ὑπεῖναι ἐλπίδα τῷ μὲν ἀντιτυχεῖν ἐπικουρίας ἀφ’ ἡμῶν , τῷ δὲ εἰ ἥξομεν , μὴ ἀδεεῖ εἶναι κινδυνεύειν , ἀμφότεροι ἀναγκάζονται ὁ μὲν ἄκων σωφρονεῖν , ὁ δ’ ἀπραγμόνως σῴζεσθαι .
" For every one in every place, even where we are not already present, both he who thinks that he will suffer wrong, and he who is meditating to commit it, through having a prospect ever close at hand, the one, of obtaining help from us against his injurer, the other, that if we come, they run a risk of not being free from alarm, both, I say, are alike compelled, the one, to be moderate against his own will, the other, to be saved without his own exertion."


6.87.5
4606
ταύτην οὖν τὴν κοινὴν τῷ τε δεομένῳ καὶ ὑμῖν νῦν παροῦσαν ἀσφάλειαν μὴ ἀπώσησθε , ἀλλ’ ἐξισώσαντες τοῖς ἄλλοις μεθ’ ἡμῶν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις , ἀντὶ τοῦ αἰεὶ φυλάσσεσθαι αὐτούς , καὶ ἀντεπιβουλεῦσαί ποτε ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου μεταλάβετε &quot; .
" This security, then, which is common to all who require it, and which is now presented to you, do not ye reject; but, acting like others, instead of constantly guarding against the Syracusans, now unite with us, and take at length your equal share in plotting against them."


6.88.1
4607
τοιαῦτα δὲ ὁ Εὔφημος εἶπεν .
To this effect spoke Euphemus.


6.88.1
4608
οἱ δὲ Καμαριναῖοι ἐπεπόνθεσαν τοιόνδε .
Now the Camarinaeans had felt on the subject as follows:


6.88.1
4609
τοῖς μὲν Ἀθηναίοις εὖνοι ἦσαν , πλὴν καθ’ ὅσον εἰ τὴν Σικελίαν ᾤοντο αὐτοὺς δουλώσεσθαι , τοῖς δὲ Συρακοσίοις αἰεὶ κατὰ τὸ ὅμορον διάφοροι ·
Towards the Athenians they were well inclined, except so far as they might think that they would subjugate Sicily, but with the Syracusans they had always, in the spirit of borderers, been at variance.


6.88.1
4610
δεδιότες δ’ οὐχ ἧσσον τοὺς Συρακοσίους ἐγγὺς ὄντας μὴ καὶ ἄνευ σφῶν περιγένωνται , τό τε πρῶτον αὐτοῖς τοὺς ὀλίγους ἱππέας ἔπεμψαν καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ἐδόκει αὐτοῖς ὑπουργεῖν μὲν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις μᾶλλον ἔργῳ , ὡς ἂν δύνωνται μετριώτατα , ἐν δὲ τῷ παρόντι , ἵνα μηδὲ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἔλασσον δοκῶσι νεῖμαι , ἐπειδὴ καὶ ἐπικρατέστεροι τῇ μάχῃ ἐγένοντο , λόγῳ ἀποκρίνασθαι ἴσα ἀμφοτέροις .
Being, however, more afraid of the Syracusans, who were close at hand, lest they might, even without their assistance, gain the ascendency, they both sent them in the first instance that small body of horse, and determined for the future to do more actual service for the Syracusans, (though as sparingly as possible;) but for the present, that they might not seem to show less respect for the Athenians—since they had even proved the stronger in the battle—they resolved to give a verbal answer that should be fair to both parties.


6.88.2
4611
καὶ οὕτω βουλευσάμενοι ἀπεκρίναντο , ἐπειδὴ τυγχάνει ἀμφοτέροις οὖσι ξυμμάχοις σφῶν πρὸς ἀλλήλους πόλεμος ὤν , εὔορκον δοκεῖν εἶναι σφίσιν ἐν τῷ παρόντι μηδετέροις ἀμύνειν .
Having, therefore, adopted this counsel, they answered, "That since mutual hostilities were being carried on by parties who were both in alliance with them, they thought it to be most consistent with their oaths to aid neither party for the present."


6.88.2
4612
καὶ οἱ πρέσβεις ἑκατέρων ἀπῆλθον .
And the ambassadors from each party departed.


6.88.3
4613
καὶ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι τὰ καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς ἐξηρτύοντο ἐς τὸν πόλεμον , οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν τῇ Νάξῳ ἐστρατοπεδευμένοι τὰ πρὸς τοὺς Σικελοὺς ἔπρασσον ὅπως αὐτοῖς ὡς πλεῖστοι προσχωρήσονται .
And so the ambassadors on each side returned. The Syracusans were now preparing their forces for war, while the Athenians encamped at Naxos were negotiating with the Sicels, to get as many as possible to join


6.88.4
4614
καὶ οἱ μὲν πρὸς τὰ πεδία μᾶλλον τῶν Σικελῶν ὑπήκοοι ὄντες τῶν Συρακοσίων οἱ πολλοὶ ἀφειστήκεσαν ·
Now such of the Sicels as lived more on the plains, and who were subject to the Syracusans, in most cases stood aloof from them;


6.88.4
4615
τῶν δὲ τὴν μεσόγειαν ἐχόντων αὐτόνομοι οὖσαι καὶ πρότερον αἰεὶ αἱ οἰκήσεις εὐθὺς πλὴν ὀλίγοι μετὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἦσαν , καὶ σῖτόν τε κατεκόμιζον τῷ στρατεύματι καὶ εἰσὶν οἳ καὶ χρήματα .
but those who occupied the interior, their homes having before this always been independent, immediately, with a very few exceptions, sided with the Athenians, and carried down corn for the army, and in some cases money.


6.88.5
4616
ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς μὴ προσχωροῦντας οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι στρατεύοντες τοὺς μὲν προσηνάγκαζον , τοὺς δὲ καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων φρουρούς τε πεμπόντων καὶ βοηθούντων ἀπεκωλύοντο .
Against those who did not come over to them the Athenians made an expedition, and compelled some, but were prevented from compelling others by the Syracusans' sending them garrisons, and coming to their aid.


6.88.5
4617
τόν τε χειμῶνα μεθορμισάμενοι ἐκ τῆς Νάξου ἐς τὴν Κατάνην καὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ὃ κατεκαύθη ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων αὖθις ἀνορθώσαντες διεχείμαζον .
Having moved their station for the winter from Naxos to Catana, and having raised again the camp which had been burned down by the Syracusans, they remained there the rest of that season.


6.88.6
4618
καὶ ἔπεμψαν μὲν ἐς Καρχηδόνα τριήρη περὶ φιλίας , εἰ δύναιντό τι ὠφελεῖσθαι , ἔπεμψαν δὲ καὶ ἐς Τυρσηνίαν , ἔστιν ὧν πόλεων ἐπαγγελλομένων καὶ αὐτῶν ξυμπολεμεῖν .
They sent at this time a trireme to Carthage with proposals of friendship, on the chance of their obtaining any help, and another to Tyrrhenia, as some of its cities had of their own accord offered to join them in the war.


6.88.6
4619
περιήγγελλον δὲ καὶ τοῖς Σικελοῖς καὶ ἐς τὴν Ἔγεσταν πέμψαντες ἐκέλευον ἵππους σφίσιν ὡς πλείστους πέμπειν , καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐς τὸν περιτειχισμόν , πλινθία καὶ σίδηρον , ἡτοίμαζον , καὶ ὅσα ἔδει , ὡς ἅμα τῷ ἦρι ἑξόμενοι τοῦ πολέμου .
They also despatched messengers about to the Sicels, and likewise to Segesta, desiring that they would forward to them as many horses as


6.88.7
4620
οἱ δ’ ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον καὶ Λακεδαίμονα τῶν Συρακοσίων ἀποσταλέντες πρέσβεις τούς τε Ἰταλιώτας ἅμα παραπλέοντες ἐπειρῶντο πείθειν μὴ περιορᾶν τὰ γιγνόμενα ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὡς καὶ ἐκείνοις ὁμοίως ἐπιβουλευόμενα , καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐν τῇ Κορίνθῳ ἐγένοντο , λόγους ἐποιοῦντο ἀξιοῦντες σφίσι κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς βοηθεῖν .
possible; while they also prepared for the circumvallation bricks, iron, and all other requisites, intending to commence hostilities in the spring. The Syracusan ambassadors, on the other hand, who had been despatched to Corinth and Lacedaemon, both endeavoured, as they coasted along, to persuade the Greeks of Italy not to look with in difference on the proceedings of the Athenians, since they were aimed equally at themselves, and when they were come to Corinth, delivered an address to them, begging for assistance on the ground of their


6.88.8
4621
καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι εὐθὺς ψηφισάμενοι αὐτοὶ πρῶτοι ὥστε πάσῃ προθυμίᾳ ἀμύνειν , καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα ξυναπέστελλον αὐτοῖς πρέσβεις , ὅπως καὶ ἐκείνους ξυναναπείθοιεν τόν τε αὐτοῦ πόλεμον σαφέστερον ποιεῖσθαι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν ὠφελίαν τινὰ πέμπειν .
connexion. The Corinthians immediately, in the first place, themselves voted to assist them with the greatest zeal, and then sent envoys with them to Lacedaemon, to join in persuading that people also both to carry on the war with the Athenians more openly at home, and to send succours to


6.88.9
4622
καὶ οἵ τε ἐκ τῆς Κορίνθου πρέσβεις παρῆσαν ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδης μετὰ τῶν ξυμφυγάδων περαιωθεὶς τότ’ εὐθὺς ἐπὶ πλοίου φορτηγικοῦ ἐκ τῆς Θουρίας ἐς Κυλλήνην τῆς Ἠλείας πρῶτον , ἔπειτα ὕστερον ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα αὐτῶν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων μεταπεμψάντων ὑπόσπονδος ἐλθών ·
Accordingly the ambassadors from Corinth came to Lacedaemon, and Alcibiades also, with his fellow exiles, who had crossed straightway on board a vessel of burden from Thuria to Cyllene, in the Elean territory, in the first instance, and then afterwards, when the Lacedaemonians themselves had sent for him, proceeded to Lacedaemon under


6.88.9
4623
ἐφοβεῖτο γὰρ αὐτοὺς διὰ τὴν περὶ τῶν Μαντινικῶν πρᾶξιν .
treaty; for he was afraid of them, owing to the part he had taken in the Mantinean business.


6.88.10
4624
καὶ ξυνέβη ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τούς τε Κορινθίους καὶ τοὺς Συρακοσίους τὰ αὐτὰ καὶ τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην δεομένους πείθειν τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους .
And the result was that in the Lacedaemonian assembly the Corinthians, the Syracusans, and Alcibiades, by urging the same request, prevailed on the people there.


6.88.10
4625
καὶ διανοουμένων τῶν τε ἐφόρων καὶ τῶν ἐν τέλει ὄντων πρέσβεις πέμπειν ἐς Συρακούσας κωλύοντας μὴ ξυμβαίνειν Ἀθηναίοις , βοηθεῖν δὲ οὐ προθύμων ὄντων , παρελθὼν ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης παρώξυνέ τε τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ ἐξώρμησε λέγων τοιάδε .
But when the ephors and the authorities, though they purposed sending ambassadors to Syracuse, to urge them to make no terms with the Athenians, were not disposed to assist them, Alcibiades came forward, and exasperated and instigated the Lacedaemonians by addressing them as follows:


6.89.1
4626
&quot; ἀναγκαῖον περὶ τῆς ἐμῆς διαβολῆς πρῶτον ἐς ὑμᾶς εἰπεῖν , ἵνα μὴ χεῖρον τὰ κοινὰ τῷ ὑπόπτῳ μου ἀκροάσησθε .
"It is necessary that I should first address you on the subject of the prejudice felt against me, that you may not, through your suspicions, attend to me the less on matters of public interest.


6.89.2
4627
τῶν δ’ ἐμῶν προγόνων τὴν προξενίαν ὑμῶν κατά τι ἔγκλημα ἀπειπόντων αὐτὸς ἐγὼ πάλιν ἀναλαμβάνων ἐθεράπευον ὑμᾶς ἄλλα τε καὶ περὶ τὴν ἐκ Πύλου ξυμφοράν .
When, then, our ancestors had, on the ground of some quarrel or other, renounced their connexion with you as your  I myself, from a wish to resume it, paid attentions to you, both in other respects, and in the case of your misfortune at Pylus.


6.89.2
4628
καὶ διατελοῦντός μου προθύμου ὑμεῖς πρὸς Ἀθηναίους καταλλασσόμενοι τοῖς μὲν ἐμοῖς ἐχθροῖς δύναμιν δι’ ἐκείνων πράξαντες , ἐμοὶ δὲ ἀτιμίαν περιέθετε .
And when I continued thus zealous, you, at the time you were concluding peace with the Athenians, conferred influence on my enemies, by negotiating through them, but brought dishonour on me.


6.89.3
4629
καὶ διὰ ταῦτα δικαίως ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ πρός τε τὰ Μαντινέων καὶ Ἀργείων τραπομένου καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα ἐνηντιούμην ὑμῖν ἐβλάπτεσθε ·
For these reasons it was with justice that you received harm at my hands, both when I turned to the Mantineans and Argives, and on whatever other occasions I opposed you.


6.89.3
4630
καὶ νῦν , εἴ τις καὶ τότε ἐν τῷ πάσχειν οὐκ εἰκότως ὠργίζετό μοι , μετὰ τοῦ ἀληθοῦς σκοπῶν ἀναπειθέσθω .
And now, if there be any one who at that time, while he was suffering, was unfairly angry with me, let him look at the question in the true light, and be led to a different conviction.


6.89.3
4631
ἢ εἴ τις , διότι καὶ τῷ δήμῳ προσεκείμην μᾶλλον , χείρω με ἐνόμιζε , μηδ’ οὕτως ἡγήσηται ὀρθῶς ἄχθεσθαι .
Or if there be any one who formed a worse opinion of me, because I rather attached myself to the popular party, let him not on this ground, either, suppose that he was with good reason offended at me.


6.89.4
4632
τοῖς γὰρ τυράννοις αἰεί ποτε διάφοροί ἐσμεν ( πᾶν δὲ τὸ ἐναντιούμενον τῷ δυναστεύοντι δῆμος ὠνόμασται ) , καὶ ἀπ’ ἐκείνου ξυμπαρέμεινεν ἡ προστασία ἡμῖν τοῦ πλήθους .
For we have always been foes to tyrants; and all that are opposed to the dominant faction are called by the name of 'people.'


6.89.4
4633
ἅμα δὲ καὶ τῆς πόλεως δημοκρατουμένης τὰ πολλὰ ἀνάγκη ἦν τοῖς παροῦσιν ἕπεσθαι .
It was from this, then, that our taking the lead of the populace continued; and besides, as the state was under a democratical government, it was necessary on most occasions to follow the existing order of things.


6.89.5
4634
τῆς δὲ ὑπαρχούσης ἀκολασίας ἐπειρώμεθα μετριώτεροι ἐς τὰ πολιτικὰ εἶναι .ἄλλοι δ’ ἦσαν καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν πάλαι καὶ νῦν οἳ ἐπὶ τὰ πονηρότερα ἐξῆγον τὸν ὄχλον ·
However, we endeavoured to be more moderate in politics than suited the intemperate spirit which had before prevailed.


6.89.5
4635
οἵπερ καὶ ἐμὲ ἐξήλασαν .
But there were others, both in times of old and now, who led on the populace to worse measures, and banished me.


6.89.6
4636
ἡμεῖς δὲ τοῦ ξύμπαντος προέστημεν , δικαιοῦντες ἐν ᾧ σχήματι μεγίστη ἡ πόλις ἐτύγχανε καὶ ἐλευθερωτάτη οὖσα καὶ ὅπερ ἐδέξατό τις , τοῦτο ξυνδιασῴζειν , ἐπεὶ δημοκρατίαν γε καὶ ἐγιγνώσκομεν οἱ φρονοῦντές τι , καὶ αὐτὸς οὐδενὸς ἂν χεῖρον , ὅσῳ καὶ λοιδορήσαιμι .
But in our case it was the whole body of the people that we headed; thinking it right to assist in preserving that form of government under which the country was most great and free, and which we had received.


6.89.6
4637
ἀλλὰ περὶ ὁμολογουμένης ἀνοίας οὐδὲν ἂν καινὸν λέγοιτο ·
For with regard to democracy, all of us who had any sense knew what it was; and I myself, perhaps, better than any one, in proportion as I could also abuse it more.


6.89.6
4638
καὶ τὸ μεθιστάναι αὐτὴν οὐκ ἐδόκει ἡμῖν ἀσφαλὲς εἶναι ὑμῶν πολεμίων προσκαθημένων .
But of an acknowledged absurdity nothing new could be said; and yet to put it aside did not appear to us safe, while you, as our enemies, were so closely besetting us.


6.90.1
4639
&quot; καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐς τὰς ἐμὰς διαβολὰς τοιαῦτα ξυνέβη ·
"With regard then to your prejudices against me, such were the facts:


6.90.1
4640
περὶ δὲ ὧν ὑμῖν τε βουλευτέον καὶ ἐμοί , εἴ τι πλέον οἶδα , ἐσηγητέον , μάθετε ἤδη .
but with regard to what you must deliberate upon, and I, on whatever point I am better informed, must advise, now learn from me.


6.90.2
4641
ἐπλεύσαμεν ἐς Σικελίαν πρῶτον μέν , εἰ δυναίμεθα , Σικελιώτας καταστρεψόμενοι , μετὰ δ’ ἐκείνους αὖθις καὶ Ἰταλιώτας , ἔπειτα καὶ τῆς Καρχηδονίων ἀρχῆς καὶ αὐτῶν ἀποπειράσοντες .
We sailed to Sicily, in the first place, to subdue the Siceliots, if we could; after them, again, the Italiots; and then also to make an attempt on the dominion of the Carthaginians, and on their own city.


6.90.3
4642
εἰ δὲ προχωρήσειε ταῦτα ἢ πάντα ἢ καὶ τὰ πλείω , ἤδη τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ ἐμέλλομεν ἐπιχειρήσειν , κομίσαντες ξύμπασαν μὲν τὴν ἐκεῖθεν προσγενομένην δύναμιν τῶν Ἑλλήνων , πολλοὺς δὲ βαρβάρους μισθωσάμενοι καὶ Ἴβηρας καὶ ἄλλους τῶν ἐκεῖ ὁμολογουμένως νῦν βαρβάρων μαχιμωτάτους , τριήρεις τε πρὸς ταῖς ἡμετέραις πολλὰς ναυπηγησάμενοι , ἐχούσης τῆς Ἰταλίας ξύλα ἄφθονα , αἷς τὴν Πελοπόννησον πέριξ πολιορκοῦντες καὶ τῷ πεζῷ ἅμα ἐκ γῆς ἐφορμαῖς τῶν πόλεων τὰς μὲν βίᾳ λαβόντες , τὰς δ’ ἐντειχισάμενοι , ῥᾳδίως ἠλπίζομεν καταπολεμήσειν καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ τοῦ ξύμπαντος Ἑλληνικοῦ ἄρξειν .
If either all or most of these schemes proved successful, then we intended to attack the Peloponnese, after bringing here the united force of the Greeks that had joined us in those parts, taking many barbarians into our pay—both Iberians and others of those nations, confessedly the most warlike barbarians at the present day—and building many triremes in addition to what we have, (since Italy contains timber in abundance). Blockading the Peloponnese with these round its coasts, and at the same time attacking it with our soldiers on the land side, after taking some of the cities by storm, and walling in others, we hoped with ease to reduce it, and after that to enjoy the sovereignty of the whole Grecian race.


6.90.4
4643
χρήματα δὲ καὶ σῖτον , ὥστε εὐπορώτερον γίγνεσθαί τι αὐτῶν , αὐτὰ τὰ προσγενόμενα ἐκεῖθεν χωρία ἔμελλε διαρκῆ ἄνευ τῆς ἐνθένδε προσόδου παρέξειν .
And as for money and provisions, to render each of these measures more practicable, the newly acquired places in those quarters would by themselves supply sufficient, independently of our revenues from these parts.


6.91.1
4644
τοιαῦτα μὲν περὶ τοῦ νῦν οἰχομένου στόλου παρὰ τοῦ τὰ ἀκριβέστατα εἰδότος ὡς διενοήθημεν ἀκηκόατε ·
"Thus, then, concerning the expedition which has now sailed, you have heard its objects from the man who knows with the greatest accuracy what we purposed by it:


6.91.1
4645
καὶ ὅσοι ὑπόλοιποι στρατηγοί , ἢν δύνωνται , ὁμοίως αὐτὰ πράξουσιν .
and the generals who still remain there will, if they are able, carry them out in the same way.


6.91.1
4646
ὡς δέ , εἰ μὴ βοηθήσετε οὐ περιέσται τ- ἐκεῖ , μάθετε ἤδη .
But that the people there will not escape their attack, unless you succour them, you must now learn.


6.91.2
4647
Σικελιῶται γὰρ ἀπειρότεροι μέν εἰσιν , ὅμως δ’ ἂν ξυστραφέντες ἁθρόοι καὶ νῦν ἔτι περιγένοιντο ·
The Siceliots indeed, although untrained, might still even now gain the victory, if united in one body.


6.91.2
4648
Συρακόσιοι δὲ μόνοι μάχῃ τε ἤδη πανδημεὶ ἡσσημένοι καὶ ναυσὶν ἅμα κατειργόμενοι ἀδύνατοι ἔσονται τῇ νῦν Ἀθηναίων ἐκεῖ παρασκευῇ ἀντισχεῖν .
But the Syracusans alone, defeated as they have already been in battle with all their forces, and hemmed in by sea at the same time, will be unable to hold out against the Athenian armament now there.


6.91.3
4649
καὶ εἰ αὕτη ἡ πόλις ληφθήσεται , ἔχεται καὶ ἡ πᾶσα Σικελία , καὶ εὐθὺς καὶ Ἰταλία ·
And if that city is taken, the whole of Sicily also is in their possession, and Italy, too, straightway;


6.91.3
4650
καὶ ὃν ἄρτι κίνδυνον ἐκεῖθεν προεῖπον , οὐκ ἂν διὰ μακροῦ ὑμῖν ἐπιπέσοι .
and the danger which I just now mentioned as impending from that quarter, would in no long time fall upon you.


6.91.4
4651
ὥστε μὴ περὶ τῆς Σικελίας τις οἰέσθω μόνον βουλεύειν , ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ τῆς Πελοποννήσου , εἰ μὴ ποιήσετε τάδε ἐν τάχει , στρατιάν τε ἐπὶ νεῶν πέμψετε τοιαύτην ἐκεῖσε οἵτινες αὐτερέται κομισθέντες καὶ ὁπλιτεύσουσιν εὐθύς , καὶ ὃ τῆς στρατιᾶς ἔτι χρησιμώτερον εἶναι νομίζω , ἄνδρα Σπαρτιάτην ἄρχοντα , ὡς ἂν τούς τε παρόντας ξυντάξῃ καὶ τοὺς μὴ ’θέλοντας προσαναγκάσῃ ·
Let no one then think that he is deliberating about Sicily alone, but about the Peloponnese also, unless you quickly adopt these measures;


6.91.4
4652
οὕτω γὰρ οἵ τε ὑπάρχοντες ὑμῖν φίλοι θαρσήσουσι μᾶλλον καὶ οἱ ἐνδοιάζοντες ἀδεέστερον προσίασιν .
unless, I mean, you send thither on board ship such a body of troops, as, after working their own passage, shall immediately act as heavy infantry; and also, what I consider to be still more serviceable than troops, a Spartan as commander, both to discipline their present forces, and to compel those who are unwilling to serve. For so the friends you already have will feel the greater confidence, and those who are doubting between the two sides will more fearlessly join yours.


6.91.5
4653
καὶ τὰ ἐνθάδε χρὴ ἅμα φανερώτερον ἐκπολεμεῖν , ἵνα Συρακόσιοί τε νομίζοντες ὑμᾶς ἐπιμέλεσθαι μᾶλλον ἀντέχωσι καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῖς ἑαυτῶν ἧσσον ἄλλην ἐπικουρίαν πέμπωσιν .
You must also carry on hostilities here in a more decisive manner; that the Syracusans, convinced that you take an interest in them, may offer the greater resistance; and that the Athenians may the less easily send reinforcements to their troops.


6.91.6
4654
τειχίζειν τε χρὴ Δεκέλειαν τῆς Ἀττικῆς , ὅπερ Ἀθηναῖοι μάλιστα αἰεὶ φοβοῦνται , καὶ μόνου αὐτοῦ νομίζουσι τῶν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ οὐ διαπεπειρᾶσθαι .
And for that purpose you must fortify Decelea, in Attica; a blow of which the Athenians have always been most afraid, and the only one which they think they have not experienced in the present war.


6.91.6
4655
βεβαιότατα δ’ ἄν τις οὕτω τοὺς πολεμίους βλάπτοι , εἰ ἃ μάλιστα δεδιότας αὐτοὺς αἰσθάνοιτο , ταῦτα σαφῶς πυνθανόμενος ἐπιφέροι ·
And in that way would one most surely hurt his enemies, if, acting on certain information, he should inflict upon them those things which he knows them to fear most:


6.91.6
4656
εἰκὸς γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἀκριβέστατα ἑκάστους τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν δεινὰ ἐπισταμένους φοβεῖσθαι .
for it is but reasonable that every people should know most accurately its own dangers, and fear them accordingly. But with regard to the difficulties which, while you benefit yourselves, you will create for your opponents by thus fortifying the place, though I pass over many, I will briefly mention the chief.

4657
ἃ δ’ ἐν τῇ ἐπιτειχίσει αὐτοὶ ὠφελούμενοι τοὺς ἐναντίους κωλύσετε , πολλὰ παρεὶς τὰ μέγιστα κεφαλαιώσω .
Whatever then the country is stocked with, the greater part will come to you, either through being captured, or of their own accord.


6.91.7
4658
οἷς τε γὰρ ἡ χώρα κατεσκεύασται , τὰ πολλὰ πρὸς ὑμᾶς τὰ μὲν ληφθέντα , τὰ δ’ αὐτόματα ἥξει ·
They will also at once be deprived of their revenues from the silver mines at Laurium, with the advantages they now derive from their land and their courts of justice;


6.91.7
4659
καὶ τὰς τοῦ Λαυρείου τῶν ἀργυρείων μετάλλων προσόδους καὶ ὅσα ἀπὸ γῆς καὶ δικαστηρίων νῦν ὠφελοῦνται εὐθὺς ἀποστερήσονται , μάλιστα δὲ τῆς ἀπὸ τῶν ξυμμάχων προσόδου ἧσσον διαφορουμένης , οἳ τὰ παρ’ ὑμῶν νομίσαντες ἤδη κατὰ κράτος πολεμεῖσθαι ὀλιγωρήσουσιν .
but, especially, of the revenue from the allies, which will be less regularly paid by them, when they consider that the war on your part is now vigorously prosecuted, and so think lightly of them.


6.92.1
4660
γίγνεσθαι δέ τι αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν τάχει καὶ προθυμότερον ἐν ὑμῖν ἐστίν , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ἐπεὶ ὥς γε δυνατά ( καὶ οὐχ ἁμαρτήσεσθαι οἶμαι γνώμης ) πάνυ θαρσῶ .
"To have each of these things done with greater speed and spirit rests with you, Lacedaemonians; for that they are possible I am very confident, and I do not think that I shall be proved to have been mistaken.  And now, I beg that I may not be the worse thought of by any among you, because I am now strenuously attacking my country with its bitterest enemies, though I formerly had a reputation for patriotism;"


6.92.2
4661
&quot; καὶ χείρων οὐδενὶ ἀξιῶ δοκεῖν ὑμῶν εἶναι , εἰ τῇ ἐμαυτοῦ μετὰ τῶν πολεμιωτάτων φιλόπολίς ποτε δοκῶν εἶναι νῦν ἐγκρατῶς ἐπέρχομαι , οὐδὲ ὑποπτεύεσθαί μου ἐς τὴν φυγαδικὴν προθυμίαν τὸν λόγον .
" and that my words may not be suspected on the score of an exile's forwardness."


6.92.3
4662
φυγάς τε γάρ εἰμι τῆς τῶν ἐξελασάντων πονηρίας , καὶ οὐ τῆς ὑμετέρας , ἢν πείθησθέ μοι , ὠφελίας ·
"For though I am an exile, as regards the villany of those who banished me, I am not one, as regards assistance to you, if you will be persuaded by me:


6.92.3
4663
καὶ πολεμιώτεροι οὐχ οἱ τοὺς πολεμίους που βλάψαντες ὑμεῖς ἢ οἱ τοὺς φίλους ἀναγκάσαντες πολεμίους γενέσθαι .
And the party hostile to me was, not you, who only hurt your foes, but rather they who compelled their friends to become their foes.


6.92.4
4664
τό τε φιλόπολι οὐκ ἐν ᾧ ἀδικοῦμαι ἔχω , ἀλλ’ ἐν ᾧ ἀσφαλῶς ἐπολιτεύθην .
My patriotism, too, I keep not at a time when I am being wronged, but only while I enjoyed my civil rights in security.


6.92.4
4665
οὐδ’ ἐπὶ πατρίδα οὖσαν ἔτι ἡγοῦμαι νῦν ἰέναι , πολὺ δὲ μᾶλλον τὴν οὐκ οὖσαν ἀνακτᾶσθαι .
Nor do I consider myself to be going against what is still my country, but much rather to be recovering that country which is mine no more.


6.92.4
4666
καὶ φιλόπολις οὗτος ὀρθῶς , οὐχ ὃς ἂν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀδίκως ἀπολέσας μὴ ἐπίῃ , ἀλλ’ ὃς ἂν ἐκ παντὸς τρόπου διὰ τὸ ἐπιθυμεῖν πειραθῇ αὐτὴν ἀναλαβεῖν .
And the patriot, in the true sense, is not that man who, when he has unjustly lost his country, abstains from aggression upon it, but he who, because of his longing for it, endeavours by all means to regain it.


6.92.5
4667
οὕτως ἐμοί τε ἀξιῶ ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐς κίνδυνον καὶ ἐς ταλαιπωρίαν πᾶσαν ἀδεῶς χρῆσθαι , ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , γνόντας τοῦτον δὴ τὸν ὑφ’ ἁπάντων προβαλλόμενον λόγον , ὡς εἰ πολέμιός γε ὢν σφόδρα ἔβλαπτον , κἂν φίλος ὢν ἱκανῶς ὠφελοίην , ὅσῳ τὰ μὲν Ἀθηναίων οἶδα , τὰ δ’ ὑμέτερα ᾔκαζον ·
Thus, as far as I am concerned, I beg you, Lacedaemonians, fearlessly to command my services, both for danger and trouble of every kind; knowing that argument which is advanced by all, namely, that if as your enemy I did you very great harm, I might also as your friend do you great service; inasmuch as I know the plans of the Athenians, while I only guess at yours.


6.92.5
4668
καὶ αὐτοὺς νῦν νομίσαντας περὶ μεγίστων δὴ τῶν διαφερόντων βουλεύεσθαι μὴ ἀποκνεῖν τὴν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν τε καὶ ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν στρατείαν , ἵνα τά τε ἐκεῖ βραχεῖ μορίῳ ξυμπαραγενόμενοι μεγάλα σώσητε καὶ Ἀθηναίων τήν τε οὖσαν καὶ τὴν μέλλουσαν δύναμιν καθέλητε , καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα αὐτοί τε ἀσφαλῶς οἰκῆτε καὶ τῆς ἁπάσης Ἑλλάδος ἑκούσης καὶ οὐ βίᾳ , κατ’ εὔνοιαν δὲ ἡγῆσθε &quot; .
I beg too, that on your own part also, being convinced that you are consulting about your greatest interests, you will not shrink from the expedition both against Sicily and Attica; that by joining them with a small part of your forces, you may at once preserve the great states in Sicily, and overthrow the present and future power of the Athenians; and may afterwards live in security yourselves, and enjoy a voluntary supremacy over the whole of Greece, resting not on force but on affection.


6.93.1
4669
ὁ μὲν Ἀλκιβιάδης τοσαῦτα εἶπεν , οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι διανοούμενοι μὲν καὶ αὐτοὶ πρότερον στρατεύειν ἐπὶ τὰς Ἀθήνας , μέλλοντες δ’ ἔτι καὶ περιορώμενοι , πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐπερρώσθησαν διδάξαντος ταῦτα ἕκαστα αὐτοῦ καὶ νομίσαντες παρὰ τοῦ σαφέστατα εἰδότος ἀκηκοέναι ·
Such was the address of Alcibiades. The Lacedaemonians, who of themselves were previously intending to make an expedition against Athens, but were still acting with delay and circumspection, were far more determined, when he had informed them of these several particulars, and when they considered that they had heard them from the man who had most certain knowledge of them.


6.93.2
4670
ὥστε τῇ ἐπιτειχίσει τῆς Δεκελείας προσεῖχον ἤδη τὸν νοῦν καὶ τὸ παραυτίκα καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ πέμπειν τινὰ τιμωρίαν .
So that they now turned their thoughts to the fortification of Decelea, and to immediately sending some assistance to the Sicilians.


6.93.2
4671
καὶ Γύλιππον τὸν Κλεανδρίδου προστάξαντες ἄρχοντα τοῖς Συρακοσίοις ἐκέλευον μετ’ ἐκείνων καὶ τῶν Κορινθίων βουλευόμενον ποιεῖν ὅπῃ ἐκ τῶν παρόντων μάλιστα καὶ τάχιστά τις ὠφελία ἥξει τοῖς ἐκεῖ .
Having appointed therefore Clearidas to the command of the Syracusans, they instructed him to deliberate with that people and the Corinthians, and to provide for succours reaching them on as large a scale, and with as much speed, as present circumstances permitted.


6.93.3
4672
ὁ δὲ δύο μὲν ναῦς τοὺς Κορινθίους ἤδη ἐκέλευέν οἱ πέμπειν ἐς Ἀσίνην , τὰς δὲ λοιπὰς παρασκευάζεσθαι ὅσας διανοοῦνται πέμπειν καί , ὅταν καιρὸς ᾖ , ἑτοίμας εἶναι πλεῖν .
Accordingly he desired the Corinthians to send him at once two ships to Asine, and to let the rest, as many as they purposed sending, be equipped and in readiness to sail, when the proper time came.


6.93.3
4673
ταῦτα δὲ ξυνθέμενοι ἀνεχώρουν ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος .
Having arranged these points, they returned from Lacedaemon.


6.93.4
4674
ἀφίκετο δὲ καὶ ἡ ἐκ τῆς Σικελίας τριήρης τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ἣν ἀπέστειλαν οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἐπί τε χρήματα καὶ ἱππέας .
Now, too, arrived the Athenian trireme from Sicily, which the generals had sent for money and cavalry.


6.93.4
4675
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀκούσαντες ἐψηφίσαντο τήν τε τροφὴν πέμπειν τῇ στρατιᾷ καὶ τοὺς ἱππέας .
And when the Athenians had heard their request, they resolved to send both the supplies for their armament and the cavalry.


6.93.4
4676
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ ἕβδομον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
And so the winter ended, and the seventeenth year of this war, of which Thucydides wrote the history.


6.94.1
4677
ἅμα δὲ τῷ ἦρι εὐθὺς ἀρχομένῳ τοῦ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους οἱ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ Ἀθηναῖοι ἄραντες ἐκ τῆς Κατάνης παρέπλευσαν ἐπὶ Μεγάρων τῶν ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ , οὓς ἐπὶ Γέλωνος τοῦ τυράννου , ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερόν μοι εἴρηται , ἀναστήσαντες Συρακόσιοι αὐτοὶ ἔχουσι τὴν γῆν .
At the very commencement of the spring of the next summer, the Athenians in Sicily put out from Catana, and coasted along towards the Sicilian Megara, from which the Syracusans, in the time of their tyrant Gelo, (as I have before mentioned,) drove out the inhabitants, and themselves continue to occupy the territory.


6.94.2
4678
ἀποβάντες δὲ ἐδῄωσαν τούς τε ἀγροὺς καὶ ἐλθόντες ἐπὶ ἔρυμά τι τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ οὐχ ἑλόντες αὖθις καὶ πεζῇ καὶ ναυσὶ παρακομισθέντες ἐπὶ τὸν Τηρίαν ποταμὸν τό τε πεδίον ἀναβάντες ἐδῄουν καὶ τὸν σῖτον ἐνεπίμπρασαν , καὶ τῶν Συρακοσίων περιτυχόντες τισὶν οὐ πολλοῖς καὶ ἀποκτείναντές τέ τινας καὶ τροπαῖον στήσαντες ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς .
Having landed therefore, they ravaged the country; and after going against a fort of the Syracusans without taking it, they again proceeded both with their land force and ships to the river Terias, and advancing inland, both laid waste the plain, and fired the corn. After falling in with a small body of the Syracusans, killing some of them, and erecting a trophy, they returned to their ships.


6.94.3
4679
καὶ ἀποπλεύσαντες ἐς Κατάνην , ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ἐπισιτισάμενοι , πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ ἐχώρουν ἐπὶ Κεντόριπα , Σικελῶν πόλισμα , καὶ προσαγαγόμενοι ὁμολογίᾳ ἀπῇσαν , πιμπράντες ἅμα τὸν σῖτον τῶν τε Ἰνησσαίων καὶ τῶν Ὑβλαίων .
When they had sailed back to Catana, and supplied themselves with provisions there, they went with their whole force against Centotripa, a town of the Sicels, and returned after getting possession of it by capitulation, burning at the same time the corn of the Inessaeans and Hybleans.


6.94.4
4680
καὶ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Κατάνην καταλαμβάνουσι τούς τε ἱππέας ἥκοντας ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν πεντήκοντα καὶ διακοσίους ἄνευ τῶν ἵππων μετὰ σκευῆς , ὡς αὐτόθεν ἵππων πορισθησομένων , καὶ ἱπποτοξότας τριάκοντα καὶ τάλαντα ἀργυρίου τριακόσια .
On their arrival at Catana, they found the horsemen come from Athens, two hundred and fifty in number, without their horses, but with their equipments, in expectation of horses being provided there, with thirty mounted archers, and three hundred talents of silver.


6.95.1
4681
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ ἦρος καὶ ἐπ’ Ἄργος στρατεύσαντες Λακεδαιμόνιοι μέχρι μὲν Κλεωνῶν ἦλθον , σεισμοῦ δὲ γενομένου ἀπεχώρησαν .
The same summer the Lacedaemonians also marched against Argos, and went as far as Cleonae, but, on the occurrence of an earthquake, returned.


6.95.1
4682
καὶ Ἀργεῖοι μετὰ ταῦτα ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τὴν Θυρεᾶτιν ὅμορον οὖσαν λείαν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων πολλὴν ἔλαβον , ἣ ἐπράθη ταλάντων οὐκ ἔλασσον πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι .
The Argives, after this, made an incursion into the Thyrean country, which lies on their borders, and took much booty from the Lacedaemonians, which was sold for no less than five and twenty talents.


6.95.2
4683
καὶ ὁ Θεσπιῶν δῆμος ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ἐπιθέμενος τοῖς τὰς ἀρχὰς ἔχουσιν οὐ κατέσχεν , ἀλλὰ βοηθησάντων Θηβαίων οἱ μὲν ξυνελήφθησαν , οἱ δ’ ἐξέπεσον Ἀθήναζε .
The commons of the Thespians also, this same summer, and not long after what has been mentioned, having attacked those in office amongst them, did not get the better; but Theban succours having arrived, some of them were made prisoners, and others fled the country and went to Athens.


6.96.1
4684
καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους , ὡς ἐπύθοντο τούς τε ἱππέας ἥκοντας τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ μέλλοντας ἤδη ἐπὶ σφᾶς ἰέναι , νομίσαντες , ἐὰν μὴ τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν κρατήσωσιν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , χωρίου ἀποκρήμνου τε καὶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως εὐθὺς κειμένου , οὐκ ἂν ῥᾳδίως σφᾶς , οὐδ’ εἰ κρατοῖντο μάχῃ , ἀποτειχισθῆναι , διενοοῦντο τὰς προσβάσεις αὐτῶν φυλάσσειν , ὅπως μὴ κατὰ ταύτας λάθωσι σφᾶς ἀναβάντες οἱ πολέμιοι ·
The Syracusans, the same summer, hearing that the cavalry had joined the Athenians, and that they were about to march against them, and thinking that unless the Athenians were masters of Epipolae, a precipitous tract, and lying right above their city, they could not, even if defeated in battle, be easily circumvallated,


6.96.1
4685
οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἄλλῃ γε αὐτοὺς δυνηθῆναι .
they determined to guard the approaches to it, that the enemy might not gain the heights without their observation; for in no other way could they, as they thought, effect it.


6.96.2
4686
ἐξήρτηται γὰρ τὸ ἄλλο χωρίον , καὶ μέχρι τῆς πόλεως ἐπικλινές τ’ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐπιφανὲς πᾶν ἔσω ·
For the rest of the position rises high, sloping down to the city,


6.96.2
4687
καὶ ὠνόμασται ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων διὰ τὸ ἐπιπολῆς τοῦ ἄλλου εἶναι Ἐπιπολαί .
and being all visible within it:


6.96.3
4688
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐξελθόντες πανδημεὶ ἐς τὸν λειμῶνα παρὰ τὸν Ἄναπον ποταμὸν ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ( ἐτύγχανον γὰρ αὐτοῖς καὶ οἱ περὶ τὸν Ἑρμοκράτη στρατηγοὶ ἄρτι παρειληφότες τὴν ἀρχήν ) ἐξέτασίν τε ὅπλων ἐποιοῦντο καὶ ἑξακοσίους λογάδας τῶν ὁπλιτῶν ἐξέκριναν πρότερον , ὧν ἦρχε Διόμιλος φυγὰς ἐξ Ἄνδρου , ὅπως τῶν τε Ἐπιπολῶν εἶεν φύλακες , καὶ ἢν ἐς ἄλλο τι δέῃ , ταχὺ ξυνεστῶτες παραγίγνωνται .
and so it is called by the Syracusans, from lying above the rest, " Epipolae," [or " Overton." ] They, then, went out at day-break with all their forces into the meadow along the course of the river Anapus,(Hermocrates and his colleagues having just come into office as their generals,) and held a review of their heavy-armed, having first selected from those troops a chosen body of six hundred, under the command of Diomilus, an exile from Andros, to be a guard for Epipole, and quickly to muster and present themselves for whatever other service they might be required.


6.97.1
4689
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ταύτης τῆς νυκτὸς τῇ ἐπιγιγνομένῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἐξητάζοντο καὶ ἔλαθον αὐτοὺς παντὶ ἤδη τῷ στρατεύματι ἐκ τῆς Κατάνης σχόντες κατὰ τὸν Λέοντα καλούμενον , ὃς ἀπέχει τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν ἓξ ἢ ἑπτὰ σταδίους , καὶ τοὺς πεζοὺς ἀποβιβάσαντες , ταῖς τε ναυσὶν ἐς τὴν Θάψον καθορμισάμενοι ·
The Athenians, on the other hand, held a review the day following this night, having already, unobserved by them, made the coast with all their armament from Catana, opposite a place called Leon, about six or seven stades from Epipolae, and having landed their soldiers, and brought their ships to anchor at Thapsus;


6.97.1
4690
ἔστι δὲ χερσόνησος μὲν ἐν στενῷ ἰσθμῷ προύχουσα ἐς τὸ πέλαγος , τῆς δὲ Συρακοσίων πόλεως οὔτε πλοῦν οὔτε ὁδὸν πολλὴν ἀπέχει .
where there is a peninsula running out into the sea, with a narrow isthmus, being not far from the city of Syracuse, either by land or by water.


6.97.2
4691
καὶ ὁ μὲν ναυτικὸς στρατὸς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐν τῇ Θάψῳ διασταυρωσάμενος τὸν ἰσθμὸν ἡσύχαζεν ·
The naval armament of the Athenians lay quiet at Thapsus, having thrown a stockade across the peninsula;


6.97.2
4692
ὁ δὲ πεζὸς ἐχώρει εὐθὺς δρόμῳ πρὸς τὰς Ἐπιπολὰς καὶ φθάνει ἀναβὰς κατὰ τὸν Εὐρύηλον πρὶν τοὺς Συρακοσίους αἰσθομένους ἐκ τοῦ λειμῶνος καὶ τῆς ἐξετάσεως παραγενέσθαι .
but the land forces proceeded at full speed to Epipolae, and had time to ascend it, on the side of Euryelus, before the Syracusans, on perceiving it, could come to them from the meadow and the review.


6.97.3
4693
ἐβοήθουν δὲ οἵ τε ἄλλοι , ὡς ἕκαστος τάχους εἶχε , καὶ οἱ περὶ τὸν Διόμιλον ἑξακόσιοι ·
They came, however, against them, both the rest, as quickly as each could, and Diomilus, with his six hundred:


6.97.3
4694
στάδιοι δὲ πρὶν προσμεῖξαι ἐκ τοῦ λειμῶνος ἐγίγνοντο αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἔλασσον ἢ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι .
but they had a distance of not less than five and twenty stades to go, before they came up to them from the meadow.


6.97.4
4695
προσπεσόντες οὖν αὐτοῖς τοιούτῳ τρόπῳ ἀτακτότερον καὶ μάχῃ νικηθέντες οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐπὶ ταῖς Ἐπιπολαῖς ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν πόλιν ·
Falling on them therefore, under these circumstances, in considerable disorder, and being defeated in an engagement at Epipolae, the Syracusans returned into the city,


6.97.4
4696
καὶ ὅ τε Διόμιλος ἀποθνῄσκει καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὡς τριακόσιοι .
Diomilus being killed, and about three hundred of the rest.


6.97.5
4697
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τροπαῖόν τε στήσαντες καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀποδόντες τοῖς Συρακοσίοις , πρὸς τὴν πόλιν αὐτὴν τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ἐπικαταβάντες , ὡς οὐκ ἐπεξῇσαν αὐτοῖς , ἐπαναχωρήσαντες φρούριον ἐπὶ τῷ Λαβδάλῳ ᾠκοδόμησαν , ἐπ’ ἄκροις τοῖς κρημνοῖς τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν , ὁρῶν πρὸς τὰ Μέγαρα , ὅπως εἴη αὐτοῖς , ὁπότε προΐοιεν ἢ μαχούμενοι ἢ τειχιοῦντες , τοῖς τε σκεύεσι καὶ τοῖς χρήμασιν ἀποθήκη .
After this, the Athenians having erected a trophy, and restored to the Syracusans their dead under a truce, came down the next day to the city itself; but when they did not come out against them, they returned, and built a fort on Labdalum, on the highest point of the cliffs of Epiolae, looking towards Megara, to be a magazine for their baggage and treasures, whenever they advanced either to fight or to work at the wall.


6.98.1
4698
καὶ οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον αὐτοῖς ἦλθον ἔκ τε Ἐγέστης ἱππῆς τριακόσιοι καὶ Σικελῶν καὶ Ναξίων καὶ ἄλλων τινῶν ὡς ἑκατόν ·
Not long after, there came to them from Segesta three hundred cavalry, and about a hundred from the Sicels, Naxians, and some others,


6.98.1
4699
καὶ Ἀθηναίων ὑπῆρχον πεντήκοντα καὶ διακόσιοι , οἷς ἵππους τοὺς μὲν παρ’ Ἐγεσταίων καὶ Καταναίων ἔλαβον , τοὺς δ’ ἐπρίαντο , καὶ ξύμπαντες πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑξακόσιοι ἱππῆς ξυνελέγησαν .
while there were already two hundred and fifty from Athens, for whom they had received some horses from the Segestans and Catanaeans, and had bought others; so that altogether a body of six hundred and fifty cavalry was mustered.


6.98.2
4700
καὶ καταστήσαντες ἐν τῷ Λαβδάλῳ φυλακὴν ἐχώρουν πρὸς τὴν Συκῆν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἵναπερ καθεζόμενοι ἐτείχισαν τὸν κύκλον διὰ τάχους .
Having established a garrison in Labdalum, the Athenians advanced to Syca, where they posted themselves.


6.98.2
4701
καὶ ἔκπληξιν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις παρέσχον τῷ τάχει τῆς οἰκοδομίας ·
and built with all speed the central point of their wall of circumvallation.


6.98.2
4702
καὶ ἐπεξελθόντες μάχην διενοοῦντο ποιεῖσθαι καὶ μὴ περιορᾶν .
They struck the Syracusans with consternation by the rapidity of their building; and consequently they resolved to march out against them and give them battle, and not allow them to proceed with the work.


6.98.3
4703
καὶ ἤδη ἀντιπαρατασσομένων ἀλλήλοις οἱ τῶν Συρακοσίων στρατηγοὶ ὡς ἑώρων σφίσι τὸ στράτευμα διεσπασμένον τε καὶ οὐ ῥᾳδίως ξυντασσόμενον , ἀνήγαγον πάλιν ἐς τὴν πόλιν πλὴν μέρους τινὸς τῶν ἱππέων ·
When they were now being drawn up in battle-array against each other, the Syracusan generals, perceiving that their forces were broken, and did not easily fall into line, led them back again into the city,


6.98.3
4704
οὗτοι δὲ ὑπομένοντες ἐκώλυον τοὺς Ἀθηναίους λιθοφορεῖν τε καὶ ἀποσκίδνασθαι μακροτέραν .
excepting some part of their cavalry.


6.98.4
4705
καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων φυλὴ μία τῶν ὁπλιτῶν καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς μετ’ αὐτῶν πάντες ἐτρέψαντο τοὺς τῶν Συρακοσίων ἱππέας προσβαλόντες , καὶ ἀπέκτεινάν τέ τινας καὶ τροπαῖον τῆς ἱππομαχίας ἔστησαν .
These, staying behind, prevented the Athenians from carrying their stones, or dispersing to any great distance; until One tribe of the Athenian heavy-armed, with all their cavalry, charged and routed the Syracusan horse, killed some of them, and erected a trophy for this cavalry action.


6.99.1
4706
καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ μὲν ἐτείχιζον τῶν Ἀθηναίων τὸ πρὸς βορέαν τοῦ κύκλου τεῖχος , οἱ δὲ λίθους καὶ ξύλα ξυμφοροῦντες παρέβαλλον ἐπὶ τὸν Τρωγίλον καλούμενον αἰεί , ᾗπερ βραχύτατον ἐγίγνετο αὐτοῖς ἐκ τοῦ μεγάλου λιμένος ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτέραν θάλασσαν τὸ ἀποτείχισμα .
The next day some of the Athenians were building the wall to the north of the central point, while others were collecting stones and timber, and laying them along the line, to the point called Trogilus; keeping in the direction in which their wall of circumvallation would be completed in the shortest distance from the great harbour to the sea.


6.99.2
4707
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι οὐχ ἥκιστα Ἑρμοκράτους τῶν στρατηγῶν ἐσηγησαμένου μάχαις μὲν πανδημεὶ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους οὐκέτι ἐβούλοντο διακινδυνεύειν , ὑποτειχίζειν δὲ ἄμεινον ἐδόκει εἶναι , ᾗ ἐκεῖνοι ἔμελλον ἄξειν τὸ τεῖχος καί , εἰ φθάσειαν , ἀποκλῄσεις γίγνεσθαι , καὶ ἅμα καὶ ἐν τούτῳ εἰ ἐπιβοηθοῖεν , μέρος ἀντιπέμπειν αὐτοῖς τῆς στρατιᾶς καὶ φθάνειν αὐτοὶ προκαταλαμβάνοντες τοῖς σταυροῖς τὰς ἐφόδους , ἐκείνους δὲ ἂν παυομένους τοῦ ἔργου πάντας ἂν πρὸς σφᾶς τρέπεσθαι .
The Syracusans meanwhile, at the suggestion of Hermocrates, more than of their other generals, were no longer disposed to run the risk of general actions with the Athenians, but thought it better to build a counterwall in the direction in which they intended to carry their works; thinking that if they anticipated them with this, there would be an interruption to their lines; and that, if at that time they should come to oppose them, they themselves would send a part of their forces against them, and have time to occupy the approaches beforehand with their palisade, while the Athenians would cease from their work, and all turn their attention to them.


6.99.3
4708
ἐτείχιζον οὖν ἐξελθόντες ἀπὸ τῆς σφετέρας πόλεως ἀρξάμενοι , κάτωθεν τοῦ κύκλου τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐγκάρσιον τεῖχος ἄγοντες , τάς τε ἐλάας ἐκκόπτοντες τοῦ τεμένους καὶ πύργους ξυλίνους καθιστάντες .
They went out, therefore, and proceeded to build, beginning from their city, and carrying a cross wall below the Athenian lines, cutting down the olives of the sacred ground, and erecting wooden towers.


6.99.4
4709
αἱ δὲ νῆες τῶν Ἀθηναίων οὔπω ἐκ τῆς Θάψου περιεπεπλεύκεσαν ἐς τὸν μέγαν λιμένα , ἀλλ’ ἔτι οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐκράτουν τῶν περὶ τὴν θάλασσαν , κατὰ γῆν δ’ ἐκ τῆς Θάψου οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἐπήγοντο .
The ships of the Athenians had not yet sailed round from Thapsus into the great harbour, but the Syracusans still commanded the sea-shore, and the Athenians conveyed their provisions from Thapsus by land.

4710
ἐπειδὴ δὲ τοῖς Συρακοσίοις ἀρκούντως ἐδόκει ἔχειν ὅσα τε ἐσταυρώθη καὶ ᾠκοδομήθη τοῦ ὑποτειχίσματος , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι αὐτοὺς οὐκ ἦλθον κωλύσοντες , φοβούμενοι μὴ σφίσι δίχα γιγνομένοις ῥᾷον μάχωνται , καὶ ἅμα τὴν καθ’ αὑτοὺς περιτείχισιν ἐπειγόμενοι , οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι φυλὴν μίαν καταλιπόντες φύλακα τοῦ οἰκοδομήματος ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν πόλιν , οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι τούς τε ὀχετοὺς αὐτῶν , οἳ ἐς τὴν πόλιν ὑπονομηδὸν ποτοῦ ὕδατος ἠγμένοι ἦσαν , διέφθειραν , καὶ τηρήσαντες τούς τε ἄλλους Συρακοσίους κατὰ σκηνὰς ὄντας ἐν μεσημβρίᾳ καί τινας καὶ ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἀποκεχωρηκότας καὶ τοὺς ἐν τῷ σταυρώματι ἀμελῶς φυλάσσοντας , τριακοσίους μὲν σφῶν αὐτῶν λογάδας καὶ τῶν ψιλῶν τινὰς ἐκλεκτοὺς ὡπλισμένους προύταξαν θεῖν δρόμῳ ἐξαπιναίως πρὸς τὸ ὑποτείχισμα , ἡ δ’ ἄλλη στρατιὰ δίχα , ἡ μὲν μετὰ τοῦ ἑτέρου στρατηγοῦ πρὸς τὴν πόλιν , εἰ ἐπιβοηθοῖεν , ἐχώρουν , ἡ δὲ μετὰ τοῦ ἑτέρου πρὸς τὸ σταύρωμα τὸ παρὰ τὴν πυλίδα .
When the Syracusans thought that those parts of their counter-work which had been completed by means of palisades and masonry were sufficient, and when the Athenians did not come out to stop them, as they feared that the enemy would more easily contend with them when they were divided, and at the same time were hurrying to complete their own wall of circumvallation; the Syracusans, having left one tribe to guard the building, returned into the city. The Athenians, in the mean time, destroyed their pipes which ran under ground into the city, carrying water for drinking; and having watched when the rest of the Syracusans were in their tents at mid-day, and some of them had even gone away into the city, while those in the stockade were keeping but a careless guard, they appointed three hundred picked men of themselves, and a chosen body of the light troops, armed for the purpose, to run suddenly at full speed to the counter-work, while the rest of the army advanced in two divisions, one with one of the generals to the city, in case they should come to the rescue, the other with the other general to the stockade near the postern.


6.100.2
4711
καὶ προσβαλόντες οἱ τριακόσιοι αἱροῦσι τὸ σταύρωμα ·
Accordingly the three hundred assaulted and took the stockade,


6.100.2
4712
καὶ οἱ φύλακες αὐτὸ ἐκλιπόντες κατέφυγον ἐς τὸ προτείχισμα τὸ περὶ τὸν Τεμενίτην .
the guard evacuating it, and taking refuge in the outworks around Temenites.


6.100.2
4713
καὶ αὐτοῖς ξυνεσέπεσον οἱ διώκοντες , καὶ ἐντὸς γενόμενοι βίᾳ ἐξεκρούσθησαν πάλιν ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων , καὶ τῶν Ἀργείων τινὲς αὐτόθι καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων οὐ πολλοὶ διεφθάρησαν .
Their pursuers also burst in with them, but, after getting in, were forcibly driven out again by the Syracusans, and some few of the Argives and Athenians were slain there.


6.100.3
4714
καὶ ἐπαναχωρήσασα ἡ πᾶσα στρατιὰ τήν τε ὑποτείχισιν καθεῖλον καὶ τὸ σταύρωμα ἀνέσπασαν καὶ διεφόρησαν τοὺς σταυροὺς παρ’ ἑαυτοὺς καὶ τροπαῖον ἔστησαν .
And now the whole army having returned, threw down the wall, tore up the palisades, transferred the pales to their own lines, and erected a trophy.


6.101.1
4715
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἀπὸ τοῦ κύκλου ἐτείχιζον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸν κρημνὸν τὸν ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἕλους , ὃς τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν ταύτῃ πρὸς τὸν μέγαν λιμένα ὁρᾷ , καὶ ᾗπερ αὐτοῖς βραχύτατον ἐγίγνετο καταβᾶσι διὰ τοῦ ὁμαλοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἕλους ἐς τὸν λιμένα τὸ περιτείχισμα .
The next day the Athenians, setting out from their lines, began to build at the cliffs over the marsh, which on this side of Epipolae looks towards the great harbour, and in which direction their wall of circumvallation would be finished in the shortest distance by their going down over the plain and the marsh to the harbour.


6.101.2
4716
καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐν τούτῳ ἐξελθόντες καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀπεσταύρουν αὖθις ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως διὰ μέσου τοῦ ἕλους , καὶ τάφρον ἅμα παρώρυσσον , ὅπως μὴ οἷόν τε ᾖ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις μέχρι τῆς θαλάσσης ἀποτειχίσαι .
The Syracusans meanwhile went out, and on their part also began again to interrupt the line by a palisade, commencing from the city across the middle of the marsh;


6.101.3
4717
οἱ δ’ , ἐπειδὴ τὸ πρὸς τὸν κρημνὸν αὐτοῖς ἐξείργαστο , ἐπιχειροῦσιν αὖθις τῷ τῶν Συρακοσίων σταυρώματι καὶ τάφρῳ , τὰς μὲν ναῦς κελεύσαντες περιπλεῦσαι ἐκ τῆς Θάψου ἐς τὸν μέγαν λιμένα τὸν τῶν Συρακοσίων , αὐτοὶ δὲ περὶ ὄρθρον καταβάντες ἀπὸ τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν ἐς τὸ ὁμαλὸν καὶ διὰ τοῦ ἕλους , ᾗ πηλῶδες ἦν καὶ στεριφώτατον , θύρας καὶ ξύλα πλατέα ἐπιθέντες καὶ ἐπ’ αὐτῶν διαβαδίσαντες , αἱροῦσιν ἅμα ἕῳ τό τε σταύρωμα πλὴν ὀλίγου καὶ τὴν τάφρον , καὶ ὕστερον καὶ τὸ ὑπολειφθὲν εἷλον .
and at the same time dug a ditch parallel with it, that it might not be possible for the Athenians to carry their wall of circumvallation as far as the sea. They, after their work at the cliff was completed, again assaulted the palisade and ditch of the Syracusans. They had ordered their fleet to sail round from Thapsus to the great harbour of Syracuse, while they themselves descended at dawn from Epipolae into the plain, and laying doors and planks over the marsh, where the mud was most firm, crossed it upon them, and in the morning carried the palisade, excepting a small part of it, and the ditch, and afterwards the remaining part.


6.101.4
4718
καὶ μάχη ἐγένετο , καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ ἐνίκων οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι .
On this occasion a battle was fought, in which the Athenians were victorious,


6.101.4
4719
καὶ τῶν Συρακοσίων οἱ μὲν τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας ἔχοντες πρὸς τὴν πόλιν ἔφευγον , οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ τῷ εὐωνύμῳ παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν .
those of the Syracusans posted on the right wing flying to the city, those on the left, to the river.


6.101.4
4720
καὶ αὐτοὺς βουλόμενοι ἀποκλῄσασθαι τῆς διαβάσεως οἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων τριακόσιοι λογάδες δρόμῳ ἠπείγοντο πρὸς τὴν γέφυραν .
Wishing to intercept the passage of these, the three hundred chosen troops of the Athenians pressed on at full speed to the bridge;


6.101.5
4721
δείσαντες δὲ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ( ἦσαν γὰρ καὶ τῶν ἱππέων αὐτοῖς οἱ πολλοὶ ἐνταῦθα ) ὁμόσε χωροῦσι τοῖς τριακοσίοις τούτοις , καὶ τρέπουσί τε αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐσβάλλουσιν ἐς τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας τῶν Ἀθηναίων ·
but the Syracusans were alarmed, and, as the greater part of their forces were there, closed on these three hundred, routed them, and drove them in on the right wing of the Athenians.


6.101.5
4722
καὶ προσπεσόντων αὐτῶν ξυνεφοβήθη καὶ ἡ πρώτη φυλὴ τοῦ κέρως .
By their charge the tribe posted first on the wing was also thrown into panic;


6.101.6
4723
ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ Λάμαχος παρεβοήθει ἀπὸ τοῦ εὐωνύμου τοῦ ἑαυτῶν μετὰ τοξοτῶν τε οὐ πολλῶν καὶ τοὺς Ἀργείους παραλαβών , καὶ ἐπιδιαβὰς τάφρον τινὰ καὶ μονωθεὶς μετ’ ὀλίγων τῶν ξυνδιαβάντων ἀποθνῄσκει αὐτός τε καὶ πέντε ἢ ἓξ τῶν μετ’ αὐτοῦ .
on observing which, Lamachus came to their assistance from their left, with a few archers and the Argives, and having crossed a ditch in advance, and being cut off from the rest, with only a few who had crossed with him, was killed with five or six of his men.


6.101.6
4724
καὶ τούτους μὲν οἱ Συρακόσιοι εὐθὺς κατὰ τάχος φθάνουσιν ἁρπάσαντες πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἐς τὸ ἀσφαλές , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐπιόντος ἤδη καὶ τοῦ ἄλλου στρατεύματος τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπεχώρουν .
These the Syracusans immediately snatched up, and had time to get over the river into a place of security; while their own troops retreated, as the rest of the Athenian force was now coming against them.


6.102.1
4725
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ οἱ πρὸς τὴν πόλιν αὐτῶν τὸ πρῶτον καταφυγόντες ὡς ἑώρων ταῦτα γιγνόμενα , αὐτοί τε πάλιν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἀναθαρσήσαντες ἀντετάξαντο πρὸς τοὺς κατὰ σφᾶς Ἀθηναίους , καὶ μέρος τι αὑτῶν πέμπουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν κύκλον τὸν ἐπὶ ταῖς Ἐπιπολαῖς , ἡγούμενοι ἐρῆμον αἱρήσειν .
Meanwhile, those of them who had at first fled for refuge to their city, when they saw what was going on, resumed their courage, and coming thence, themselves drew up against the Athenians in front of them, and sent a part of their numbers to the lines on Epipolae, thinking they should take them while unguarded.


6.102.2
4726
καὶ τὸ μὲν δεκάπλεθρον προτείχισμα αὐτῶν αἱροῦσι καὶ διεπόρθησαν , αὐτὸν δὲ τὸν κύκλον Νικίας διεκώλυσεν ·
And they did, indeed, take and destroy their outwork of a thousand feet in length, but the lines themselves Nicias prevented their taking, as he happened to have been left behind in them through illness.


6.102.2
4727
ἔτυχε γὰρ ἐν αὐτῷ δι’ ἀσθένειαν ὑπολελειμμένος .
He ordered the servants to set fire to the engines, and all the timber that had been thrown down in front of the wall;


6.102.2
4728
τὰς γὰρ μηχανὰς καὶ ξύλα ὅσα πρὸ τοῦ τείχους ἦν καταβεβλημένα , ἐμπρῆσαι τοὺς ὑπηρέτας ἐκέλευσεν , ὡς ἔγνω ἀδυνάτους ἐσομένους ἐρημίᾳ ἀνδρῶν ἄλλῳ τρόπῳ περιγενέσθαι .
as he knew that for want of men they could not escape in any other way.


6.102.3
4729
καὶ ξυνέβη οὕτως ·
And such was the result;


6.102.3
4730
οὐ γὰρ ἔτι προσῆλθον οἱ Συρακόσιοι διὰ τὸ πῦρ , ἀλλὰ ἀπεχώρουν πάλιν .
for the Syracusans no longer came against them on account of the fire, but withdrew again.


6.102.3
4731
καὶ γὰρ πρός τε τὸν κύκλον βοήθεια ἤδη κάτωθεν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀποδιωξάντων τοὺς ἐκεῖ ἐπανῄει , καὶ αἱ νῆες ἅμα αὐτῶν ἐκ τῆς Θάψου , ὥσπερ εἴρητο , κατέπλεον ἐς τὸν μέγαν λιμένα .
Indeed, by this time succours had gone up to the lines from the Athenians below, who had repulsed the enemy in that part; and at the same time their ships from Thapsus were sailing, as they had been ordered, into the great harbour.


6.102.4
4732
ἃ ὁρῶντες οἱ ἄνωθεν κατὰ τάχος ἀπῇσαν καὶ ἡ ξύμπασα στρατιὰ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐς τὴν πόλιν , νομίσαντες μὴ ἂν ἔτι ἀπὸ τῆς παρούσης σφίσι δυνάμεως ἱκανοὶ γενέσθαι κωλῦσαι τὸν ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν τειχισμόν .
At the sight of this, those on the heights retreated with all speed, and the whole army of the Syracusans retired into the city, thinking that they would no longer be able with their present force to prevent the building of the wall down to the sea.


6.103.1
4733
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τροπαῖον ἔστησαν καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις καὶ τοὺς μετὰ Λαμάχου καὶ αὐτὸν ἐκομίσαντο ·
After this, the Athenians erected a trophy, restoring their dead to the Syracusans under a truce, and receiving back those who had fallen with Lamachus, as well as himself.


6.103.1
4734
καὶ παρόντος ἤδη σφίσι παντὸς τοῦ στρατεύματος καὶ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ καὶ τοῦ πεζοῦ , ἀπὸ τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν καὶ τοῦ κρημνώδους ἀρξάμενοι ἀπετείχιζον μέχρι τῆς θαλάσσης τείχει διπλῷ τοὺς Συρακοσίους .
And as they now had with them their whole force, both naval and military, they began from Epipolae and the cliffs, and circumvallated the Syracusans down to the sea with a double wall.


6.103.2
4735
τὰ δ’ ἐπιτήδεια τῇ στρατιᾷ ἐσήγετο ἐκ τῆς Ἰταλίας πανταχόθεν .
Provisions were now brought for the armament from all parts of Italy.


6.103.2
4736
ἦλθον δὲ καὶ τῶν Σικελῶν πολλοὶ ξύμμαχοι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , οἳ πρότερον περιεωρῶντο , καὶ ἐκ τῆς Τυρσηνίας νῆες πεντηκόντοροι τρεῖς .
Many of the Sicels too, who before were looking to see how things went, came as allies to the Athenians; as did also three fifty-oared galleys from Tyrrhenia.


6.103.2
4737
καὶ τ- ἄλλα προυχώρει αὐτοῖς ἐς ἐλπίδας .
And everything else was prospering, so as to give them hope.


6.103.3
4738
καὶ γὰρ οἱ Συρακόσιοι πολέμῳ μὲν οὐκέτι ἐνόμιζον ἂν περιγενέσθαι , ὡς αὐτοῖς οὐδὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ὠφελία οὐδεμία ἧκε , τοὺς δὲ λόγους ἔν τε σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἐποιοῦντο ξυμβατικοὺς καὶ πρὸς τὸν Νικίαν ·
For the Syracusans no longer thought that they could escape by military measures, since no assistance had reached them from the Peloponnese;


6.103.3
4739
οὗτος γὰρ δὴ μόνος εἶχε Λαμάχου τεθνεῶτος τὴν ἀρχήν .
but were proposing terms of capitulation, both among themselves and to Nicias: for he alone held the command since the death of Lamachus.


6.103.4
4740
καὶ κύρωσις μὲν οὐδεμία ἐγίγνετο , οἷα δὲ εἰκὸς ἀνθρώπων ἀπορούντων καὶ μᾶλλον ἢ πρὶν πολιορκουμένων , πολλὰ ἐλέγετο πρός τε ἐκεῖνον καὶ πλείω ἔτι κατὰ τὴν πόλιν .
No decision, indeed, was come to; but, as was natural for men who were in difficulties, and besieged more closely than before, many discussions were held with him, and still more in the city.


6.103.4
4741
καὶ γάρ τινα καὶ ὑποψίαν ὑπὸ τῶν παρόντων κακῶν ἐς ἀλλήλους εἶχον , καὶ τοὺς στρατηγούς τε ἐφ’ ὧν αὐτοῖς ταῦτα ξυνέβη ἔπαυσαν , ὡς ἢ δυστυχίᾳ ἢ προδοσίᾳ τῇ ἐκείνων βλαπτόμενοι , καὶ ἄλλους ἀνθείλοντο , Ἡρακλείδην καὶ Εὐκλέα καὶ Τελλίαν .
For they also entertained some suspicion of one another, in consequence of their present misfortunes, and deposed the generals under whose command these things had befallen them—thinking that it was either through bad fortune, or treason, that they were suffering—and chose others in their stead, namely, Heraclides, Eucles, and Tellias.


6.104.1
4742
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ Γύλιππος ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος καὶ αἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Κορίνθου νῆες περὶ Λευκάδα ἤδη ἦσαν , βουλόμενοι ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν διὰ τάχους βοηθῆσαι .
In the meantime, Gylippus, the Lacedaemonian, and the ships from Corinth, were now off Leucas, wishing to come to the aid of Sicily with all speed.


6.104.1
4743
καὶ ὡς αὐτοῖς αἱ ἀγγελίαι ἐφοίτων δειναὶ καὶ πᾶσαι ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐψευσμέναι ὡς ἤδη παντελῶς ἀποτετειχισμέναι αἱ Συράκουσαί εἰσι , τῆς μὲν Σικελίας οὐκέτι ἐλπίδα οὐδεμίαν εἶχεν ὁ Γύλιππος , τὴν δὲ Ἰταλίαν βουλόμενος περιποιῆσαι αὐτὸς μὲν καὶ Πυθὴν ὁ Κορίνθιος ναυσὶ δυοῖν μὲν Λακωνικαῖν , δυοῖν δὲ Κορινθίαιν ὅτι τάχιστα ἐπεραιώθησαν τὸν Ἰόνιον ἐς Τάραντα , οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι πρὸς ταῖς σφετέραις δέκα Λευκαδίας δύο καὶ Ἀμπρακιώτιδας τρεῖς προσπληρώσαντες ὕστερον ἔμελλον πλεύσεσθαι .
When therefore tidings were carried to them of an alarming nature, and all concurring in the same falsehood, namely, that Syracuse was by this time entirely circumvallated, Gylippus had no longer any hope of Sicily; but wishing to save Italy, he himself, and Pythen the Corinthian, with two Laconian and two Corinthian ships, crossed the Ionian Sea as quickly as possible to Tarentum; while the Corinthians, having manned, in addition to their own ten, two Leucadian and three Ambracian vessels, were to sail after them.


6.104.2
4744
καὶ ὁ μὲν Γύλιππος ἐκ τοῦ Τάραντος ἐς τὴν Θουρίαν πρῶτον πρεσβευσάμενος καὶ τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς ἀνανεωσάμενος πολιτείαν καὶ οὐ δυνάμενος αὐτοὺς προσαγαγέσθαι , ἄρας παρέπλει τὴν Ἰταλίαν , καὶ ἁρπασθεὶς ὑπ’ ἀνέμου κατὰ τὸν Τεριναῖον κόλπον , ὃς ἐκπνεῖ ταύτῃ μέγας κατὰ βορέαν ἑστηκώς , ἀποφέρεται ἐς τὸ πέλαγος , καὶ πάλιν χειμασθεὶς ἐς τὰ μάλιστα τῷ Τάραντι προσμίσγει ·
Gylippus, then, having first gone on an embassy from Tarentum to Thuria, on the ground of his father's having formerly been presented with the franchise there, and not being able to bring them over, weighed anchor, and coasted along Italy.


6.104.2
4745
καὶ τὰς ναῦς , ὅσαι μάλιστα ἐπόνησαν ὑπὸ τοῦ χειμῶνος , ἀνελκύσας ἐπεσκεύαζεν .
Having been caught, when opposite the Terinaean gulf, by a wind which in this quarter blows violently and steadily from the north, he was carried out to sea, and after enduring exceedingly foul weather, again made Tarentum, and there drew up and refitted such of his ships as had suffered from the tempest.


6.104.3
4746
ὁ δὲ Νικίας πυθόμενος αὐτὸν προσπλέοντα ὑπερεῖδε τὸ πλῆθος τῶν νεῶν , ὅπερ καὶ οἱ Θούριοι ἔπαθον , καὶ λῃστικώτερον ἔδοξε παρεσκευασμένους πλεῖν , καὶ οὐδεμίαν φυλακήν πω ἐποιεῖτο .
Nicias on hearing of his approach, despised the number of his ships, (as had been the feeling of the Thurians also,) and thought that they were sailing more like a piratical armament than any thing else; and so at present he took no precautions against him.


6.105.1
4747
κατὰ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τούτου τοῦ θέρους καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐς τὸ Ἄργος ἐσέβαλον αὐτοί τε καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι καὶ τῆς γῆς τὴν πολλὴν ἐδῄωσαν , καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι Ἀργείοις τριάκοντα ναυσὶν ἐβοήθησαν ·
About the same period of this summer, the Lacedaemonians invaded Argos, themselves and their allies, and ravaged the greater part of the country.


6.105.1
4748
αἵπερ τὰς σπονδὰς φανερώτατα τὰς πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους αὐτοῖς ἔλυσαν .
The Athenians went to the assistance of the Argives with thirty ships; and it was these that broke their treaty with the Lacedaemonians in a most decisive manner.


6.105.2
4749
πρότερον μὲν γὰρ λῃστείαις ἐκ Πύλου καὶ περὶ τὴν ἄλλην Πελοπόννησον μᾶλλον ἢ ἐς τὴν Λακωνικὴν ἀποβαίνοντες μετά τε Ἀργείων καὶ Μαντινέων ξυνεπολέμουν , καὶ πολλάκις Ἀργείων κελευόντων ὅσον σχόντας μόνον ξὺν ὅπλοις ἐς τὴν Λακωνικὴν καὶ τὸ ἐλάχιστον μετὰ σφῶν δῃώσαντας ἀπελθεῖν οὐκ ἤθελον ·
For before this they only joined in hostilities with the Argives and Mantineans by plundering excursions from Pylus, and by landing on the other coasts around the Peloponnese, rather than on the Laconian; and though the Argives often desired them only to touch at Laconia with their heavy-armed, and to withdraw after devastating it with them ever so little, they would not do it.


6.105.2
4750
τότε δὲ Πυθοδώρου καὶ Λαισποδίου καὶ Δημαράτου ἀρχόντων ἀποβάντες ἐς Ἐπίδαυρον τὴν Λιμηρὰν καὶ Πρασιὰς καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα ἐδῄωσαν τῆς γῆς , καὶ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἤδη εὐπροφάσιστον μᾶλλον τὴν αἰτίαν ἐς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τοῦ ἀμύνεσθαι ἐποίησαν .
But at that time, having landed under the command of Pythodorus, Laespodias, and Demaratus, at Epidaurus Limera, Prasiae, and other places, they ravaged part of the territory, and so rendered the excuse of the Lacedaemonians more plausible now for defending themselves against the Athenians.


6.105.3
4751
ἀναχωρησάντων δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐκ τοῦ Ἄργους ταῖς ναυσὶ καὶ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τὴν Φλειασίαν τῆς τε γῆς αὐτῶν ἔτεμον καὶ ἀπέκτεινάν τινας , καὶ ἀπῆλθον ἐπ’ οἴκου .
After the Athenians had with their fleet withdrawn from Argos, and the Lacedaemonians also, the Argives having made an irruption into the Phiasian territory, ravaged part of their land, killed some of their men, and returned home.



7.1.1
4752
ὁ δὲ Γύλιππος καὶ ὁ Πυθὴν ἐκ τοῦ Τάραντος , ἐπεὶ ἐπεσκεύασαν τὰς ναῦς , παρέπλευσαν ἐς Λοκροὺς τοὺς Ἐπιζεφυρίους ·
Gylippus and Pythen, after refitting their ships, sailed along the coast from Tarentum to Locri Epizephyrii.


7.1.1
4753
καὶ πυνθανόμενοι σαφέστερον ἤδη ὅτι οὐ παντελῶς πω ἀποτετειχισμέναι αἱ Συράκουσαί εἰσιν , ἀλλ’ ἔτι οἷόν τε κατὰ τὰς Ἐπιπολὰς στρατιᾷ ἀφικομένους ἐσελθεῖν , ἐβουλεύοντο εἴτ’ ἐν δεξιᾷ λαβόντες τὴν Σικελίαν διακινδυνεύσωσιν ἐσπλεῦσαι , εἴτ’ ἐν ἀριστερᾷ ἐς Ἱμέραν πρῶτον πλεύσαντες καὶ αὐτούς τε ἐκείνους καὶ στρατιὰν ἄλλην προσλαβόντες , οὓς ἂν πείθωσι , κατὰ γῆν ἔλθωσιν .
And now, on receiving more correct information, namely, that Syracuse was not yet entirely invested, but that it was still possible for a party coming with troops to enter it on the side of Epipole, they deliberated whether they should keep Sicily on their right hand, and so run the risk of sailing into it; or whether, keeping it on the left hand, they should first sail to Himera, and take with them both the people there, and any other forces that they might prevail on to join them, and so proceed by land.


7.1.2
4754
καὶ ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τῆς Ἱμέρας πλεῖν , ἄλλως τε καὶ τῶν Ἀττικῶν τεσσάρων νεῶν οὔπω παρουσῶν ἐν τῷ Ῥηγίῳ , ἃς ὁ Νικίας ὅμως πυνθανόμενος αὐτοὺς ἐν Λοκροῖς εἶναι ἀπέστειλεν .
They determined, then, to sail for Himera, especially as the four Athenian ships had not yet arrived at Rhegium, which Nicias, on hearing of their being at Locri, notwithstanding his contempt for them, had sent out.


7.1.2
4755
φθάσαντες δὲ τὴν φυλακὴν ταύτην περαιοῦνται διὰ τοῦ πορθμοῦ , καὶ σχόντες Ῥηγίῳ καὶ Μεσσήνῃ ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς Ἱμέραν .
Having anticipated therefore this guard-squadron, they crossed over the strait, and after touching at Rhegium and Messana, arrived at Himera.


7.1.3
4756
ἐκεῖ δὲ ὄντες τούς τε Ἱμεραίους ἔπεισαν ξυμπολεμεῖν καὶ αὐτούς τε ἕπεσθαι καὶ τοῖς ἐκ τῶν νεῶν τῶν σφετέρων ναύταις ὅσοι μὴ εἶχον ὅπλα παρασχεῖν ( τὰς γὰρ ναῦς ἀνείλκυσαν ἐν Ἱμέρᾳ ) , καὶ τοὺς Σελινουντίους πέμψαντες ἐκέλευον ἀπαντᾶν πανστρατιᾷ ἔς τι χωρίον .
While they were there, they persuaded the Himeraeans to join them in the war, and both themselves to accompany them, and to furnish arms for such of the seamen from their ships as had none, (for they had drawn up their ships on shore at Himera.) They also sent and desired the Selinuntines to meet them at a certain place with all their forces.


7.1.4
4757
πέμψειν δέ τινα αὐτοῖς ὑπέσχοντο στρατιὰν οὐ πολλὴν καὶ οἱ Γελῷοι καὶ τῶν Σικελῶν τινές , οἳ πολὺ προθυμότερον προσχωρεῖν ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν τοῦ τε Ἀρχωνίδου νεωστὶ τεθνηκότος , ὃς τῶν ταύτῃ Σικελῶν βασιλεύων τινῶν καὶ ὢν οὐκ ἀδύνατος τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις φίλος ἦν ,καὶ τοῦ Γυλίππου ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος προθύμως δοκοῦντος ἥκειν .
That people promised to send them a force of no inconsiderable amount, as did the Geloans also, and some of the. Sicels, who were ready to join them with much greater forwardness, both in consequence of the recent death of Archonidas, who, being king over some of the Sicels in that part, and a man of considerable influence, was a friend of the Athenians, and because Gylippus was thought to have come from Lacedaemon in a spirited manner.


7.1.5
4758
καὶ ὁ μὲν Γύλιππος ἀναλαβὼν τῶν τε σφετέρων ναυτῶν καὶ ἐπιβατῶν τοὺς ὡπλισμένους ἑπτακοσίους μάλιστα , Ἱμεραίους δὲ ὁπλίτας καὶ ψιλοὺς ξυναμφοτέρους χιλίους καὶ ἱππέας ἑκατὸν καὶ Σελινουντίων τέ τινας ψιλοὺς καὶ ἱππέας καὶ Γελῴων ὀλίγους , Σικελῶν τε ἐς χιλίους τοὺς πάντας , ἐχώρει πρὸς τὰς Συρακούσας ·
Thus Gylippus took with him those of his own seamen and  who were provided with arms, about seven hundred in number, the Himeraean heavy and light troops, together mustering about a thousand, with a hundred horse, some light-armed and horse of the Selinuntines, a few Geloans, and a thousand Sicels in all, and so advanced against Syracuse.


7.2.1
4759
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Λευκάδος Κορίνθιοι ταῖς τε ἄλλαις ναυσὶν ὡς εἶχον τάχους ἐβοήθουν καὶ Γογγύλος , εἷς τῶν Κορινθίων ἀρχόντων , μιᾷ νηὶ τελευταῖος ὁρμηθεὶς πρῶτος μὲν ἀφικνεῖται ἐς τὰς Συρακούσας , ὀλίγον δὲ πρὸ Γυλίππου , καὶ καταλαβὼν αὐτοὺς περὶ ἀπαλλαγῆς τοῦ πολέμου μέλλοντας ἐκκλησιάσειν διεκώλυσέ τε καὶ παρεθάρσυνε , λέγων ὅτι νῆές τε ἄλλαι ἔτι προσπλέουσι καὶ Γύλιππος ὁ Κλεανδρίδου Λακεδαιμονίων ἀποστειλάντων ἄρχων .
The Corinthians, meanwhile, were coming to their assistance from Leucas with their other ships as quickly as they could, and Gongylus, one of the Corinthian commanders, who had put to sea last of all with a single vessel, arrived first at Syracuse, though but a little before Gylippus. Finding them on the point of holding an assembly to consult on bringing the war to a conclusion, he prevented their doing so, and reassured:


7.2.2
4760
καὶ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι ἐπερρώσθησάν τε καὶ τῷ Γυλίππῳ εὐθὺς πανστρατιᾷ ὡς ἀπαντησόμενοι ἐξῆλθον ·
Upon this the Syracusans were reassured, and immediately went out in full force for the purpose of meeting Gylippus;


7.2.2
4761
ἤδη γὰρ καὶ ἐγγὺς ὄντα ᾐσθάνοντο αὐτόν .
for by this time they perceived him actually near at hand.


7.2.3
4762
ὁ δὲ Ἰέτας τότε τι τεῖχος ἐν τῇ παρόδῳ τῶν Σικελῶν ἑλὼν καὶ ξυνταξάμενος ὡς ἐς μάχην ἀφικνεῖται ἐς τὰς Ἐπιπολάς ·
He, having taken on his passage Jetae, a fortress of the Sicels, and having formed his men for battle, arrived at Epipolae;


7.2.3
4763
καὶ ἀναβὰς κατὰ τὸν Εὐρύηλον , ᾗπερ καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸ πρῶτον , ἐχώρει μετὰ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐπὶ τὸ τείχισμα τῶν Ἀθηναίων .
after mounting which, on the side by Euryelus, where the Athenians also had ascended at first, he advanced in company with the Syracusans against the Athenian lines.


7.2.4
4764
ἔτυχε δὲ κατὰ τοῦτο τοῦ καιροῦ ἐλθὼν ἐν ᾧ ἑπτὰ μὲν ἢ ὀκτὼ σταδίων ἤδη ἀπετετέλεστο τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐς τὸν μέγαν λιμένα διπλοῦν τεῖχος , πλὴν κατὰ βραχύ τι τὸ πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν ( τοῦτο δ’ ἔτι ᾠκοδόμουν ) , τῷ δὲ ἄλλῳ τοῦ κύκλου πρὸς τὸν Τρωγίλον ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτέραν θάλασσαν λίθοι τε παραβεβλημένοι τῷ πλέονι ἤδη ἦσαν , καὶ ἔστιν ἃ καὶ ἡμίεργα , τὰ δὲ καὶ ἐξειργασμένα κατελέλειπτο .
He happened to have come at so critical a time, that a double wall of seven or eight stades length had already been completed by the Athenians, extending to the great harbour, except for a short distance near the sea, which they were still building.


7.2.4
4765
παρὰ τοσοῦτον μὲν αἱ Συράκουσαι ἦλθον κινδύνου .
For the rest of their lines, to Trogilus on the other sea, stones had already been laid for the greater part of the distance, and some points were left half finished, while others were entirely completed. To such extreme danger had Syracuse been reduced.


7.3.1
4766
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι αἰφνιδίως τοῦ τε Γυλίππου καὶ τῶν Συρακοσίων σφίσιν ἐπιόντων ἐθορυβήθησαν μὲν τὸ πρῶτον , παρετάξαντο δέ .
The Athenians, though thrown into consternation at first by the sudden attack made upon them by Gylippus and the Syracusans, quickly drew up for battle.


7.3.1
4767
ὁ δὲ θέμενος τὰ ὅπλα ἐγγὺς κήρυκα προσπέμπει αὐτοῖς λέγοντα , εἰ βούλονται ἐξιέναι ἐκ τῆς Σικελίας πέντε ἡμερῶν λαβόντες τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν , ἑτοῖμος εἶναι σπένδεσθαι .
Gylippus halted near them, and sent on a herald to tell them, that if they chose to depart from Sicily within five days, taking what belonged to them, he was ready to make a truce to that effect.


7.3.2
4768
οἱ δ’ ἐν ὀλιγωρίᾳ τε ἐποιοῦντο καὶ οὐδὲν ἀποκρινάμενοι ἀπέπεμψαν .
They, however, paid no attention to him, and sent him back again without giving any answer.


7.3.2
4769
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἀντιπαρεσκευάζοντο ἀλλήλοις ὡς ἐς μάχην .
After this, they made their preparations against each other.


7.3.3
4770
καὶ ὁ Γύλιππος ὁρῶν τοὺς Συρακοσίους ταρασσομένους καὶ οὐ ῥᾳδίως ξυντασσομένους , ἐπανῆγε τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν μᾶλλον .
And Gylippus, seeing the Syracusans in disorder and not easily falling into line, drew off his forces more into the open ground;


7.3.3
4771
καὶ ὁ Νικίας οὐκ ἐπῆγε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , ἀλλ’ ἡσύχαζε πρὸς τῷ ἑαυτῶν τείχει .
while Nicias did not lead the Athenians against them, but remained still near his own wall.


7.3.3
4772
ὡς δ’ ἔγνω ὁ Γύλιππος οὐ προσιόντας αὐτούς , ἀπήγαγε τὴν στρατιὰν ἐπὶ τὴν ἄκραν τὴν Τεμενῖτιν καλουμένην , καὶ αὐτοῦ ηὐλίσαντο .
When Gylippus found that they were not advancing, he withdrew his army to what is called the citadel of Temenites, and there they stationed themselves for the night.


7.3.4
4773
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἄγων τὴν μὲν πλείστην τῆς στρατιᾶς παρέταξε πρὸς τὰ τείχη τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὅπως μὴ ἐπιβοηθοῖεν ἄλλοσε , μέρος δέ τι πέμψας πρὸς τὸ φρούριον τὸ Λάβδαλον αἱρεῖ , καὶ ὅσους ἔλαβεν ἐν αὐτῷ πάντας ἀπέκτεινεν ·
The next day he took the greater part of his forces, and drew them up near the walls of the Athenians, to prevent their going to the relief of any other quarter, while he sent a detachment to the fort of Labdalum, and took it, and put to the sword all the men he found in it;


7.3.4
4774
ἦν δὲ οὐκ ἐπιφανὲς τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τὸ χωρίον .
the place not being within sight of the Athenians.


7.3.5
4775
καὶ τριήρης τῇ αὐτῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἁλίσκεται τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐφορμοῦσα τῷ λιμένι .
On the same day, too, a trireme of the Athenians, moored off the harbour, was taken by the Syracusans.


7.4.1
4776
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐτείχιζον οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι διὰ τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἀρξάμενοι ἄνω πρὸς τὸ ἐγκάρσιον τεῖχος ἁπλοῦν , ὅπως οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , εἰ μὴ δύναιντο κωλῦσαι , μηκέτι οἷοί τε ὦσιν ἀποτειχίσαι .
After this, the Syracusans and their allies, commencing at the city, began to build upwards along Epipolae a single wall in a cross direction, that the Athenians, if they could not stop their progress, might no longer be able to invest them.


7.4.2
4777
καὶ οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι ἀνεβεβήκεσαν ἤδη ἄνω , τὸ ἐπὶ θαλάσσῃ τεῖχος ἐπιτελέσαντες , καὶ ὁ Γύλιππος ( ἦν γάρ τι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τοῦ τείχους ἀσθενές ) νυκτὸς ἀναλαβὼν τὴν στρατιὰν ἐπῄει πρὸς αὐτό .
The Athenians had by this time gone up to the heights, after completing their wall down to the sea; and there being one weak part in the Athenian wall, Gylippus took his forces by night and made an attack upon it. When the Athenians were aware of his approach, (for they happened to be bivouacking outside,) they advanced to meet him;


7.4.3
4778
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἔτυχον γὰρ ἔξω αὐλιζόμενοι ) ὡς ᾔσθοντο , ἀντεπῇσαν ·
On observing which, he led back the troops on his side as quickly as he could.


7.4.3
4779
ὁ δὲ γνοὺς κατὰ τάχος ἀπήγαγε τοὺς σφετέρους πάλιν .
The Athenians having then raised it higher, themselves kept guard at this point,


7.4.3
4780
ἐποικοδομήσαντες δὲ αὐτὸ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὑψηλότερον αὐτοὶ μὲν ταύτῃ ἐφύλασσον , τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ξυμμάχους κατὰ τὸ ἄλλο τείχισμα ἤδη διέταξαν , ᾗπερ ἔμελλον ἕκαστοι φρουρεῖν .
and now disposed the other allies along the rest of the works as they were severally to man them.


7.4.4
4781
τῷ δὲ Νικίᾳ ἐδόκει τὸ Πλημμύριον καλούμενον τειχίσαι ·
Nicias determined also to fortify what is called Plemyrium.


7.4.4
4782
ἔστι δὲ ἄκρα ἀντιπέρας τῆς πόλεως , ἥπερ προύχουσα τοῦ μεγάλου λιμένος τὸ στόμα στενὸν ποιεῖ , καὶ εἰ τειχισθείη , ῥᾴων αὐτῷ ἐφαίνετο ἡ ἐσκομιδὴ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ἔσεσθαι ·
This is a headland opposite the city, which runs out beyond the great harbour, and narrows its mouth.


7.4.4
4783
δι’ ἐλάσσονος γὰρ πρὸς τῷ λιμένι τῷ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐφορμήσειν σφᾶς , καὶ οὐχ ὥσπερ νῦν ἐκ μυχοῦ τοῦ λιμένος τὰς ἐπαναγωγὰς ποιήσεσθαι , ἤν τι ναυτικῷ κινῶνται .
If this were fortified, he thought that the introduction of provisions would be more easily effected; as they would carry on their blockade from a less distance, near the port occupied by the Syracusans, and would not, as now, put out against them from the bottom of the great harbour, in case of their stirring at all with their fleet.


7.4.4
4784
προσεῖχέ τε ἤδη μᾶλλον τῷ κατὰ θάλασσαν πολέμῳ , ὁρῶν τὰ ἐκ τῆς γῆς σφίσιν ἤδη , ἐπειδὴ Γύλιππος ἧκεν , ἀνελπιστότερα ὄντα .
And he now paid more attention to the maritime operations of the war, seeing that their affairs by land were more hopeless since the arrival of Gylippus.


7.4.5
4785
διακομίσας οὖν στρατιὰν καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐξετείχισε τρία φρούρια ·
Having, therefore, crossed over with a body of troops and his ships, he completed the building of three forts;


7.4.5
4786
καὶ ἐν αὐτοῖς τά τε σκεύη τὰ πλεῖστα ἔκειτο καὶ τὰ πλοῖα ἤδη ἐκεῖ τὰ μεγάλα ὥρμει καὶ αἱ ταχεῖαι νῆες .
in which were deposited the greater part of the stores; the larger boats and the fast-sailing ships being now also moored there. And in consequence of this, it was chiefly at that title that the wasting of the crews first began.


7.4.6
4787
ὥστε καὶ τῶν πληρωμάτων οὐχ ἥκιστα τότε πρῶτον κάκωσις ἐγένετο ·
For as they had but a scanty supply of water, and that not close at hand;


7.4.6
4788
τῷ τε γὰρ ὕδατι σπανίῳ χρώμενοι καὶ οὐκ ἐγγύθεν , καὶ ἐπὶ φρυγανισμὸν ἅμα ὁπότε ἐξέλθοιεν οἱ ναῦται , ὑπὸ τῶν ἱππέων τῶν Συρακοσίων κρατούντων τῆς γῆς διεφθείροντο ·
and, moreover, as the sailors from time to time went out to gather firewood, they were cut off by the Syracusan horse, which had the command of the country.


7.4.6
4789
τρίτον γὰρ μέρος τῶν ἱππέων τοῖς Συρακοσίοις διὰ τοὺς ἐν τῷ Πλημμυρίῳ , ἵνα μὴ κακουργήσοντες ἐξίοιεν , ἐπὶ τῇ ἐν τῷ Ὀλυμπιείῳ πολίχνῃ ἐτετάχατο .
For a third part of their cavalry had been posted by the Syracusans in the small town in the Olympieum, with an eye to the troops on Plemyrium, to prevent their marching out to commit ravages.


7.4.7
4790
ἐπυνθάνετο δὲ καὶ τὰς λοιπὰς τῶν Κορινθίων ναῦς προσπλεούσας ὁ Νικίας ·
Meanwhile Nicias learned that the rest of the Corinthian ships also were sailing to the island,


7.4.7
4791
καὶ πέμπει ἐς φυλακὴν αὐτῶν εἴκοσι ναῦς , αἷς εἴρητο περί τε Λοκροὺς καὶ Ῥήγιον καὶ τὴν προσβολὴν τῆς Σικελίας ναυλοχεῖν αὐτάς .
and sent twenty vessels to watch for them, with orders to be on the look-out for them about Locri, Rhegium, and the approaches to Sicily.


7.5.1
4792
ὁ δὲ Γύλιππος ἅμα μὲν ἐτείχιζε τὸ διὰ τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν τεῖχος , τοῖς λίθοις χρώμενος οὓς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι προπαρεβάλοντο σφίσιν , ἅμα δὲ παρέτασσεν ἐξάγων αἰεὶ πρὸ τοῦ τειχίσματος τοὺς Συρακοσίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ·
Gylippus, on the other hand, was at once building the wall across Epipolae—making use of the stones which the Athenians before had thrown down along the line for their own use—and leading out continually the Syracusans and their allies, and drawing them up before the works;


7.5.1
4793
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀντιπαρετάσσοντο .
while the Athenians formed their line against them.


7.5.2
4794
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἔδοξε τῷ Γυλίππῳ καιρὸς εἶναι , ἦρχε τῆς ἐφόδου ·
When Gylippus thought it a favourable opportunity, he commenced the attack;


7.5.2
4795
καὶ ἐν χερσὶ γενόμενοι ἐμάχοντο μεταξὺ τῶν τειχισμάτων , ᾗ τῆς ἵππου τῶν Συρακοσίων οὐδεμία χρῆσις ἦν .
and, having closed in battle, they fought in the space between the works, where the cavalry of the Syracusans was of no use.


7.5.3
4796
καὶ νικηθέντων τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων καὶ νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀνελομένων καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων τροπαῖον στησάντων , ὁ Γύλιππος ξυγκαλέσας τὸ στράτευμα οὐκ ἔφη τὸ ἁμάρτημα ἐκείνων , ἀλλ’ ἑαυτοῦ γενέσθαι ·
When the Syracusans and their allies had thus been defeated, and had taken up their dead under truce, and after the Athenians had erected a trophy, Gylippus called his army together,


7.5.3
4797
τῆς γὰρ ἵππου καὶ τῶν ἀκοντιστῶν τὴν ὠφελίαν τῇ τάξει ἐντὸς λίαν τῶν τειχῶν ποιήσας ἀφελέσθαι ·
and said, that "the fault was not theirs, but his own; for he had deprived them of the benefit of their cavalry and dart-men by his arrangements for the battle, which he had made too far within the works:


7.5.3
4798
νῦν οὖν αὖθις ἐπάξειν .
wherefore he would now lead them again to the charge."


7.5.4
4799
καὶ διανοεῖσθαι οὕτως ἐκέλευεν αὐτοὺς ὡς τῇ μὲν παρασκευῇ οὐκ ἔλασσον ἕξοντας , τῇ δὲ γνώμῃ οὐκ ἀνεκτὸν ἐσόμενον εἰ μὴ ἀξιώσουσι Πελοποννήσιοί τε ὄντες καὶ Δωριῆς Ἰώνων καὶ νησιωτῶν καὶ ξυγκλύδων ἀνθρώπων κρατήσαντες ἐξελάσασθαι ἐκ τῆς χώρας .
" And he begged them to make up their minds to this view of the case-that they would not have the worse as regarded forces, and that with respect to resolution, it would be intolerable if they should not determine, Pelopolnnesians and Dorians as they were, to get the better of Ionians, and islanders, and a mixed rabble of men, and to drive them out of their country."


7.6.1
4800
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα , ἐπειδὴ καιρὸς ἦν , αὖθις ἐπῆγεν αὐτούς .
After this, when a favourable opportunity presented itself, he led them a second time against the enemy.


7.6.1
4801
ὁ δὲ Νικίας καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι νομίζοντες , καὶ εἰ ἐκεῖνοι μὴ ἐθέλοιεν μάχης ἄρχειν , ἀναγκαῖον εἶναι σφίσι μὴ περιορᾶν παροικοδομούμενον τὸ τεῖχος ( ἤδη γὰρ καὶ ὅσον οὐ παρεληλύθει τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων τοῦ τείχους τελευτὴν ἡ ἐκείνων τείχισις , καί , εἰ προέλθοι , τ- αὐτὸν ἤδη ἐποίει αὐτοῖς νικᾶν τε μαχομένοις διὰ παντὸς καὶ μηδὲ μάχεσθαι ) , ἀντεπῇσαν οὖν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις .
Now Nicias and the Athenians thought, that even if the Syracusane should not wish to commence an engagement, it was necessary for themselves not to permit their wall to be carried past their own: for by this time the enemy's work had all but passed the termination of the Athenian lines; and if it went on any further, it was at once all the same to them, whether they were continually fighting and victorious, or did not fight at all;


7.6.2
4802
καὶ ὁ Γύλιππος τοὺς μὲν ὁπλίτας ἔξω τῶν τειχῶν μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον προαγαγὼν ξυνέμισγεν αὐτοῖς , τοὺς δ’ ἱππέας καὶ τοὺς ἀκοντιστὰς ἐκ πλαγίου τάξας τῶν Ἀθηναίων κατὰ τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν , ᾗ τῶν τειχῶν ἀμφοτέρων αἱ ἐργασίαι ἔληγον .
Gylippus led his heavy-armed further beyond the fortifications of the two parties than before, and so engaged them, posting his cavalry and dart-men on the flank of the Athenians, in the open space where the works connected with both walls terminated.


7.6.3
4803
καὶ προσβαλόντες οἱ ἱππῆς ἐν τῇ μάχῃ τῷ εὐωνύμῳ κέρᾳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὅπερ κατ’ αὐτοὺς ἦν , ἔτρεψαν ·
During the battle, the cavalry charged the left wing of the Athenians which was opposed to them, and routed it;


7.6.3
4804
καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ καὶ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα νικηθὲν ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων κατηράχθη ἐς τὰ τειχίσματα .
and in consequence of this the rest of the army also was defeated by the Syracusans, and driven within their lines.


7.6.4
4805
καὶ τῇ ἐπιούσῃ νυκτὶ ἔφθασαν παροικοδομήσαντες καὶ παρελθόντες τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων οἰκοδομίαν , ὥστε μηκέτι μήτε αὐτοὶ κωλύεσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτῶν , ἐκείνους τε καὶ παντάπασιν ἀπεστερηκέναι , εἰ καὶ κρατοῖεν , μὴ ἂν ἔτι σφᾶς ἀποτειχίσαι .
The following night they had time to build up to the Athenian works, and to pass them; so that now they could no longer be stopped by the enemy, while they deprived  even if victorious, of all chance of investing the city in future.


7.7.1
4806
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο αἵ τε τῶν Κορινθίων νῆες καὶ Ἀμπρακιωτῶν καὶ Λευκαδίων ἐσέπλευσαν αἱ ὑπόλοιποι δώδεκα , λαθοῦσαι τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων φυλακήν ( ἦρχε δ’ αὐτῶν Ἐρασινίδης Κορίνθιος ) , καὶ ξυνετείχισαν τὸ λοιπὸν τοῖς Συρακοσίοις μέχρι τοῦ ἐγκαρσίου τείχους .
After this, the remaining twelve vessels of the Corinthians, Ambraciots, and Leucadians, having eluded the observation of the Athenian guard-force, sailed into harbour, under the command of Erasinides, a Corinthian, and joined the Syracusans in completing the remainder of their works up to the cross wall.


7.7.2
4807
καὶ ὁ Γύλιππος ἐς τὴν ἄλλην Σικελίαν ἐπὶ στρατιάν τε ᾤχετο , καὶ ναυτικὴν καὶ πεζὴν ξυλλέξων , καὶ τῶν πόλεων ἅμα προσαξόμενος εἴ τις ἢ μὴ πρόθυμος ἦν ἢ παντάπασιν ἔτι ἀφειστήκει τοῦ πολέμου .
And now Gylippus went away into the rest of Sicily for forces, intending to raise them both for sea and land service; and at the same time to bring over any of the cities that was either not hearty in the cause, or had hitherto stood entirely aloof from the war.


7.7.3
4808
πρέσβεις τε ἄλλοι τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ Κορινθίων ἐς Λακεδαίμονα καὶ Κόρινθον ἀπεστάλησαν , ὅπως στρατιὰ ἔτι περαιωθῇ τρόπῳ ᾧ ἂν ἐν ὁλκάσιν ἢ πλοίοις ἢ ἄλλως ὅπως ἂν προχωρῇ , ὡς καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπιμεταπεμπομένων .
Other ambassadors of the Syracusans and Corinthians were also sent to Lacedaemon and Corinth, in order that a fresh force might be sent over to them, in whatever way might answer best, whether in merchantmen, or boats, or any how else; since the Athenians too were sending for reinforcements.


7.7.4
4809
οἵ τε Συρακόσιοι ναυτικὸν ἐπλήρουν καὶ ἀνεπειρῶντο ὡς καὶ τούτῳ ἐπιχειρήσοντες , καὶ ἐς τ- ἄλλα πολὺ ἐπέρρωντο .
Moreover, the Syracusans proceeded to man and practise a fleet, for the purpose of making an attempt in that way also, and were in other respects much more full of confidence.


7.8.1
4810
ὁ δὲ Νικίας αἰσθόμενος τοῦτο καὶ ὁρῶν καθ’ ἡμέραν ἐπιδιδοῦσαν τήν τε τῶν πολεμίων ἰσχὺν καὶ τὴν σφετέραν ἀπορίαν , ἔπεμπε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἀγγέλλων πολλάκις μὲν καὶ ἄλλοτε καθ’ ἕκαστα τῶν γιγνομένων , μάλιστα δὲ καὶ τότε , νομίζων ἐν δεινοῖς τε εἶναι καί , εἰ μὴ ὡς τάχιστα ἢ σφᾶς μεταπέμψουσιν ἢ ἄλλους μὴ ὀλίγους ἀποστελοῦσιν , οὐδεμίαν εἶναι σωτηρίαν .
Nicias observing this, and seeing that the enemy's strength and their own difficulties were every day increasing, sent, on his side also, to Athens; having, indeed, on many other occasions sent messengers at the time of their several operations, but doing so then especially, because he thought that they were in a perilous condition, and that unless those at home recalled them as quickly as possible, or sent out no small reinforcement, there was no hope of preservation for them.


7.8.2
4811
φοβούμενος δὲ μὴ οἱ πεμπόμενοι ἢ κατὰ τὴν τοῦ λέγειν ἀδυνασίαν ἢ καὶ μνήμης ἐλλιπεῖς γιγνόμενοι ἢ τῷ ὄχλῳ πρὸς χάριν τι λέγοντες οὐ τὰ ὄντα ἀπαγγέλλωσιν , ἔγραψεν ἐπιστολήν , νομίζων οὕτως ἂν μάλιστα τὴν αὑτοῦ γνώμην μηδὲν ἐν τῷ ἀγγέλῳ ἀφανισθεῖσαν μαθόντας τοὺς Ἀθηναίους βουλεύσασθαι περὶ τῆς ἀληθείας .
Fearing, however, that those who were sent by him, either through incapacity for speaking, or through being deficient in sense, or from a wish to say something to please the multitude, should not report the real facts of the case, he wrote a letter, thinking that by this means, more than any other, the Athenians would learn his own sentiments, without their being at all obscured by the messenger, and so would deliberate on the true state of the case.


7.8.3
4812
καὶ οἱ μὲν ᾤχοντο φέροντες , οὓς ἀπέστειλε , τὰ γράμματα καὶ ὅσα ἔδει αὐτοὺς εἰπεῖν ·
Accordingly, those whom he sent departed with the letter and all that they were to say;


7.8.3
4813
ὁ δὲ τὰ κατὰ τὸ στρατόπεδον διὰ φυλακῆς μᾶλλον ἤδη ἔχων ἢ δι’ ἑκουσίων κινδύνων ἐπεμέλετο .
while he himself attended to the affairs of the armament, being engaged now in precautionary measures, rather than in perils voluntarily incurred.


7.9.1
4814
ἐν δὲ τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει τελευτῶντι καὶ Εὐετίων στρατηγὸς Ἀθηναίων μετὰ Περδίκκου στρατεύσας ἐπ’ Ἀμφίπολιν Θρᾳξὶ πολλοῖς τὴν μὲν πόλιν οὐχ εἷλεν , ἐς δὲ τὸν Στρυμόνα περικομίσας τριήρεις ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἐπολιόρκει ὁρμώμενος ἐξ Ἱμεραίου .
At the close of the same summer, Evetion, an Athenian general, having in concert with Perdiccas marched against Amphipolis with a numerous body of Thracians, did not take the city,


7.9.1
4815
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
but after bringing round some triremes into the Strymon, blockaded it from the river, making his approaches from Himeraeum. And thus the summer ended.


7.10.1
4816
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος ἥκοντες ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας οἱ παρὰ τοῦ Νικίου ὅσα τε ἀπὸ γλώσσης εἴρητο αὐτοῖς εἶπον , καὶ εἴ τίς τι ἐπηρώτα ἀπεκρίνοντο , καὶ τὴν ἐπιστολὴν ἀπέδοσαν .
The following winter, the messengers of Nicias arrived at Athens, where they stated by word of mouth what had been told them, answered whatever further question any one asked,


7.10.1
4817
ὁ δὲ γραμματεὺς ὁ τῆς πόλεως παρελθὼν ἀνέγνω τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις δηλοῦσαν τοιάδε .
and delivered the letter; which the secretary of state came forward and read to the Athenians, being to the following purport:


7.11.1
4818
&quot; τὰ μὲν πρότερον πραχθέντα , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἐν ἄλλαις πολλαῖς ἐπιστολαῖς ἴστε ·
"With our former operations, Athenians, you have been made acquainted by many other letters;


7.11.1
4819
νῦν δὲ καιρὸς οὐχ ἧσσον μαθόντας ὑμᾶς ἐν ᾧ ἐσμὲν βουλεύσασθαι .
but at present, it is especially seasonable that you should deliberate with a knowledge of the position we are in.


7.11.2
4820
κρατησάντων γὰρ ἡμῶν μάχαις ταῖς πλέοσι Συρακοσίους ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπέμφθημεν καὶ τὰ τείχη οἰκοδομησαμένων ἐν οἷσπερ νῦν ἐσμέν , ἦλθε Γύλιππος Λακεδαιμόνιος στρατιὰν ἔχων ἔκ τε Πελοποννήσου καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ πόλεων ἔστιν ὧν .
When, then, we had in many engagements defeated the Syracusans, against whom we were sent, and had built the walls in which we are now lying, Gylippus, the Lacedaemonian, came with an army from the Peloponnese and some of the cities in Sicily.


7.11.2
4821
καὶ μάχῃ τῇ μὲν πρώτῃ νικᾶται ὑφ’ ἡμῶν , τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἱππεῦσί τε πολλοῖς καὶ ἀκοντισταῖς βιασθέντες ἀνεχωρήσαμεν ἐς τὰ τείχη .
And though in the first battle he was beaten by us, in the one fought the next day we were driven from the field by numerous cavalry and dart-men, and retired within our walls.


7.11.3
4822
νῦν οὖν ἡμεῖς μὲν παυσάμενοι τοῦ περιτειχισμοῦ διὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἐναντίων ἡσυχάζομεν ( οὐδὲ γὰρ ξυμπάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ δυναίμεθ’ ἂν χρήσασθαι ἀπανηλωκυίας τῆς φυλακῆς τῶν τειχῶν μέρος τι τοῦ ὁπλιτικοῦ ) ·
At present, therefore, we have ceased working at our line of circumvallation, in consequence of the enemy's numbers, and are lying still;


7.11.3
4823
οἱ δὲ παρῳκοδομήκασιν ἡμῖν τεῖχος ἁπλοῦν , ὥστε μὴ εἶναι ἔτι περιτειχίσαι αὐτούς , ἢν μή τις τὸ παρατείχισμα τοῦτο πολλῇ στρατιᾷ ἐπελθὼν ἕλῃ .
(for we should not, indeed, be able to avail ourselves of all our force, since the guarding of our lines has exhausted a considerable part of our heavy-armed;) while they, on the other hand, have carried past us a single wall, so that it is no longer possible to invest them, unless one should assault this counter-work with a large force, and take it.


7.11.4
4824
ξυμβέβηκέ τε πολιορκεῖν δοκοῦντας ἡμᾶς ἄλλους αὐτοὺς μᾶλλον , ὅσα γε κατὰ γῆν , τοῦτο πάσχειν ·
And the consequence is, that we who are thought to be besieging others, are rather being besieged ourselves, as far as operations by land are concerned;


7.11.4
4825
οὐδὲ γὰρ τῆς χώρας ἐπὶ πολὺ διὰ τοὺς ἱππέας ἐξερχόμεθα .
for we cannot even go out far into the country because of their horse.


7.12.1
4826
&quot; πεπόμφασι δὲ καὶ ἐς Πελοπόννησον πρέσβεις ἐπ’ ἄλλην στρατιάν , καὶ ἐς τὰς ἐν Σικελίᾳ πόλεις Γύλιππος οἴχεται , τὰς μὲν καὶ πείσων ξυμπολεμεῖν ὅσαι νῦν ἡσυχάζουσιν , ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν καὶ στρατιὰν ἔτι πεζὴν καὶ ναυτικοῦ παρασκευήν , ἢν δύνηται , ἄξων .
"They have also sent ambassadors to the Peloponnese for fresh troops, and Gylippus is gone to the cities in Sicily, to persuade some of them which are at present neutral to join in the war, and to bring from others, if he can, an additional land force, as well as naval armament.


7.12.2
4827
διανοοῦνται γάρ , ὡς ἐγὼ πυνθάνομαι , τῷ τε πεζῷ ἅμα τῶν τειχῶν ἡμῶν πειρᾶν καὶ ταῖς ναυσὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν .
For they intend, as I hear, at the same time to attempt our walls with their army, and to attack us by sea with their fleet.


7.12.3
4828
καὶ δεινὸν μηδενὶ ὑμῶν δόξῃ εἶναι ὅτι καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν .
And let none of you think it strange that I say also.


7.12.3
4829
τὸ γὰρ ναυτικὸν ἡμῶν , ὅπερ κ- ἐκεῖνοι πυνθάνονται , τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἤκμαζε καὶ τῶν νεῶν τῇ ξηρότητι καὶ τῶν πληρωμάτων τῇ σωτηρίᾳ ·
For although, (as the enemy also are aware,) our fleet was at first in fine condition, as regards both the soundness of the ships and the completeness of their crews,


7.12.3
4830
νῦν δὲ αἵ τε νῆες διάβροχοι τοσοῦτον χρόνον ἤδη θαλασσεύουσαι , καὶ τὰ πληρώματα ἔφθαρται .
yet now both the ships are leaky, from having already been at sea so long a time, and the crews have been wasted;


7.12.4
4831
τὰς μὲν γὰρ ναῦς οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνελκύσαντας διαψύξαι διὰ τὸ ἀντιπάλους τῷ πλήθει καὶ ἔτι πλείους τὰς τῶν πολεμίων οὔσας αἰεὶ προσδοκίαν παρέχειν ὡς ἐπιπλεύσονται .
it being impossible to haul up and careen the vessels, because those of the enemy, being more than equal in number, are continually causing expectation of their sailing against us.


7.12.5
4832
φανεραὶ δ’ εἰσὶν ἀναπειρώμεναι , καὶ αἱ ἐπιχειρήσεις ἐπ’ ἐκείνοις καὶ ἀποξηρᾶναι τὰς σφετέρας μᾶλλον ἐξουσία ·
For they are seen practising, and it rests with them to make the attack [when they please];


7.12.5
4833
οὐ γὰρ ἐφορμοῦσιν ἄλλοις .
and they have greater facility of careening their ships, since they are not engaged in blockading others.


7.13.1
4834
ἡμῖν δ’ ἐκ πολλῆς ἂν περιουσίας νεῶν μόλις τοῦτο ὑπῆρχε καὶ μὴ ἀναγκαζομένοις ὥσπερ νῦν πάσαις φυλάσσειν ·
We, on the other hand, could scarcely enjoy this advantage, though with a great superabundance of ships, and though we were not compelled, as at present, to keep guard with all of them.


7.13.1
4835
εἰ γὰρ ἀφαιρήσομέν τι καὶ βραχὺ τῆς τηρήσεως , τὰ ἐπιτήδεια οὐχ ἕξομεν , παρὰ τὴν ἐκείνων πόλιν χαλεπῶς καὶ νῦν ἐσκομιζόμενοι .
For if we relax our watching even in a slight degree, we shall have no provisions; since even now we find difficulty in bringing them in past their city.


7.13.2
4836
τὰ δὲ πληρώματα διὰ τόδε ἐφθάρη τε ἡμῖν καὶ ἔτι νῦν φθείρεται , τῶν ναυτῶν τῶν μὲν διὰ φρυγανισμὸν καὶ ἁρπαγὴν καὶ ὑδρείαν μακρὰν ὑπὸ τῶν ἱππέων ἀπολλυμένων ·
On this account our crews have been wasted and are still wasting; as some of our seamen, in consequence of their fetching wood, of foraging, and of distant watering, are cut off by their cavalry;


7.13.2
4837
οἱ δὲ θεράποντες , ἐπειδὴ ἐς ἀντίπαλα καθεστήκαμεν , αὐτομολοῦσι , καὶ οἱ ξένοι οἱ μὲν ἀναγκαστοὶ ἐσβάντες εὐθὺς κατὰ τὰς πόλεις ἀποχωροῦσιν ,οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ μεγάλου μισθοῦ τὸ πρῶτον ἐπαρθέντες καὶ οἰόμενοι χρηματιεῖσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ μαχεῖσθαι , ἐπειδὴ παρὰ γνώμην ναυτικόν τε δὴ καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων ἀνθεστῶτα ὁρῶσιν , οἱ μὲν ἐπ’ αὐτομολίας προφάσει ἀπέρχονται , οἱ δὲ ὡς ἕκαστοι δύνανται ( πολλὴ δ’ ἡ Σικελία ) , εἰσὶ δ’ οἳ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐμπορευόμενοι ἀνδράποδα Ὑκκαρικὰ ἀντεμβιβάσαι ὑπὲρ σφῶν πείσαντες τοὺς τριηράρχους τὴν ἀκρίβειαν τοῦ ναυτικοῦ ἀφῄρηνται .
while our servants, since we have been reduced to an equal footing, desert from us, and those of the foreigners who went on board as pressed men straightway depart to the several cities; while those, again, who were at first elated by the high pay, and supposed that they were going to make money, rather than to fight, since they have unexpectedly seen both the fleet and every thing else on the side of the enemy offering resistance to us, either leave us on finding some excuse for going over to the enemy, or in whatever way they severally can, ( and Sicily is a large country;) while in some instances, by engaging in traffic themselves, after persuading the captains to take Hyccarian slaves on board in their stead, they have destroyed the perfection of our navy.


7.14.1
4838
ἐπισταμένοις δ’ ὑμῖν γράφω ὅτι βραχεῖα ἀκμὴ πληρώματος καὶ ὀλίγοι τῶν ναυτῶν οἱ ἐξορμῶντές τε ναῦν καὶ ξυνέχοντες τὴν εἰρεσίαν .
"For you, to whom I am writing, know that the flower of a crew is limited in number, and that there are but few seamen who will get a ship under weigh, or keep the rowing in time.


7.14.2
4839
τούτων δὲ πάντων ἀπορώτατον τό τε μὴ οἷόν τε εἶναι ταῦτα ἐμοὶ κωλῦσαι τῷ στρατηγῷ ( χαλεπαὶ γὰρ αἱ ὑμέτεραι φύσεις ἄρξαι ) καὶ ὅτι οὐδ’ ὁπόθεν ἐπιπληρωσόμεθα τὰς ναῦς ἔχομεν , ὃ τοῖς πολεμίοις πολλαχόθεν ὑπάρχει , ἀλλ’ ἀνάγκη ἀφ’ ὧν ἔχοντες ἤλθομεν τά τε ὄντα καὶ ἀπαναλισκόμενα γίγνεσθαι ·
But the most distressing of all these things is, that I, their general, have no power to put a stop to these abuses, (for your tempers are difficult to command,) and that we have no means of recruiting our ships' crews, (which the enemy can do from many quarters,) but both what is kept, and what is expended, must be taken from what we brought with us.


7.14.2
4840
αἱ γὰρ νῦν οὖσαι πόλεις ξύμμαχοι ἀδύνατοι Νάξος καὶ Κατάνη .
For the cities which are at present in alliance with us, namely, Naxos and Catana, are powerless.


7.14.3
4841
εἰ δὲ προσγενήσεται ἓν ἔτι τοῖς πολεμίοις , ὥστε τὰ τρέφοντα ἡμᾶς χωρία τῆς Ἰταλίας , ὁρῶντα ἐν ᾧ τ’ ἐσμὲν καὶ ὑμῶν μὴ ἐπιβοηθούντων , πρὸς ἐκείνους χωρῆσαι , διαπεπολεμήσεται αὐτοῖς ἀμαχεὶ ἐκπολιορκηθέντων ἡμῶν ὁ πόλεμος .
If, indeed, one additional advantage be still gained by the enemy, I mean, that the places in Italy which supply us with food, seeing the condition we are in, and in case of your not reinforcing us, go over to the enemy, the war will be brought to a conclusion by them without a single battle, through our being starved out.


7.14.4
4842
&quot; τούτων ἐγὼ ἡδίω μὲν ἂν εἶχον ὑμῖν ἕτερα ἐπιστέλλειν , οὐ μέντοι χρησιμώτερά γε , εἰ δεῖ σαφῶς εἰδότας τὰ ἐνθάδε βουλεύσασθαι .
I might, it is true, have had more agreeable things than these to write to you, but none more useful, if it is necessary for you to deliberate with a clear knowledge of affairs here.


7.14.4
4843
καὶ ἅμα τὰς φύσεις ἐπιστάμενος ὑμῶν , βουλομένων μὲν τὰ ἥδιστα ἀκούειν , αἰτιωμένων δὲ ὕστερον , ἤν τι ὑμῖν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν μὴ ὁμοῖον ἐκβῇ , ἀσφαλέστερον ἡγησάμην τὸ ἀληθὲς δηλῶσαι .
And besides, knowing as I do your temper, that you wish, indeed, to receive the most pleasing statements, but find fault afterwards, should any thing in consequence of them turn out different to what you expected, I thought it safer to lay the truth before you.


7.15.1
4844
καὶ νῦν ὡς ἐφ’ ἃ μὲν ἤλθομεν τὸ πρῶτον καὶ τῶν στρατιωτῶν καὶ τῶν ἡγεμόνων ὑμῖν μὴ μεμπτῶν γεγενημένων , οὕτω τὴν γνώμην ἔχετε ·
And now be assured of this, that for the business on which we first came here, neither your troops nor your generals have become inadequate:


7.15.1
4845
ἐπειδὴ δὲ Σικελία τε ἅπασα ξυνίσταται καὶ ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ἄλλη στρατιὰ προσδόκιμος αὐτοῖς , βουλεύεσθε ἤδη ὡς τῶν γ’ ἐνθάδε μηδὲ τοῖς παροῦσιν ἀνταρκούντων , ἀλλ’ ἢ τούτους μεταπέμπειν δέον ἢ ἄλλην στρατιὰν μὴ ἐλάσσω ἐπιπέμπειν καὶ πεζὴν καὶ ναυτικὴν καὶ χρήματα μὴ ὀλίγα , ἐμοὶ δὲ διάδοχόν τινα , ὡς ἀδύνατός εἰμι διὰ νόσον νεφρῖτιν παραμένειν .
but since the whole of Sicily is being united together, and a fresh force is expected by them from the Peloponnese, you must now deliberate with a conviction that your troops are not a match even for their present enemies, but that you must either recall these, or send in addition to them another armament not less numerous, both military and naval, and no small sum of money, as well as some one to succeed me, since I am unable to remain at my post in consequence of a nephritic disease.


7.15.2
4846
ἀξιῶ δ’ ὑμῶν ξυγγνώμης τυγχάνειν ·
And I think that I may claim some consideration at your hands;


7.15.2
4847
καὶ γὰρ ὅτ’ ἐρρώμην πολλὰ ἐν ἡγεμονίαις ὑμᾶς εὖ ἐποίησα .
for when I was in health, I did you much service during the periods of my command.


7.15.2
4848
ὅτι δὲ μέλλετε , ἅμα τῷ ἦρι εὐθὺς καὶ μὴ ἐς ἀναβολὰς πράσσετε , ὡς τῶν πολεμίων τὰ μὲν ἐν Σικελίᾳ δι’ ὀλίγου ποριουμένων , τὰ δ’ ἐκ Πελοποννήσου σχολαίτερον μέν , ὅμως δ’ , ἢν μὴ προσέχητε τὴν γνώμην , τὰ μὲν λήσουσιν ὑμᾶς , ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον , τὰ δὲ φθήσονται &quot; .
But whatever you mean to do, do it at the very commencement of spring, and without any delay; since the enemy will in a short time provide themselves with the succours from Sicily, and though not so quickly with those from the Peloponnese, yet if you do not pay attention to them, in some respects they will elude your observation, as before, and in others will anticipate you."


7.16.1
4849
ἡ μὲν τοῦ Νικίου ἐπιστολὴ τοσαῦτα ἐδήλου , οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀκούσαντες αὐτῆς τὸν μὲν Νικίαν οὐ παρέλυσαν τῆς ἀρχῆς , ἀλλ’ αὐτῷ , ἕως ἂν ἕτεροι ξυνάρχοντες αἱρεθέντες ἀφίκωνται , τῶν αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ δύο προσείλοντο Μένανδρον καὶ Εὐθύδημον , ὅπως μὴ μόνος ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ ταλαιπωροίη , στρατιὰν δὲ ἄλλην ἐψηφίσαντο πέμπειν καὶ ναυτικὴν καὶ πεζὴν Ἀθηναίων τε ἐκ καταλόγου καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων .
Such was the purport of Nicias's letter. The Athenians, after hearing it, did not allow him to resign his command, but till the arrival of others who were elected as his colleagues, they joined with him two of those who were there on the spot, Menander and Euthydemus, that he might not in his illness bear the labour alone; while at the same time they voted to send fresh forces, both naval and military, composed of Athenians on the muster-roll, and of their allies.


7.16.2
4850
καὶ ξυνάρχοντας αὐτῷ εἵλοντο Δημοσθένη τε τὸν Ἀλκισθένους καὶ Εὐρυμέδοντα τὸν Θουκλέους .
They also elected as his colleagues, Demosthenes son of Alcisthenes, and Eurymedon son of Thucles;


7.16.2
4851
καὶ τὸν μὲν Εὐρυμέδοντα εὐθὺς περὶ ἡλίου τροπὰς τὰς χειμερινὰς ἀποπέμπουσιν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν μετὰ δέκα νεῶν , ἄγοντα εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα ἀργυρίου , καὶ ἅμα ἀγγελοῦντα τοῖς ἐκεῖ ὅτι ἥξει βοήθεια καὶ ἐπιμέλεια αὐτῶν ἔσται ·
the latter of whom they despatched to Sicily immediately, about the winter solstice, with ten ships, a hundred and twenty talents of silver, and orders to tell the troops there that succours would come to them, and that attention would be paid to their interests.


7.17.1
4852
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης ὑπομένων παρεσκευάζετο τὸν ἔκπλουν ὡς ἅμα τῷ ἦρι ποιησόμενος , στρατιάν τε ἐπαγγέλλων ἐς τοὺς ξυμμάχους καὶ χρήματα αὐτόθεν καὶ ναῦς καὶ ὁπλίτας ἑτοιμάζων .
Demosthenes, in the mean time, stayed behind, and made preparations for the expedition, intending to start as soon as it was spring; while he sent the allies word to levy troops, and got ready at home money, ships, and heavy-armed.


7.17.2
4853
πέμπουσι δὲ καὶ περὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι εἴκοσι ναῦς , ὅπως φυλάσσοιεν μηδένα ἀπὸ Κορίνθου καὶ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν περαιοῦσθαι .
The Athenians also sent twenty ships to cruise round the Peloponnese, and to keep guard that none might cross over from Corinth and the Peloponnese to Sicily.


7.17.3
4854
οἱ γὰρ Κορίνθιοι , ὡς αὐτοῖς οἱ πρέσβεις ἧκον καὶ τὰ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ βελτίω ἤγγελλον , νομίσαντες οὐκ ἄκαιρον καὶ τὴν προτέραν πέμψιν τῶν νεῶν ποιήσασθαι , πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐπέρρωντο , καὶ ἐν ὁλκάσι παρεσκευάζοντο αὐτοί τε ἀποστελοῦντες ὁπλίτας ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν καὶ ἐκ τῆς ἄλλης Πελοποννήσου οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ πέμψοντες ·
For the Corinthians, after the ambassadors came to them, and brought a more favourable report of affairs in Sicily, thinking that they had not been unseasonable in sending their former squadron, were now much more encouraged, and prepared, on their part, to despatch heavy-armed troops for Sicily in vessels of burden, as the Lacedaemonians did likewise from the rest of the Peloponnese.


7.17.4
4855
ναῦς τε οἱ Κορίνθιοι πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν ἐπλήρουν , ὅπως ναυμαχίας τε ἀποπειράσωσι πρὸς τὴν ἐν τῇ Ναυπάκτῳ φυλακήν , καὶ τὰς ὁλκάδας αὐτῶν ἧσσον οἱ ἐν τῇ Ναυπάκτῳ Ἀθηναῖοι κωλύοιεν ἀπαίρειν , πρὸς τὴν σφετέραν ἀντίταξιν τῶν τριήρων τὴν φυλακὴν ποιούμενοι .
The Corinthians manned also five and twenty triremes, to try the result of a battle with the squadron keeping watch at Naupactus, and that the Athenians there might be less able to prevent their transports from putting out, having to keep an eye upon the Corinthian line of triremes drawn up against them.


7.18.1
4856
παρεσκευάζοντο δὲ καὶ τὴν ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐσβολὴν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι , ὥσπερ τε προυδέδοκτο αὐτοῖς καὶ τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ Κορινθίων ἐναγόντων , ἐπειδὴ ἐπυνθάνοντο τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων βοήθειαν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν , ὅπως δὴ ἐσβολῆς γενομένης διακωλυθῇ .
The Lacedaemonians prepared, too, for their invasion of Attica, both in accordance with their own previous resolution, and at the instigation of the Syracusans and Corinthians, since they had heard of the reinforcements about to be sent from Athens to Sicily;


7.18.1
4857
καὶ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης προσκείμενος ἐδίδασκε τὴν Δεκέλειαν τειχίζειν καὶ μὴ ἀνιέναι τὸν πόλεμον .
that they might be stopped by an incursion being made into the country. Alcibiades also kept urgently advising them to fortify Decelea, and not to let the war rest.


7.18.2
4858
μάλιστα δὲ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐγεγένητό τις ῥώμη , διότι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐνόμιζον διπλοῦν τὸν πόλεμον ἔχοντας , πρός τε σφᾶς καὶ Σικελιώτας , εὐκαθαιρετωτέρους ἔσεσθαι , καὶ ὅτι τὰς σπονδὰς προτέρους λελυκέναι ἡγοῦντο αὐτούς ·
But most of all had they gained confidence, because they thought that the Athenians, being engaged in a two-fold war with both themselves and the Siceliots, would be more easily subdued;


7.18.2
4859
ἐν γὰρ τῷ προτέρῳ πολέμῳ σφέτερον τὸ παρανόμημα μᾶλλον γενέσθαι , ὅτι τε ἐς Πλάταιαν ἦλθον Θηβαῖοι ἐν σπονδαῖς , καὶ εἰρημένον ἐν ταῖς πρότερον ξυνθήκαις ὅπλα μὴ ἐπιφέρειν , ἢν δίκας ἐθέλωσι διδόναι , αὐτοὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουον ἐς δίκας προκαλουμένων τῶν Ἀθηναίων .
and also because they considered them to have first broken the truce. For in the former course of hostilities they thought the guilt lay more on their own side, both because the Thebans had entered Plataea during a time of truce;


7.18.2
4860
καὶ διὰ τοῦτο εἰκότως δυστυχεῖν τε ἐνόμιζον , καὶ ἐνεθυμοῦντο τήν τε περὶ Πύλον ξυμφορὰν καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλη αὐτοῖς ἐγένετο .
and because, when it had been specified in the former treaty, that none should take up arms against others, if they were willing to submit to a judicial decision, they themselves had not listened to the Athenians when appealing to such a decision. On which account they considered that they were justly unsuccessful, and made both their misfortune at Pylus, and whatever other might have befallen them, a subject of serious reflection.


7.18.3
4861
ἐπειδὴ δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ταῖς τριάκοντα ναυσὶν ἐξ Ἄργους ὁρμώμενοι Ἐπιδαύρου τέ τι καὶ Πρασιῶν καὶ ἄλλα ἐδῄωσαν καὶ ἐκ Πύλου ἅμα ἐλῃστεύοντο , καὶ ὁσάκις περί του διαφοραὶ γένοιντο τῶν κατὰ τὰς σπονδὰς ἀμφισβητουμένων , ἐς δίκας προκαλουμένων τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων οὐκ ἤθελον ἐπιτρέπειν , τότε δὴ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι νομίσαντες τὸ παρανόμημα , ὅπερ καὶ σφίσι πρότερον ἡμάρτητο , αὖθις ἐς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τὸ αὐτὸ περιεστάναι , πρόθυμοι ἦσαν ἐς τὸν πόλεμον .
But when the Athenians had set out from Argos with those thirty ships, and ravaged a part of Epidaurus, Prasiae, and some other places, at the same time that they were also spreading devastation from Pylus; and when they refused to intrust the matter to arbitration, though the Lacedaemonians. as often as differences had arisen concerning any of the debatable points in the treaty, appealed to a judicial decision; then, indeed, the Lacedaemonians thought that the violation of the law, which in the former instance had been committed by themselves, had now, again, come in the same way to attach to the Athenians, and they were, therefore, eager for hostilities.


7.18.4
4862
καὶ ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ σίδηρόν τε περιήγγελλον κατὰ τοὺς ξυμμάχους καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐργαλεῖα ἡτοίμαζον ἐς τὸν ἐπιτειχισμόν , καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ ἅμα ὡς ἀποπέμψοντες ἐν ταῖς ὁλκάσιν ἐπικουρίαν αὐτοί τε ἐπόριζον καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους Πελοποννησίους προσηνάγκαζον .
Accordingly, during this winter they sent round to their allies orders for iron, and were getting all the tools ready for building their fort.


7.18.4
4863
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα , καὶ ὄγδοον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
At the same time they were themselves raising supplies, and compelling the rest of the Peloponnesians to do so, with a view to despatching in the merchantmen succours to those in Sicily. And so the winter ended, and the eighteenth year of this war, of which Thucydides wrote the history.


7.19.1
4864
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου ἦρος εὐθὺς ἀρχομένου πρωίτατα δὴ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐσέβαλον ·
The following spring, at its very commencement, the Lacedaemonians and their allies made a very early incursion into Attica, under the command of Agis son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians.


7.19.1
4865
ἡγεῖτο δὲ Ἆγις ὁ Ἀρχιδάμου Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς .
In the first place, then, they ravaged the parts of the country about the plain,


7.19.1
4866
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν τῆς χώρας τὰ περὶ τὸ πεδίον ἐδῄωσαν , ἔπειτα Δεκέλειαν ἐτείχιζον , κατὰ πόλεις διελόμενοι τὸ ἔργον .
and then proceeded to fortify Decelea, dividing the work amongst the contingents of the different states.


7.19.2
4867
ἀπέχει δὲ ἡ Δεκέλεια σταδίους μάλιστα τῆς τῶν Ἀθηναίων πόλεως εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατόν , παραπλήσιον δὲ καὶ οὐ πολλῷ πλέον καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Βοιωτίας .
The place is distant from the city of Athens about a hundred and twenty stades, and about the same, or not much more, from Boeotia.


7.19.2
4868
ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ πεδίῳ καὶ τῆς χώρας τοῖς κρατίστοις ἐς τὸ κακουργεῖν ᾠκοδομεῖτο τὸ τεῖχος , ἐπιφανὲς μέχρι τῆς τῶν Ἀθηναίων πόλεως .
Now the fortress was raised for the annoyance of the plain and the richest parts of the country, being visible as far as Athens.


7.19.3
4869
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐτείχιζον , οἱ δ’ ἐν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ ἀπέστελλον περὶ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον ταῖς ὁλκάσι τοὺς ὁπλίτας ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν , Λακεδαιμόνιοι μὲν τῶν τε Εἱλώτων ἐπιλεξάμενοι τοὺς βελτίστους καὶ τῶν νεοδαμωδῶν , ξυναμφοτέρων ἐς ἑξακοσίους ὁπλίτας ,καὶ Ἔκκριτον Σπαρτιάτην ἄρχοντα , Βοιωτοὶ δὲ τριακοσίους ὁπλίτας , ὧν ἦρχον Ξένων τε καὶ Νίκων Θηβαῖοι καὶ Ἡγήσανδρος Θεσπιεύς .
Thus, then, the Peloponnesians in Attica, and their allies, were engaged with their building. Those in the Peloponnese, about the same time, were sending off their heavy-armed troops to Sicily in the merchantmen, the Lacedaemonians having picked for the purpose the best of the Helots and Neodamodes, amounting both together to seven hundred, with Eccritus, a Spartan, in command of them, and the Boeotians, three hundred heavy-armed, under the command of Xeno and Nico. Thebans, and Hegesander, a Thespian.


7.19.4
4870
οὗτοι μὲν οὖν ἐν τοῖς πρῶτοι ὁρμήσαντες ἀπὸ τοῦ Ταινάρου τῆς Λακωνικῆς ἐς τὸ πέλαγος ἀφῆκαν ·
These started amongst the first from Taenarus, in Laconia, and put out into the open sea.


7.19.4
4871
μετὰ δὲ τούτους Κορίνθιοι οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον πεντακοσίους ὁπλίτας , τοὺς μὲν ἐξ αὐτῆς Κορίνθου , τοὺς δὲ προσμισθωσάμενοι Ἀρκάδων , καὶ ἄρχοντα Ἀλέξαρχον Κορίνθιον προστάξαντες ἀπέπεμψαν .
Not long after them, the Corinthians despatched five hundred heavy-armed, some from Corinth itself, and some hired from Arcadia besides, having appointed Alexarchus, a Corinthian, to the command of them.


7.19.4
4872
ἀπέστειλαν δὲ καὶ Σικυώνιοι διακοσίους ὁπλίτας ὁμοῦ τοῖς Κορινθίοις , ὧν ἦρχε Σαργεὺς Σικυώνιος .
The Sicyonians also sent off, at the same time with the Corinthians, two hundred heavy-armed under the command of Sargeus, a Sicyonian.


7.19.5
4873
αἱ δὲ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι νῆες τῶν Κορινθίων αἱ τοῦ χειμῶνος πληρωθεῖσαι ἀνθώρμουν ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ναυπάκτῳ εἴκοσιν Ἀττικαῖς , ἕωσπερ αὐτοῖς οὗτοι οἱ ὁπλῖται ταῖς ὁλκάσιν ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἀπῆραν ·
In the mean time the five and twenty ships of the Corinthians, which had been manned in the winter, were stationed in opposition to the twenty Athenian vessels at Naupactus, till they had got these heavy-armed on board the merchantmen out to sea:


7.19.5
4874
οὗπερ ἕνεκα καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἐπληρώθησαν , ὅπως μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι πρὸς τὰς ὁλκάδας μᾶλλον ἢ πρὸς τὰς τριήρεις τὸν νοῦν ἔχωσιν .
for which purpose, indeed, they had been originally manned, that the Athenians might not attend to the merchantmen so much as to the triremes.


7.20.1
4875
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἅμα τῆς Δεκελείας τῷ τειχισμῷ καὶ τοῦ ἦρος εὐθὺς ἀρχομένου περί τε Πελοπόννησον ναῦς τριάκοντα ἔστειλαν καὶ Χαρικλέα τὸν Ἀπολλοδώρου ἄρχοντα , ᾧ εἴρητο καὶ ἐς Ἄργος ἀφικομένῳ κατὰ τὸ ξυμμαχικὸν παρακαλεῖν Ἀργείων τε ὁπλίτας ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς , καὶ τὸν Δημοσθένη ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν , ὥσπερ ἔμελλον , ἀπέστελλον ἑξήκοντα μὲν ναυσὶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ πέντε Χίαις , ὁπλίταις δὲ ἐκ καταλόγου Ἀθηναίων διακοσίοις καὶ χιλίοις , καὶ νησιωτῶν ὅσοις ἑκασταχόθεν οἷόν τ’ ἦν πλείστοις χρήσασθαι , καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων τῶν ὑπηκόων , εἴ ποθέν τι εἶχον ἐπιτήδειον ἐς τὸν πόλεμον , ξυμπορίσαντες .
Meanwhile the Athenians, at the time of the fortifica tion of Decelea, and at the very commencement of the spring, sent thirty ships to cruise round the Peloponnese, under the command of Charicles son of Apollodorus, who was ordered to go to Argos also, and call for a contingent of their heavy-armed to go on board, according to the terms of their alliance.


7.20.2
4876
εἴρητο δ’ αὐτῷ πρῶτον μετὰ τοῦ Χαρικλέους ἅμα περιπλέοντα ξυστρατεύεσθαι περὶ τὴν Λακωνικήν .
Demosthenes, too, they despatched to Sicily, as they had intended, with sixty Athenian ships, and five Chian, twelve hundred Athenian heavy-armed from the muster-roll, and as many islanders as they could possibly raise from the several places; while they also supplied themselves from the other subject allies with whatever they could get in any quarter that would be of service for the war. Moreover, he was instructed, as he sailed round, to join Charicles first in his military measures on the coast of Laconia.


7.20.3
4877
καὶ ὁ μὲν Δημοσθένης ἐς τὴν Αἴγιναν προσπλεύσας τοῦ στρατεύματός τε εἴ τι ὑπελέλειπτο περιέμενε καὶ τὸν Χαρικλέα τοὺς Ἀργείους παραλαβεῖν .
So Demosthenes, after sailing to aegina, waited for any part of the armament that might have been left behind, as well as for Charicles to fetch the Argive troops.


7.21.1
4878
ἐν δὲ τῇ Σικελίᾳ ὑπὸ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τούτου τοῦ ἦρος καὶ ὁ Γύλιππος ἧκεν ἐς τὰς Συρακούσας , ἄγων ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων ὧν ἔπεισε στρατιὰν ὅσην ἑκασταχόθεν πλείστην ἐδύνατο .
In Sicily, about the same period of this spring, Gylippus came to Syracuse, bringing from the cities which he had persuaded to join him as large a number of troops as he respectively could.


7.21.2
4879
καὶ ξυγκαλέσας τοὺς Συρακοσίους ἔφη χρῆναι πληροῦν ναῦς ὡς δύνανται πλείστας καὶ ναυμαχίας ἀπόπειραν λαμβάνειν ·
And now, having called the Syracusans together, he said that they ought to man as many ships as possible, and try the experiment of a sea-fight;


7.21.2
4880
ἐλπίζειν γὰρ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ τι ἔργον ἄξιον τοῦ κινδύνου ἐς τὸν πόλεμον κατεργάσεσθαι .
for that he hoped to produce thereby a result worth the risk, towards the issue of the war.


7.21.3
4881
ξυνανέπειθε δὲ καὶ ὁ Ἑρμοκράτης οὐχ ἥκιστα , τοῦ ταῖς ναυσὶ μὴ ἀθυμεῖν ἐπιχειρῆσαι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , λέγων οὐδ’ ἐκείνους πάτριον τὴν ἐμπειρίαν οὐδ’ ἀίδιον τῆς θαλάσσης ἔχειν , ἀλλ’ ἠπειρώτας μᾶλλον τῶν Συρακοσίων ὄντας καὶ ἀναγκασθέντας ὑπὸ Μήδων ναυτικοὺς γενέσθαι .
Hermocrates, too, most earnestly joined him in trying to persuade them, in order that they might not rant courage for attacking the Athenians by sea; observing,


7.21.3
4882
καὶ πρὸς ἄνδρας τολμηρούς , οἵους καὶ Ἀθηναίους , τοὺς ἀντιτολμῶντας χαλεπωτάτους ἂν αὐτοῖς φαίνεσθαι ·
" that that people had no more than themselves enjoyed an hereditary and perpetual experience at sea, but had become a naval power after being, even more than the Syracusans, an inland one; and only because they were compelled to do so by the Medes.


7.21.3
4883
ᾧ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι τοὺς πέλας , οὐ δυνάμει ἔστιν ὅτε προύχοντες , τῷ δὲ θράσει ἐπιχειροῦντες καταφοβοῦσι , καὶ σφᾶς ἂν τὸ αὐτὸ ὁμοίως τοῖς ἐναντίοις ὑποσχεῖν .
And to men of a daring character, like the Athenians, those who were daring in opposition to them would appear most formidable: for the terror with which that people paralysed their enemies, not, in some cases, by being superior to them in power, but by attacking them with confidence, too, would in the same way strike into their opponents."


7.21.4
4884
καὶ Συρακοσίους εὖ εἰδέναι ἔφη τῷ τολμῆσαι ἀπροσδοκήτως πρὸς τὸ Ἀθηναίων ναυτικὸν ἀντιστῆναι πλέον τι διὰ τὸ τοιοῦτον ἐκπλαγέντων αὐτῶν περιγενησομένους ἢ Ἀθηναίους τῇ ἐπιστήμῃ τὴν Συρακοσίων ἀπειρίαν βλάψοντας .
And he was well assured, he said, that the Syracusans, by unexpectedly daring to offer resistance to the navy of the Athenians, would in a greater degree gain advantage from the surprise of the enemy on that account, than the Athenians by their skill would harm the unskilful Syracusans."


7.21.4
4885
ἰέναι οὖν ἐκέλευεν ἐς τὴν πεῖραν τοῦ ναυτικοῦ καὶ μὴ ἀποκνεῖν .
" And he was well assured, he said, that the Syracusans, by unexpectedly daring to offer resistance to the navy of the Athenians, would in a greater degree gain advantage from the surprise of the enemy on that account, than the Athenians by their skill would harm the unskilful Syracusans."


7.21.5
4886
καὶ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι , τοῦ τε Γυλίππου καὶ Ἑρμοκράτους καὶ εἴ του ἄλλου πειθόντων , ὥρμηντό τε ἐς τὴν ναυμαχίαν καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐπλήρουν ·
" He urged them therefore to proceed to the trial with their fleet, and not to shrink from it."  Accordingly the Syracusans, at the persuasion of Gylippus, Hermocrates, and whoever else joined them, resolved on the sea-fight, and proceeded to man their ships.


7.22.1
4887
ὁ δὲ Γύλιππος ἐπειδὴ παρεσκευάσατο τὸ ναυτικόν , ἀγαγὼν ὑπὸ νύκτα πᾶσαν τὴν στρατιὰν τὴν πεζὴν αὐτὸς μὲν τοῖς ἐν τῷ Πλημμυρίῳ τείχεσι κατὰ γῆν ἔμελλε προσβαλεῖν , αἱ δὲ τριήρεις τῶν Συρακοσίων ἅμα καὶ ἀπὸ ξυνθήματος πέντε μὲν καὶ τριάκοντα ἐκ τοῦ μεγάλου λιμένος ἐπέπλεον , αἱ δὲ πέντε καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ἐκ τοῦ ἐλάσσονος , οὗ ἦν καὶ τὸ νεώριον αὐτοῖς , καὶ περιέπλεον βουλόμενοι πρὸς τὰς ἐντὸς προσμεῖξαι καὶ ἅμα ἐπιπλεῖν τῷ Πλημμυρίῳ , ὅπως οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀμφοτέρωθεν θορυβῶνται .
When Gylippus had prepared the fleet for action, he took the whole army under cover of the night, and himself intended to assault by land the forts on Plemyrium, while at the same time, according to agreement, thirty-five of the Syracusan triremes sailed to the attack from the great harbour, and forty-five sailed round from the lesser, where their arsenal was situated; wishing to effect a junction with those within, and at the same time to sail against Plemyrium, in order that the enemy might be disconcerted by an attack on both sides.


7.22.2
4888
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι διὰ τάχους ἀντιπληρώσαντες ἑξήκοντα ναῦς ταῖς μὲν πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι πρὸς τὰς πέντε καὶ τριάκοντα τῶν Συρακοσίων τὰς ἐν τῷ μεγάλῳ λιμένι ἐναυμάχουν , ταῖς δ’ ἐπιλοίποις ἀπήντων ἐπὶ τὰς ἐκ τοῦ νεωρίου περιπλεούσας .
The Athenians, on the other hand, having with all speed manned sixty ships to oppose them, with five and twenty of them engaged the five and thirty of the Syracusans that were in the great harbour,


7.22.2
4889
καὶ εὐθὺς πρὸ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ μεγάλου λιμένος ἐναυμάχουν , καὶ ἀντεῖχον ἀλλήλοις ἐπὶ πολύ , οἱ μὲν βιάσασθαι βουλόμενοι τὸν ἔσπλουν , οἱ δὲ κωλύειν .
and with the remainder went to meet those that were sailing round from the arsenal. Thus they immediately entered into action before the mouth of the great harbour, and for a long time resisted each other, the one side wishing to force an entrance, the other being anxious to prevent them.


7.23.1
4890
ἐν τούτῳ δ’ ὁ Γύλιππος τῶν ἐν τῷ Πλημμυρίῳ Ἀθηναίων πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν ἐπικαταβάντων καὶ τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ τὴν γνώμην προσεχόντων φθάνει προσπεσὼν ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ αἰφνιδίως τοῖς τείχεσι , καὶ αἱρεῖ τὸ μέγιστον πρῶτον , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐλάσσω δύο , οὐχ ὑπομεινάντων τῶν φυλάκων , ὡς εἶδον τὸ μέγιστον ῥᾳδίως ληφθέν .
In the mean time Gylippus, when the Athenians in Plemyrium had gone down to the sea, and were paying attention to the naval engagement, surprised them by suddenly at daybreak assaulting the forts, of which he took the largest first, and then the other two; their garrisons not having awaited his attack, when they saw the largest easily carried.


7.23.2
4891
καὶ ἐκ μὲν τοῦ πρώτου ἁλόντος χαλεπῶς οἱ ἄνθρωποι , ὅσοι καὶ ἐς τὰ πλοῖα καὶ ὁλκάδα τινὰ κατέφυγον , ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐξεκομίζοντο ·
From the first that was taken the men escaped with difficulty to their camp, as many of them as took refuge in their boats and merchantmen;


7.23.2
4892
τῶν γὰρ Συρακοσίων ταῖς ἐν τῷ μεγάλῳ λιμένι ναυσὶ κρατούντων τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ ὑπὸ τριήρους μιᾶς καὶ εὖ πλεούσης ἐπεδιώκοντο ·
for as the Syracusans were getting the better in the engagement with their ships in the great harbour, the fugitives were chased by one trireme, and that a fast sailer;


7.23.2
4893
ἐπειδὴ δὲ τὰ δύο τειχίσματα ἡλίσκετο , ἐν τούτῳ καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐτύγχανον ἤδη νικώμενοι καὶ οἱ ἐξ αὐτῶν φεύγοντες ῥᾷον παρέπλευσαν .
but when the other two forts were taken, at that time the Syracusans, in their turn, were now being beaten, and so those who were flying out of the forts sailed along shore with greater ease.


7.23.3
4894
αἱ γὰρ τῶν Συρακοσίων αἱ πρὸ τοῦ στόματος νῆες ναυμαχοῦσαι βιασάμεναι τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ναῦς οὐδενὶ κόσμῳ ἐσέπλεον , καὶ ταραχθεῖσαι περὶ ἀλλήλας παρέδοσαν τὴν νίκην τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ·
For the Syracusan ships that were fighting before the mouth of the harbour, having forced their way through those of the Athenians, sailed in without any order, and being entangled with one another, transferred the victory to the Athenians;


7.23.3
4895
ταύτας τε γὰρ ἔτρεψαν καὶ ὑφ’ ὧν τὸ πρῶτον ἐνικῶντο ἐν τῷ λιμένι .
who routed both these, and those by which they were at first being defeated in the harbour.


7.23.4
4896
καὶ ἕνδεκα μὲν ναῦς τῶν Συρακοσίων κατέδυσαν , καὶ τοὺς πολλοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀπέκτειναν , πλὴν ὅσον ἐκ τριῶν νεῶν οὓς ἐζώγρησαν ·
They also sank eleven of the Syracusan ships, killing most of the men on board of them, excepting those whom they took prisoners from three vessels;


7.23.4
4897
τῶν δὲ σφετέρων τρεῖς νῆες διεφθάρησαν .
while on their own side three ships were lost.


7.23.4
4898
τὰ δὲ ναυάγια ἀνελκύσαντες τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ τροπαῖον ἐν τῷ νησιδίῳ στήσαντες τῷ πρὸ τοῦ Πλημμυρίου , ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὸ ἑαυτῶν στρατόπεδον .
After hauling up the wrecks of the Syracusans, and erecting a trophy on the small island in front of Plemyrium, they withdrew to their own encampment.


7.24.1
4899
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι κατὰ μὲν τὴν ναυμαχίαν οὕτως ἐπεπράγεσαν , τὰ δ’ ἐν τῷ Πλημμυρίῳ τείχη εἶχον , καὶ τροπαῖα ἔστησαν αὐτῶν τρία .
But although the Syracusans had thus fared with regard to the sea-fight, they were still in possession of the three forts on Plemyrium, and erected three trophies for them.


7.24.1
4900
καὶ τὸ μὲν ἕτερον τοῖν δυοῖν τειχοῖν τοῖν ὕστερον ληφθέντοιν κατέβαλον , τὰ δὲ δύο ἐπισκευάσαντες ἐφρούρουν .
One of the two forts last taken they razed, but the other two they repaired, and held with garrisons.


7.24.2
4901
ἄνθρωποι δ’ ἐν τῶν τειχῶν τῇ ἁλώσει ἀπέθανον καὶ ἐζωγρήθησαν πολλοί , καὶ χρήματα πολλὰ τὰ ξύμπαντα ἑάλω ·
In the capture of the forts many men were killed, and many made prisoners, and a large amount of property in all was taken;


7.24.2
4902
ὥσπερ γὰρ ταμιείῳ χρωμένων τῶν Ἀθηναίων τοῖς τείχεσι πολλὰ μὲν ἐμπόρων χρήματα καὶ σῖτος ἐνῆν , πολλὰ δὲ καὶ τῶν τριηράρχων , ἐπεὶ καὶ ἱστία τεσσαράκοντα τριήρων καὶ τ- ἄλλα σκεύη ἐγκατελήφθη καὶ τριήρεις ἀνειλκυσμέναι τρεῖς .
for inasmuch as the Athenians used them as a magazine, there was in them much property and corn belonging to merchants, and much also belonging to trierarchs, since there were taken in them, besides other things, masts for forty triremes, with the rest of their equipments, and also three triremes which had been drawn up on shore.


7.24.3
4903
μέγιστόν τε καὶ ἐν τοῖς πρῶτον ἐκάκωσε τὸ στράτευμα τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἡ τοῦ Πλημμυρίου λῆψις ·
Indeed, what most and principally ruined the army of the Athenians was the taking of Plemyrium;


7.24.3
4904
οὐ γὰρ ἔτι οὐδ’ οἱ ἔσπλοι ἀσφαλεῖς ἦσαν τῆς ἐπαγωγῆς τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ( οἱ γὰρ Συρακόσιοι ναυσὶν αὐτόθι ἐφορμοῦντες ἐκώλυον , καὶ διὰ μάχης ἤδη ἐγίγνοντο αἱ ἐσκομιδαί , ἔς τε τ- ἄλλα κατάπληξιν παρέσχε καὶ ἀθυμίαν τῷ στρατεύματι .
since even the entrance into the harbour was no longer secure for carrying in provisions; (for the Syracusans, blockading them at that point with their vessels, prevented it, and their getting them in was now always effected by battle;) and in other respects it struck consternation and dismay into their forces.


7.25.1
4905
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ναῦς τε ἐκπέμπουσι δώδεκα οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ Ἀγάθαρχον ἐπ’ αὐτῶν Συρακόσιον ἄρχοντα .
After this, the Syracusans sent out twelve ships, with Agatharchus, a Syracusan, on board of them as commander.


7.25.1
4906
καὶ αὐτῶν μία μὲν ἐς Πελοπόννησον ᾤχετο , πρέσβεις ἄγουσα οἵπερ τά τε σφέτερα φράσουσιν ὅτι ἐν ἐλπίσιν εἰσὶ καὶ τὸν ἐκεῖ πόλεμον ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐποτρυνοῦσι γίγνεσθαι ·
One of these went to the Peloponnese, carrying ambassadors, both to tell of their own affairs, of the hopes they were full of, and to excite them to the still more vigorous prosecution of the war in those parts.


7.25.1
4907
αἱ δ’ ἕνδεκα νῆες πρὸς τὴν Ἰταλίαν ἔπλευσαν , πυνθανόμεναι πλοῖα τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις γέμοντα χρημάτων προσπλεῖν .
The other eleven ships sailed to Italy, hearing that some vessels laden with treasure were on their way to the Athenians.


7.25.2
4908
καὶ τῶν τε πλοίων ἐπιτυχοῦσαι τὰ πολλὰ διέφθειραν καὶ ξύλα ναυπηγήσιμα ἐν τῇ Καυλωνιάτιδι κατέκαυσαν , ἃ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἑτοῖμα ἦν .
Having fallen in with these vessels, they destroyed most of their contents, and burnt a quantity of timber in the Caulonian territory, which had been got ready for the Athenians.


7.25.3
4909
ἔς τε Λοκροὺς μετὰ ταῦτα ἦλθον , καὶ ὁρμουσῶν αὐτῶν κατέπλευσε μία τῶν ὁλκάδων τῶν ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου ἄγουσα Θεσπιῶν ὁπλίτας ·
After this they came to Locri, and while lying at anchor there, one of the merchantmen from the Peloponnese put in to shore, carrying a heavy-armed band of Thespians. Having taken these on board their ships, the Syracusans coasted on homewards.


7.25.4
4910
καὶ ἀναλαβόντες αὐτοὺς οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς παρέπλεον ἐπ’ οἴκου .
The Athenians, with their twenty vessels at Megara, being on the look-out for them, took one ship with its crew;


7.25.4
4911
φυλάξαντες δ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι εἴκοσι ναυσὶ πρὸς τοῖς Μεγάροις μίαν μὲν ναῦν λαμβάνουσιν αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσι , τὰς δ’ ἄλλας οὐκ ἐδυνήθησαν , ἀλλ’ ἀποφεύγουσιν ἐς τὰς Συρακούσας .
the rest they could not overtake, but they escaped from them to Syracuse.


7.25.5
4912
ἐγένετο δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν σταυρῶν ἀκροβολισμὸς ἐν τῷ λιμένι , οὓς οἱ Συρακόσιοι πρὸ τῶν παλαιῶν νεωσοίκων κατέπηξαν ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ , ὅπως αὐτοῖς αἱ νῆες ἐντὸς ὁρμοῖεν καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπιπλέοντες μὴ βλάπτοιεν ἐμβάλλοντες .
There was also some skirmishing in the harbour about the piles which the Syracusans had driven in the sea in front of the old docks, in order that their ships might he at anchor within them, and the Athenians might not sail against them, and injure them by their charge. For the Athenians having brought up to them a ship of ten thousand talents burden, carrying wooden towers and screens, from their boats fastened ropes round the piles, and raised them with windlasses, and tore them up, or, diving down, sawed them in two.


7.25.6
4913
προσαγαγόντες γὰρ ναῦν μυριοφόρον αὐτοῖς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , πύργους τε ξυλίνους ἔχουσαν καὶ παραφράγματα , ἔκ τε τῶν ἀκάτων ὤνευον ἀναδούμενοι τοὺς σταυροὺς καὶ ἀνέκλων καὶ κατακολυμβῶντες ἐξέπριον .
The Syracusans plied their missiles on them from the docks, and the men on the ship of burden discharged theirs in return;


7.25.6
4914
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι ἀπὸ τῶν νεωσοίκων ἔβαλλον ·
and at last the Athenians removed the greater part of the piles.


7.25.6
4915
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς ὁλκάδος ἀντέβαλλον , καὶ τέλος τοὺς πολλοὺς τῶν σταυρῶν ἀνεῖλον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι .
The Syracusans plied their missiles on them from the docks, and the men on the ship of burden discharged theirs in return;


7.25.7
4916
χαλεπωτάτη δ’ ἦν τῆς σταυρώσεως ἡ κρύφιος ·
But the most dangerous part of the stockade was that out of sight:


7.25.7
4917
ἦσαν γὰρ τῶν σταυρῶν οὓς οὐχ ὑπερέχοντας τῆς θαλάσσης κατέπηξαν , ὥστε δεινὸν ἦν προσπλεῦσαι , μὴ οὐ προϊδών τις ὥσπερ περὶ ἕρμα περιβάλῃ τὴν ναῦν .
for there were some of the piles which they drove that did not rise above the surface of the sea, so that it was dangerous to approach, lest any one, through not seeing them beforehand, might strike his ship on them, as on a sunken rock.


7.25.7
4918
ἀλλὰ καὶ τούτους κολυμβηταὶ δυόμενοι ἐξέπριον μισθοῦ .
But even in the case of these divers went down and sawed them off for a reward;


7.25.7
4919
ὅμως δ’ αὖθις οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐσταύρωσαν .
but the Syracusans made, notwithstanding, a fresh stockade.


7.25.8
4920
πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα πρὸς ἀλλήλους οἷον εἰκὸς τῶν στρατοπέδων ἐγγὺς ὄντων καὶ ἀντιτεταγμένων ἐμηχανῶντο καὶ ἀκροβολισμοῖς καὶ πείραις παντοίαις ἐχρῶντο .
Many other also were the contrivances which they employed against one another, as was natural with the armaments lying near, and opposed to, each other; and they were engaged in skirmishes, and attempts of every kind.


7.25.9
4921
ἔπεμψαν δὲ καὶ ἐς τὰς πόλεις πρέσβεις οἱ Συρακόσιοι Κορινθίων καὶ Ἀμπρακιωτῶν καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων , ἀγγέλλοντας τήν τε τοῦ Πλημμυρίου λῆψιν καὶ τῆς ναυμαχίας πέρι ὡς οὐ τῇ τῶν πολεμίων ἰσχύι μᾶλλον ἢ τῇ σφετέρᾳ ταραχῇ ἡσσηθεῖεν , τά τε ἄλλα αὖ δηλώσοντας ὅτι ἐν ἐλπίσιν εἰσὶ καὶ ἀξιώσοντας ξυμβοηθεῖν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ , ὡς καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων προσδοκίμων ὄντων ἄλλῃ στρατιᾷ καί , ἢν φθάσωσιν αὐτοὶ πρότερον διαφθείραντες τὸ παρὸν στράτευμα αὐτῶν , διαπεπολεμησόμενον .
The Syracusans also sent to the cities embassies composed of Corinthians, Ambraciots, and Lacedaemonians, with tidings of the capture of Plemyrium, and to state, with regard to the sea-fight, that it was not so much by the power of the enemy as by their own confusion that they had been beaten; while, in other respects, they were to inform them that they were in good hope, and to call upon them to come to their aid, both with ships and troops; as the Athenians also were expected with a fresh force, and if they could but destroy their present armament before it came, there would be an end to the war.


7.25.9
4922
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ ταῦτα ἔπρασσον .
The parties in Sicily, then, were thus engaged.


7.26.1
4923
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης , ἐπεὶ ξυνελέγη αὐτῷ τὸ στράτευμα ὃ ἔδει ἔχοντα ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν βοηθεῖν , ἄρας ἐκ τῆς Αἰγίνης καὶ πλεύσας πρὸς τὴν Πελοπόννησον τῷ τε Χαρικλεῖ καὶ ταῖς τριάκοντα ναυσὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ξυμμίσγει , καὶ παραλαβόντες τῶν Ἀργείων ὁπλίτας ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἔπλεον ἐς τὴν Λακωνικήν ·
Demosthenes, on the other hand, when the armament had been collected by him with which he was to sail to Sicily to the aid of the force there, having put to sea from Aegina and sailed to the Peloponnese, joined Charicles and the thirty ships of the Athenians.


7.26.2
4924
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν τῆς Ἐπιδαύρου τι τῆς Λιμηρᾶς ἐδῄωσαν , ἔπειτα σχόντες ἐς τὰ καταντικρὺ Κυθήρων τῆς Λακωνικῆς , ἔνθα τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνός ἐστι , τῆς τε γῆς ἔστιν ἃ ἐδῄωσαν καὶ ἐτείχισαν ἰσθμῶδές τι χωρίον , ἵνα δὴ οἵ τε Εἵλωτες τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων αὐτόσε αὐτομολῶσι καὶ ἅμα λῃσταὶ ἐξ αὐτοῦ , ὥσπερ ἐκ τῆς Πύλου , ἁρπαγὴν ποιῶνται .
After receiving the heavy-armed troops of the Argives on board their ships, they sailed to Laconia, and in the first place ravaged a part of Epidaurus Limera. Then, landing on the coast of Laconia opposite Cythera, where stands the temple of Apollo, they fortified a certain place in the form of an isthmus, in order that the Lacedaemonian helots might desert to them there, and at the same time foraging parties might make incursions from it, as from Pylus.


7.26.3
4925
καὶ ὁ μὲν Δημοσθένης εὐθὺς ἐπειδὴ ξυγκατέλαβε τὸ χωρίον παρέπλει ἐπὶ τῆς Κερκύρας , ὅπως καὶ τῶν ἐκεῖθεν ξυμμάχων παραλαβὼν τὸν ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν πλοῦν ὅτι τάχιστα ποιῆται ·
And now, immediately after assisting to occupy this spot, Demosthenes sailed on for Corcyra, that he might take up some of the allies there also, and proceed as quickly as possible on his voyage to Sicily.


7.26.3
4926
ὁ δὲ Χαρικλῆς περιμείνας ἕως τὸ χωρίον ἐξετείχισε καὶ καταλιπὼν φυλακὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπεκομίζετο καὶ αὐτὸς ὕστερον ταῖς τριάκοντα ναυσὶν ἐπ’ οἴκου καὶ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι ἅμα .
Charicles, on the other hand, waited until he had entirely fortified the place; when, having left a garrison there, he, too, afterwards returned home with his thirty ships, and the Argives at the same time.


7.27.1
4927
ἀφίκοντο δὲ καὶ Θρᾳκῶν τῶν μαχαιροφόρων τοῦ Διακοῦ γένους ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας πελτασταὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει τούτῳ τριακόσιοι καὶ χίλιοι , οὓς ἔδει τῷ Δημοσθένει ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν ξυμπλεῖν .
There came also to Athens this same summer, to serve as targeteers, a body of Thracians who carry swords, of the tribe of the Dii, thirteen hundred in number, who were to have sailed to Sicily with Demosthenes;


7.27.2
4928
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὡς ὕστεροι ἧκον , διενοοῦντο αὐτοὺς πάλιν ὅθεν ἦλθον ἐς Θρᾴκην ἀποπέμπειν .
but as they had come too late, the Athenians determined to send them back again to Thrace, the country they had come from.


7.27.2
4929
τὸ γὰρ ἔχειν πρὸς τὸν ἐκ τῆς Δεκελείας πόλεμον αὐτοὺς πολυτελὲς ἐφαίνετο ·
For it seemed too expensive to keep them for the war carried on from Decelea.


7.27.2
4930
δραχμὴν γὰρ τῆς ἡμέρας ἕκαστος ἐλάμβανεν .
since each of them received a drachma a day.


7.27.3
4931
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἡ Δεκέλεια τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ὑπὸ πάσης τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐν τῷ θέρει τούτῳ τειχισθεῖσα , ὕστερον δὲ φρουραῖς ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων κατὰ διαδοχὴν χρόνου ἐπιούσαις τῇ χώρᾳ ἐπῳκεῖτο , πολλὰ ἔβλαπτε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , καὶ ἐν τοῖς πρῶτον χρημάτων τ’ ὀλέθρῳ καὶ ἀνθρώπων φθορᾷ ἐκάκωσε τὰ πράγματα .
For since Decelea had been first fortified by the whole Peloponnesian army during this summer, and afterwards was occupied for the annoyance of the country by garrisons coming from the states at successive periods, it greatly injured the Athenians, and was amongst the principal things that ruined their interests, both by the destruction of property and the loss of men.


7.27.4
4932
πρότερον μὲν γὰρ βραχεῖαι γιγνόμεναι αἱ ἐσβολαὶ τὸν ἄλλον χρόνον τῆς γῆς ἀπολαύειν οὐκ ἐκώλυον ·
For previously the invasions were but of brief duration, and did not prevent their enjoying their territory at other times;


7.27.4
4933
τότε δὲ ξυνεχῶς ἐπικαθημένων , καὶ ὁτὲ μὲν καὶ πλεόνων ἐπιόντων , ὁτὲ δ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης τῆς ἴσης φρουρᾶς καταθεούσης τε τὴν χώραν καὶ λῃστείας ποιουμένης , βασιλέως τε παρόντος τοῦ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων Ἄγιδος , ὃς οὐκ ἐκ παρέργου τὸν πόλεμον ἐποιεῖτο , μεγάλα οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐβλάπτοντο .
but then, when the enemy were continually stationed there for their annoyance, and sometimes attacked them with a more numerous force, while at other times the regular garrison of necessity made incursions on the land, and forayed it, Agis the Lacedaemonian king being also present, (who made no by work of the war,) the Athenians suffered severely in consequence;


7.27.5
4934
τῆς τε γὰρ χώρας ἁπάσης ἐστέρηντο , καὶ ἀνδραπόδων πλέον ἢ δύο μυριάδες ηὐτομολήκεσαν , καὶ τούτων τὸ πολὺ μέρος χειροτέχναι , πρόβατά τε πάντα ἀπωλώλει καὶ ὑποζύγια ·
for they were deprived of their whole country, and more than twenty thousand slaves had deserted, a great part of them being artisans; and all their sheep and beasts of burden were lost.


7.27.5
4935
ἵπποι τε , ὁσημέραι ἐξελαυνόντων τῶν ἱππέων πρός τε τὴν Δεκέλειαν καταδρομὰς ποιουμένων καὶ κατὰ τὴν χώραν φυλασσόντων , οἱ μὲν ἀπεχωλοῦντο ἐν γῇ ἀποκρότῳ τε καὶ ξυνεχῶς ταλαιπωροῦντες , οἱ δ’ ἐτιτρώσκοντο .
Their horses also, as the cavalry were daily on the move, making excursions to Decelea and keeping guard in the country, were either lamed by being worked on rocky ground, and that continually, or were disabled by wounds.


7.28.1
4936
ἥ τε τῶν ἐπιτηδείων παρακομιδὴ ἐκ τῆς Εὐβοίας , πρότερον ἐκ τοῦ Ὠρωποῦ κατὰ γῆν διὰ τῆς Δεκελείας θάσσων οὖσα , περὶ Σούνιον κατὰ θάλασσαν πολυτελὴς ἐγίγνετο ·
The conveyance also of provisions from Euboea, which was before effected more quickly by land from Oropus, through Decelea, was now carried on with great expense by sea, round Sunium.


7.28.1
4937
τῶν τε πάντων ὁμοίως ἐπακτῶν ἐδεῖτο ἡ πόλις , καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ πόλις εἶναι φρούριον κατέστη .
Indeed the city required every thing alike to be imported; and instead of being a city, it was reduced to a garrison.


7.28.2
4938
πρὸς γὰρ τῇ ἐπάλξει τὴν μὲν ἡμέραν κατὰ διαδοχὴν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι φυλάσσοντες , τὴν δὲ νύκτα καὶ ξύμπαντες πλὴν τῶν ἱππέων , οἱ μὲν ἐφ’ ὅπλοις † ποιούμενοι † , οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους , καὶ θέρους καὶ χειμῶνος ἐταλαιπωροῦντο .
For the Athenians were harassed by keeping guard on the fortifications, in succession by day, and all of them (excepting the cavalry) by night—some being on duty where the arms were piled, and others on the walls—both summer and winter alike. But what pressed hardest on them was, that they were engaged in two wars at once, and had arrived at such a pitch of obstinate animosity as no one would have believed, if he had heard it before it actually occurred.


7.28.3
4939
μάλιστα δ’ αὐτοὺς ἐπίεζεν ὅτι δύο πολέμους ἅμα εἶχον , καὶ ἐς φιλονικίαν καθέστασαν τοιαύτην ἣν πρὶν γενέσθαι ἠπίστησεν ἄν τις ἀκούσας .
For that even when besieged by the Peloponnesians from the fortress in their country, they should not even then have withdrawn from Sicily, but have proceeded, in their turn, to besiege Syracuse in the same manner, a city not less than Athens, considered by itself;


7.28.3
4940
τὸ γὰρ αὐτοὺς πολιορκουμένους ἐπιτειχισμῷ ὑπὸ Πελοποννησίων μηδ’ ὣς ἀποστῆναι ἐκ Σικελίας , ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖ Συρακούσας τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ ἀντιπολιορκεῖν , πόλιν οὐδὲν ἐλάσσω αὐτήν γε καθ’ αὑτὴν τῆς τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καὶ τὸν παράλογον τοσοῦτον ποιῆσαι τοῖς Ἕλλησι τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ τόλμης , ὅσον κατ’ ἀρχὰς τοῦ πολέμου οἱ μὲν ἐνιαυτόν , οἱ δὲ δύο , οἱ δὲ τριῶν γε ἐτῶν οὐδεὶς πλείω χρόνον ἐνόμιζον περιοίσειν αὐτούς , εἰ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐσβάλοιεν ἐς τὴν χώραν , ὥστε ἔτει ἑπτακαιδεκάτῳ μετὰ τὴν πρώτην ἐσβολὴν ἦλθον ἐς Σικελίαν ἤδη τῷ πολέμῳ κατὰ πάντα τετρυχωμένοι , καὶ πόλεμον οὐδὲν ἐλάσσω προσανείλοντο τοῦ πρότερον ὑπάρχοντος ἐκ Πελοποννήσου .
and that they should have exhibited to the Greeks so unexpected a display of power and daring, that whereas, in the beginning of the war, some of them thought they might hold out one year, some two, some even three, but no one longer, if the Peloponnesians should invade their country, they in the year after the first invasion, went to Sicily, when distressed by hostilities in every way, and entered upon another war besides, not less important than that which they already had with the Peloponnese, who, I say, would have believed this before it actually took place?


7.28.4
4941
δι’ ἃ καὶ τότε ὑπό τε τῆς Δεκελείας πολλὰ βλαπτούσης καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἀναλωμάτων μεγάλων προσπιπτόντων ἀδύνατοι ἐγένοντο τοῖς χρήμασιν .
It was owing to these things, then, to the great injury which Decelea inflicted on them, and the other great expenses which befell them, that they were reduced to straits for want of money;


7.28.4
4942
καὶ τὴν εἰκοστὴν ὑπὸ τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον τῶν κατὰ θάλασσαν ἀντὶ τοῦ φόρου τοῖς ὑπηκόοις ἐποίησαν , πλείω νομίζοντες ἂν σφίσι χρήματα οὕτω προσιέναι .
and it was at this time that they imposed on their subjects the tax of the twentieth on all sea-borne commodities, instead of the tribute, thinking that thus a larger amount of money would be raised by them.


7.28.4
4943
αἱ μὲν γὰρ δαπάναι οὐχ ὁμοίως καὶ πρίν , ἀλλὰ πολλῷ μείζους καθέστασαν , ὅσῳ καὶ μείζων ὁ πόλεμος ἦν ·
For their expenses were, on the one hand, not on the same scale as before, but much greater; inasmuch as the war also was greater.


7.28.4
4944
αἱ δὲ πρόσοδοι ἀπώλλυντο .
At the same time, their revenues were being destroyed.


7.29.1
4945
τοὺς οὖν Θρᾷκας τοὺς τῷ Δημοσθένει ὑστερήσαντας διὰ τὴν παροῦσαν ἀπορίαν τῶν χρημάτων οὐ βουλόμενοι δαπανᾶν εὐθὺς ἀπέπεμπον , προστάξαντες κομίσαι αὐτοὺς Διειτρέφει , καὶ εἰπόντες ἅμα ἐν τῷ παράπλῳ ( ἐπορεύοντο γὰρ δι’ Εὐρίπου ) καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους , ἤν τι δύνηται , ἀπ’ αὐτῶν βλάψαι .
These Thracians, then, who came too late for Demosthenes, as they did not, in consequence of their present want of money, wish to incur expense, they immediately sent back, having commissioned Diitrephes to convey them, and instructed him at the same time to inflict by their means whatever harm he could on the enemy during the voyage along shore, (for they were to pass through the Euripus.)


7.29.2
4946
ὁ δὲ ἔς τε τὴν Τάναγραν ἀπεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἁρπαγήν τινα ἐποιήσατο διὰ τάχους καὶ ἐκ Χαλκίδος τῆς Εὐβοίας ἀφ’ ἑσπέρας διέπλευσε τὸν Εὔριπον καὶ ἀποβιβάσας ἐς τὴν Βοιωτίαν ἦγεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ Μυκαλησσόν .
Accordingly he landed them at Tanagra, and carried off some plunder in a hurried manner; and then in the evening sailed across the Euripus from Chalcis in Euboea, and landing them in Boeotia, led them against Mycalessus.


7.29.3
4947
καὶ τὴν μὲν νύκτα λαθὼν πρὸς τῷ Ἑρμαίῳ ηὐλίσατο ( ἀπέχει δὲ τῆς Μυκαλησσοῦ ἑκκαίδεκα μάλιστα σταδίους ) , ἅμα δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ πόλει προσέκειτο οὔσῃ οὐ μεγάλῃ , καὶ αἱρεῖ ἀφυλάκτοις τε ἐπιπεσὼν καὶ ἀπροσδοκήτοις μὴ ἄν ποτέ τινας σφίσιν ἀπὸ θαλάσσης τοσοῦτον ἐπαναβάντας ἐπιθέσθαι , τοῦ τείχους ἀσθενοῦς ὄντος καὶ ἔστιν ᾗ καὶ πεπτωκότος , τοῦ δὲ βραχέος ᾠκοδομημένου , καὶ πυλῶν ἅμα διὰ τὴν ἄδειαν ἀνεῳγμένων .
During the night he bivouacked unobserved near the temple of Mercury, distant from Mycalessus about sixteen stades, and at day-break assaulted the town, which was not a large one, and took it; having fallen on the inhabitants whilst off their guard, and not expecting that any one would ever march up the country so far from the sea to attack them; their wall, too, being weak, and in some parts even fallen down, while in other parts it was built but low; and the gates, moreover, being open through their feeling of security.


7.29.4
4948
ἐσπεσόντες δὲ οἱ Θρᾷκες ἐς τὴν Μυκαλησσὸν τάς τε οἰκίας καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ ἐπόρθουν καὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἐφόνευον φειδόμενοι οὔτε πρεσβυτέρας οὔτε νεωτέρας ἡλικίας , ἀλλὰ πάντας ἑξῆς , ὅτῳ ἐντύχοιεν , καὶ παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας κτείνοντες , καὶ προσέτι καὶ ὑποζύγια καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα ἔμψυχα ἴδοιεν ·
The Thracians, then, having burst into Mycalessus, plundered both private houses and temples, and butchered the inhabitants, sparing neither old age nor youth, but killing one after another all they met with, both children and women, nay, further, even cattle and beasts of burden, and whatever other living things they saw.


7.29.4
4949
τὸ γὰρ γένος τὸ τῶν Θρᾳκῶν ὁμοῖα τοῖς μάλιστα τοῦ βαρβαρικοῦ , ἐν ᾧ ἂν θαρσήσῃ , φονικώτατόν ἐστιν .
For the Thracian race, like the most blood-thirsty of the barbarians, is most so when secure from resistance.


7.29.5
4950
καὶ τότε ἄλλη τε ταραχὴ οὐκ ὀλίγη καὶ ἰδέα πᾶσα καθειστήκει ὀλέθρου , καὶ ἐπιπεσόντες διδασκαλείῳ παίδων , ὅπερ μέγιστον ἦν αὐτόθι καὶ ἄρτι ἔτυχον οἱ παῖδες ἐσεληλυθότες , κατέκοψαν πάντας ·
And, in particular, they attacked a boys' school, the largest there was in the place, (which the children had just entered,) and cut them all to pieces.


7.29.5
4951
καὶ ξυμφορὰ τῇ πόλει πάσῃ οὐδεμιᾶς ἥσσων μᾶλλον ἑτέρας ἀδόκητός τε ἐπέπεσεν αὕτη καὶ δεινή .
And this disaster, which fell on the whole town, was inferior to none in extent, while it was more unexpected and shocking than any other.


7.30.1
4952
οἱ δὲ Θηβαῖοι αἰσθόμενοι ἐβοήθουν , καὶ καταλαβόντες προκεχωρηκότας ἤδη τοὺς Θρᾷκας οὐ πολὺ τήν τε λείαν ἀφείλοντο καὶ αὐτοὺς φοβήσαντες καταδιώκουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν Εὔριπον καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν , οὗ αὐτοῖς τὰ πλοῖα ἃ ἤγαγεν ὥρμει .
When the Thebans were aware of it, they marched to the rescue; and having overtaken the Thracians when they had not at present advanced any great distance, they both recovered their plundered property, and having struck them with panic pursued them down to the sea, where their boats which conveyed them were lying at anchor.


7.30.2
4953
καὶ ἀποκτείνουσιν αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ἐσβάσει τοὺς πλείστους οὔτε ἐπισταμένους νεῖν τῶν τε ἐν τοῖς πλοίοις , ὡς ἑώρων τὰ ἐν τῇ γῇ , ὁρμισάντων ἔξω τοξεύματος τὰ πλοῖα , ἐπεὶ ἔν γε τῇ ἄλλῃ ἀναχωρήσει οὐκ ἀτόπως οἱ Θρᾷκες πρὸς τὸ τῶν Θηβαίων ἱππικόν , ὅπερ πρῶτον προσέκειτο , προεκθέοντές τε καὶ ξυστρεφόμενοι ἐν ἐπιχωρίῳ τάξει τὴν φυλακὴν ἐποιοῦντο , καὶ ὀλίγοι αὐτῶν ἐν τούτῳ διεφθάρησαν .
And they slew the greatest part of them during their embarkation, as they could not swim, and as those on board the boats, on seeing what was going on ashore, moored them out of bow-shot.


7.30.2
4954
μέρος δέ τι καὶ ἐν τῇ πόλει αὐτῇ δι’ ἁρπαγὴν ἐγκαταληφθὲν ἀπώλετο .
For in the rest of the retreat the Thracians advanced in no contemptible manner to meet the Theban horse, which first fell upon them; and closing their ranks, according to their native tactics, defended themselves against them; and thus only a few were killed in that part of the affair.


7.30.2
4955
οἱ δὲ ξύμπαντες τῶν Θρᾳκῶν πεντήκοντα καὶ διακόσιοι ἀπὸ τριακοσίων καὶ χιλίων ἀπέθανον .
Some portion of them also were surprised in the city, through their eagerness in plundering, and perished. Altogether, there fell of the Thracians two hundred and fifty out of thirteen hundred;


7.30.3
4956
διέφθειραν δὲ καὶ τῶν Θηβαίων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων οἳ ξυνεβοήθησαν ἐς εἴκοσι μάλιστα ἱππέας τε καὶ ὁπλίτας ὁμοῦ καὶ Θηβαίων τῶν βοιωταρχῶν Σκιρφώνδαν ·
while of the Thebans and the rest who joined in attacking them they slew about twenty, horse and foot together, and amongst the Thebans, Scirphondas, one of the Boeotarchs.


7.30.3
4957
τῶν δὲ Μυκαλησσίων μέρος τι ἀπανηλώθη .
On the side of the Mycalessians a considerable part of the population was cut off.


7.30.3
4958
τὰ μὲν κατὰ τὴν Μυκαλησσὸν πάθει χρησαμένην οὐδενὸς ὡς ἐπὶ μεγέθει τῶν κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἧσσον ὀλοφύρασθαι ἀξίῳ τοιαῦτα ξυνέβη .
With regard, then, to Mycalessus, which experienced, considering its extent, a calamity not less lamentable than any which happened in the war, such were the things which occurred there.


7.31.1
4959
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης τότε ἀποπλέων ἐπὶ τῆς Κερκύρας μετὰ τὴν ἐκ τῆς Λακωνικῆς τείχισιν , ὁλκάδα ὁρμοῦσαν ἐν Φειᾷ τῇ Ἠλείων εὑρών , ἐν ᾗ οἱ Κορίνθιοι ὁπλῖται ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν ἔμελλον περαιοῦσθαι , αὐτὴν μὲν διαφθείρει , οἱ δ’ ἄνδρες ἀποφυγόντες ὕστερον λαβόντες ἄλλην ἔπλεον .
Now Demosthenes being at that time on his voyage for Corcyra, after he had built the fortifications on the side of Laconia, fell in with a merchant vessel anchored at Phea in the Elean territory, in which the Corinthian heavy-armed were to cross over to Sicily;


7.31.2
4960
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἀφικόμενος ὁ Δημοσθένης ἐς τὴν Ζάκυνθον καὶ Κεφαλληνίαν ὁπλίτας τε παρέλαβε καὶ ἐκ τῆς Ναυπάκτου τῶν Μεσσηνίων μετεπέμψατο καὶ ἐς τὴν ἀντιπέρας ἤπειρον τῆς Ἀκαρνανίας διέβη , ἐς Ἀλύζιάν τε καὶ Ἀνακτόριον , ὃ αὐτοὶ εἶχον .
and he destroyed the ship itself, but the men escaped from it, and having subsequently got another, proceeded on their voyage. After this, having come to Zacynthus and Cephallenia, he took on board a body of heavy-armed, sent for some of the Messenians from Naupactus, and then crossed over to the opposite coast of Acarnania, on the continent, to Alyzia and Anactorium, which the Athenians had in their own hands.


7.31.3
4961
ὄντι δ’ αὐτῷ περὶ ταῦτα ὁ Εὐρυμέδων ἀπαντᾷ ἐκ τῆς Σικελίας ἀποπλέων , ὃς τότε τοῦ χειμῶνος τὰ χρήματα ἄγων τῇ στρατιᾷ ἀπεπέμφθη , καὶ ἀγγέλλει τά τε ἄλλα καὶ ὅτι πύθοιτο κατὰ πλοῦν ἤδη ὢν τὸ Πλημμύριον ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἑαλωκός .
While he was in these parts, he was met by Eurymedon returning from Sicily; who had been sent out with treasure at the time that has been mentioned, during the winter, and told him, amongst other tidings, that he had heard, when already on his voyage, that Plemyrium had been taken by the Syracusans.


7.31.4
4962
ἀφικνεῖται δὲ καὶ Κόνων παρ’ αὐτούς , ὃς ἦρχε Ναυπάκτου , ἀγγέλλων ὅτι αἱ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι νῆες τῶν Κορινθίων αἱ σφίσιν ἀνθορμοῦσαι οὔτε καταλύουσι τὸν πόλεμον ναυμαχεῖν τε μέλλουσιν ·
Conon, too, who was in command at Naupactus, came to them, with information that the five and twenty Corinthian ships stationed opposite to the Athenian squadron did not give up hostilities, but were prepared for an engagement.


7.31.4
4963
πέμπειν οὖν ἐκέλευεν αὐτοὺς ναῦς , ὡς οὐχ ἱκανὰς οὔσας δυοῖν δεούσας εἴκοσι τὰς ἑαυτῶν πρὸς τὰς ἐκείνων πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι ναυμαχεῖν .
He begged them therefore to send him some ships, as his own eighteen were not competent to fight the enemy's five and twenty.


7.31.5
4964
τῷ μὲν οὖν Κόνωνι δέκα ναῦς ὁ Δημοσθένης καὶ ὁ Εὐρυμέδων τὰς ἄριστα σφίσι πλεούσας ἀφ’ ὧν αὐτοὶ εἶχον ξυμπέμπουσι πρὸς τὰς ἐν τῇ Ναυπάκτῳ ·
Accordingly Demosthenes and Eurymedon sent with Conon the ten best sailers of all they had, to join those at Naupactus.


7.31.5
4965
αὐτοὶ δὲ τὰ περὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς τὸν ξύλλογον ἡτοιμάζοντο , Εὐρυμέδων μὲν ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν πλεύσας καὶ πέντε καὶ δέκα τε ναῦς πληροῦν κελεύσας αὐτοὺς καὶ ὁπλίτας καταλεγόμενος ( ξυνῆρχε γὰρ ἤδη Δημοσθένει ἀποτραπόμενος , ὥσπερ καὶ ᾑρέθη ) , Δημοσθένης δ’ ἐκ τῶν περὶ τὴν Ἀκαρνανίαν χωρίων σφενδονήτας τε καὶ ἀκοντιστὰς ξυναγείρων .
They themselves at the same time made preparations for the muster of their forces, Eurymedon sailing to Corcyra, urging them to man fifteen ships, and enlisting heavy-armed troops, (for he now shared the command with Demosthenes, and had turned back again, in consequence of his election,) and Demosthenes raising slingers and dart-men from the parts about Acarnania.


7.32.1
4966
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῶν Συρακουσῶν τότε μετὰ τὴν τοῦ Πλημμυρίου ἅλωσιν πρέσβεις οἰχόμενοι ἐς τὰς πόλεις ἐπειδὴ ἔπεισάν τε καὶ ξυναγείραντες ἔμελλον ἄξειν τὸν στρατόν , ὁ Νικίας προπυθόμενος πέμπει ἐς τῶν Σικελῶν τοὺς τὴν δίοδον ἔχοντας καὶ σφίσι ξυμμάχους , Κεντόριπάς τε καὶ Ἀλικυαίους καὶ ἄλλους , ὅπως μὴ διαφρήσωσι τοὺς πολεμίους , ἀλλὰ ξυστραφέντες κωλύσωσι διελθεῖν ·
As for the ambassadors who had gone at the time mentioned-after the taking of Plemyrium-from Syracuse to the cities, they had prevailed on them to join their side, and had raised and were just about to lead off the force, when Nicias, receiving early intelligence of it, sent to those of the Sicels who held the passes, and were in alliance with the Athenians, namely, the Centotripes, Alicyaeans, and some others, to beg them not to give free passage to the enemy, but to unite together and prevent their marching through their country.


7.32.1
4967
ἄλλῃ γὰρ αὐτοὺς οὐδὲ πειράσειν ·
For there was no other by which they would attempt to do so.


7.32.1
4968
Ἀκραγαντῖνοι γὰρ οὐκ ἐδίδοσαν διὰ τῆς ἑαυτῶν ὁδόν .
The reason was that the Acragantines would not grant them a passage through theirs.


7.32.2
4969
πορευομένων δ’ ἤδη τῶν Σικελιωτῶν οἱ Σικελοί , καθάπερ ἐδέοντο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἐνέδραν τινὰ τριχῇ ποιησάμενοι , ἀφυλάκτοις τε καὶ ἐξαίφνης ἐπιγενόμενοι διέφθειραν ἐς ὀκτακοσίους μάλιστα καὶ τοὺς πρέσβεις πλὴν ἑνὸς τοῦ Κορινθίου πάντας ·
When therefore the Siceliots were even on their march, the Sicels, in compliance with the request of the Athenians, laid an ambuscade for them in three different places, and falling upon them while off their guard and without any notice, killed about eight hundred of them, with all the ambassadors except one, namely, the Corinthian.


7.32.2
4970
οὗτος δὲ τοὺς διαφυγόντας ἐς πεντακοσίους καὶ χιλίους ἐκόμισεν ἐς τὰς Συρακούσας .
This man led to Syracuse those that had escaped, to the number of fifteen hundred.


7.33.1
4971
καὶ περὶ τὰς αὐτὰς ἡμέρας καὶ οἱ Καμαριναῖοι ἀφικνοῦνται αὐτοῖς βοηθοῦντες , πεντακόσιοι μὲν ὁπλῖται , τριακόσιοι δὲ ἀκοντισταὶ καὶ τοξόται τριακόσιοι .
About that same time the Camarinaeans also came to their help with five hundred heavy-armed, three hundred dartmen, and three hundred bow-men.


7.33.1
4972
ἔπεμψαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Γελῷοι ναυτικόν τε ἐς πέντε ναῦς καὶ ἀκοντιστὰς τετρακοσίους καὶ ἱππέας διακοσίους .
The Geloans, too, sent a squadron of five ships, four hundred dart-men, and two hundred horse.


7.33.2
4973
σχεδὸν γάρ τι ἤδη πᾶσα ἡ Σικελία πλὴν Ἀκραγαντίνων ( οὗτοι δ’ οὐδὲ μεθ’ ἑτέρων ἦσαν ) , οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μετὰ τῶν Συρακοσίων οἱ πρότερον περιορώμενοι ξυστάντες ἐβοήθουν .
For by this time pretty nearly the whole of Sicily—excepting the Acragantines, who were neutral—the rest, I say, who before had waited to see the result of events, now united with the Syracusans, and assisted them against the Athenians.


7.33.3
4974
καὶ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι , ὡς αὐτοῖς τὸ ἐν τοῖς Σικελοῖς πάθος ἐγένετο , ἐπέσχον τὸ εὐθέως τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐπιχειρεῖν ·
The Syracusans, then, after the disaster in the Sicel country had befallen them, ceased for the present from attacking the Athenians.


7.33.3
4975
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης καὶ Εὐρυμέδων , ἑτοίμης ἤδη τῆς στρατιᾶς οὔσης ἔκ τε τῆς Κερκύρας καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἠπείρου , ἐπεραιώθησαν ξυμπάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ τὸν Ἰόνιον ἐπ’ ἄκραν Ἰαπυγίαν ·
Demosthenes and Eurymedon, on the other hand, their forces being now ready both from Corcyra and the continent, crossed the Ionian gulf with all their army to the Iapygian foreland.


7.33.4
4976
καὶ ὁρμηθέντες αὐτόθεν κατίσχουσιν ἐς τὰς Χοιράδας νήσους Ἰαπυγίας , καὶ ἀκοντιστάς τέ τινας τῶν Ἰαπύγων πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν τοῦ Μεσσαπίου ἔθνους ἀναβιβάζονται ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς , καὶ τῷ Ἄρτᾳ , ὅσπερ καὶ τοὺς ἀκοντιστὰς δυνάστης ὢν παρέσχετο αὐτοῖς , ἀνανεωσάμενοί τινα παλαιὰν φιλίαν ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς Μεταπόντιον τῆς Ἰταλίας .
and after renewing an old friendship with Artas, who also had provided them with the dart-men, being one of their chieftains, they arrived at Metapontum in Italy. After persuading the Metapontines to send with them, on the strength of their alliance, three hundred dart-men and two triremes, with this addition to their armament they coasted along to Thuria.


7.33.5
4977
καὶ τοὺς Μεταποντίους πείσαντες κατὰ τὸ ξυμμαχικὸν ἀκοντιστάς τε ξυμπέμπειν τριακοσίους καὶ τριήρεις δύο καὶ ἀναλαβόντες ταῦτα παρέπλευσαν ἐς Θουρίαν .
Starting thence, they touched at the Choerades islands, lying off Iapygia, and took on board their ships some Iapygian dart-men, one hundred and fifty in number, of the Messapian tribe;


7.33.5
4978
καὶ καταλαμβάνουσι νεωστὶ στάσει τοὺς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐναντίους ἐκπεπτωκότας ·
There they found the opponents of the Athenians recently expelled in consequence of a sedition.


7.33.6
4979
καὶ βουλόμενοι τὴν στρατιὰν αὐτόθι πᾶσαν ἁθροίσαντες εἴ τις ὑπελέλειπτο ἐξετάσαι , καὶ τοὺς Θουρίους πεῖσαι σφίσι ξυστρατεύειν τε ὡς προθυμότατα καί , ἐπειδήπερ ἐν τούτῳ τύχης εἰσί , τοὺς αὐτοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ φίλους τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις νομίζειν , περιέμενον ἐν τῇ Θουρίᾳ καὶ ἔπρασσον ταῦτα .
And as they wished to muster there the whole army, in case any part had been left behind, and to review it, as well as to persuade the Thurians to join them as zealously as possible in the expedition, and to have considering their present position, the same foes and friends as the Athenians, they waited awhile in Thuria, and were prosecuting these designs.


7.34.1
4980
οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι περὶ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον τοῦτον οἱ ἐν ταῖς πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι ναυσίν , οἵπερ τῶν ὁλκάδων ἕνεκα τῆς ἐς Σικελίαν κομιδῆς ἀνθώρμουν πρὸς τὰς ἐν Ναυπάκτῳ ναῦς , παρασκευασάμενοι ὡς ἐπὶ ναυμαχίᾳ καὶ προσπληρώσαντες ἔτι ναῦς ὥστε ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους εἶναι αὐτοῖς τῶν Ἀττικῶν νεῶν , ὁρμίζονται κατὰ Ἐρινεὸν τῆς Ἀχαΐας ἐν τῇ Ῥυπικῇ .
About the same time, the Peloponnesians in the five and twenty ships, who, to secure the passage of the merchantmen to Sicily, were anchored over against the fleet at Naupactus, having made their preparations for a sea-fight, and having manned some additional ships, so that they were now but little inferior to the Athenian force, stationed themselves off Erineus in Achae, in the territory of Rhypa.


7.34.2
4981
καὶ αὐτοῖς τοῦ χωρίου μηνοειδοῦς ὄντος ἐφ’ ᾧ ὥρμουν , ὁ μὲν πεζὸς ἑκατέρωθεν προσβεβοηθηκὼς τῶν τε Κορινθίων καὶ τῶν αὐτόθεν ξυμμάχων ἐπὶ ταῖς προανεχούσαις ἄκραις παρετέτακτο , αἱ δὲ νῆες τὸ μεταξὺ εἶχον ἐμφάρξασαι ·
And the place in which they were stationed being in the form of a crescent, their land forces which had come to their assistance from the Corinthians, and from their allies on the spot, were ranged on the projecting headlands on both sides;


7.34.2
4982
ἦρχε δὲ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ Πολυάνθης Κορίνθιος .
while the ships occupied the intervening space, blocking up the entrance. The commander of the fleet was Polyanthes, a Corinthian.


7.34.3
4983
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐκ τῆς Ναυπάκτου τριάκοντα ναυσὶ καὶ τρισίν ( ἦρχε δὲ αὐτῶν Δίφιλος ) ἐπέπλευσαν αὐτοῖς .
The Athenians sailed out against them from Naupactus with three and thirty ships, under the command of Diphilus.


7.34.4
4984
καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἡσύχαζον , ἔπειτα ἀρθέντος αὐτοῖς τοῦ σημείου , ἐπεὶ καιρὸς ἐδόκει εἶναι , ὥρμησαν ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ ἐναυμάχουν .
The Corinthians at first remained stationary, but afterwards, having raised their signal for battle, when there appeared to be a favourable opportunity, they advanced upon the Athenians, and engaged them.


7.34.4
4985
καὶ χρόνον ἀντεῖχον πολὺν ἀλλήλοις .
For a long time they resisted each other;


7.34.5
4986
καὶ τῶν μὲν Κορινθίων τρεῖς νῆες διαφθείρονται , τῶν δ’ Ἀθηναίων κατέδυ μὲν οὐδεμία ἁπλῶς , ἑπτὰ δέ τινες ἄπλοι ἐγένοντο ἀντίπρῳροι ἐμβαλλόμεναι καὶ ἀναρραγεῖσαι τὰς παρεξειρεσίας ὑπὸ τῶν Κορινθίων νεῶν ἐπ’ αὐτὸ τοῦτο παχυτέρας τὰς ἐπωτίδας ἐχουσῶν .
at length three ships on the side of the Corinthians were destroyed, while on that of the Athenians none was absolutely sunk, but some seven were disabled, being struck prow to prow, and having their foreships stove in by the Corinthian vessels, which were provided with stronger cheeks than usual for this very purpose.


7.34.6
4987
ναυμαχήσαντες δὲ ἀντίπαλα μὲν καὶ ὡς αὐτοὺς ἑκατέρους ἀξιοῦν νικᾶν , ὅμως δὲ τῶν ναυαγίων κρατησάντων τῶν Ἀθηναίων διά τε τὴν τοῦ ἀνέμου ἄπωσιν αὐτῶν ἐς τὸ πέλαγος καὶ διὰ τὴν τῶν Κορινθίων οὐκέτι ἐπαναγωγήν , διεκρίθησαν ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων , καὶ δίωξις οὐδεμία ἐγένετο , οὐδ’ ἄνδρες οὐδετέρων ἑάλωσαν ·
After fighting on equal terms, so that either party might claim the victory, (though the Athenians, nevertheless, had got possession of the wrecks, through the wind driving them out into the open sea, and the Corinthians no longer advancing against them,) they separated from each other, and there was no pursuit made, nor were any prisoners taken on either side:


7.34.6
4988
οἱ μὲν γὰρ Κορίνθιοι καὶ Πελοποννήσιοι πρὸς τῇ γῇ ναυμαχοῦντες ῥᾳδίως διεσῴζοντο , τῶν δὲ Ἀθηναίων οὐδεμία κατέδυ ναῦς .
for the Corinthians and Peloponnesians easily effected their escape, as they were fighting near shore, and no ship on the side of the Athenians went down.


7.34.7
4989
ἀποπλευσάντων δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐς τὴν Ναύπακτον οἱ Κορίνθιοι εὐθὺς τροπαῖον ἔστησαν ὡς νικῶντες , ὅτι πλείους τῶν ἐναντίων ναῦς ἄπλους ἐποίησαν καὶ νομίσαντες αὐτοὶ οὐχ ἡσσᾶσθαι δι’ ὅπερ οὐδ’ οἱ ἕτεροι νικᾶν ·
When, however, the Athenians had sailed back to Naupactus, the Corinthians immediately erected a trophy, as conquerors; because they had disabled a greater number of their enemy's ships, and considered that they were not beaten, for the very same reason that the other party considered them not to have conquered:


7.34.7
4990
οἵ τε γὰρ Κορίνθιοι ἡγήσαντο κρατεῖν εἰ μὴ καὶ πολὺ ἐκρατοῦντο , οἵ τ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐνόμιζον ἡσσᾶσθαι ὅτι οὐ πολὺ ἐνίκων .
for the Corinthians regarded themselves as having the advantage if they were not decidedly beaten, and the Athenians considered them to be worsted, because they were not decidedly conquerors.


7.34.8
4991
ἀποπλευσάντων δὲ τῶν Πελοποννησίων καὶ τοῦ πεζοῦ διαλυθέντος οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔστησαν τροπαῖον καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐν τῇ Ἀχαΐᾳ ὡς νικήσαντες ,ἀπέχον τοῦ Ἐρινεοῦ , ἐν ᾧ οἱ Κορίνθιοι ὥρμουν , ὡς εἴκοσι σταδίους .
But when the Peloponnesians had sailed off, and their troops had dispersed, the Athenians erected a trophy on their side also, as having gained the victory, in Achaea, at about twenty stades distance from Erineus, where the Corinthians were stationed.


7.34.8
4992
καὶ ἡ μὲν ναυμαχία οὕτως ἐτελεύτα .
And so ended the sea-fight.


7.35.1
4993
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης καὶ Εὐρυμέδων , ἐπειδὴ ξυστρατεύειν αὐτοῖς οἱ Θούριοι παρεσκευάσθησαν ἑπτακοσίοις μὲν ὁπλίταις , τριακοσίοις δὲ ἀκοντισταῖς , τὰς μὲν ναῦς παραπλεῖν ἐκέλευον ἐπὶ τῆς Κροτωνιάτιδος , αὐτοὶ δὲ τὸν πεζὸν πάντα ἐξετάσαντες πρῶτον ἐπὶ τῷ Συβάρει ποταμῷ ἦγον διὰ τῆς Θουριάδος γῆς .
Now Demosthenes and Eurymedon, when the Thurians were prepared to join them in the expedition with seven hundred heavy-armed and three hundred dart-men, gave orders for the ships to coast along towards the Crotonian territory; while they themselves, having first reviewed all the land forces on the river Sybaris, proceeded to lead them through the Thurian country.


7.35.2
4994
καὶ ὡς ἐγένοντο ἐπὶ τῷ Ὑλίᾳ ποταμῷ καὶ αὐτοῖς οἱ Κροτωνιᾶται προσπέμψαντες εἶπον οὐκ ἂν σφίσι βουλομένοις εἶναι διὰ τῆς γῆς σφῶν τὸν στρατὸν ἰέναι , ἐπικαταβάντες ηὐλίσαντο πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ τὴν ἐκβολὴν τοῦ Ὑλίου ·
When they were on the banks of the river Hylias, and the Crotonians sent to them, and said that they should not choose the army to pass through their territory, they descended towards the shore, and encamped for the night by the sea, at the mouth of the Hylias.


7.35.2
4995
καὶ αἱ νῆες αὐτοῖς ἐς τὸ αὐτὸ ἀπήντων .
Their ships also met them at the same point.


7.35.2
4996
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἀναβιβασάμενοι παρέπλεον , ἴσχοντες πρὸς ταῖς πόλεσι πλὴν Λοκρῶν , ἕως ἀφίκοντο ἐπὶ Πέτραν τῆς Ῥηγίνης .
The following day, having put their men on board, they coasted along, touching at all the cities, excepting Locri, until they came to Petra in the Rhegian territory.


7.36.1
4997
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι ἐν τούτῳ πυνθανόμενοι αὐτῶν τὸν ἐπίπλουν αὖθις ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀποπειρᾶσαι ἐβούλοντο καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ παρασκευῇ τοῦ πεζοῦ , ἥνπερ ἐπ’ αὐτὸ τοῦτο πρὶν ἐλθεῖν αὐτοὺς φθάσαι βουλόμενοι ξυνέλεγον .
The Syracusans, in the mean time, hearing of their approach, wished to make a second attempt with their fleet and other forces on shore, which they were collecting for this very object, being desirous of striking a blow before they came.


7.36.2
4998
παρεσκευάσαντο δὲ τό τε ἄλλο ναυτικὸν ὡς ἐκ τῆς προτέρας ναυμαχίας τι πλέον ἐνεῖδον σχήσοντες , καὶ τὰς πρῴρας τῶν νεῶν ξυντεμόντες ἐς ἔλασσον στεριφωτέρας ἐποίησαν , καὶ τὰς ἐπωτίδας ἐπέθεσαν ταῖς πρῴραις παχείας , καὶ ἀντηρίδας ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὑπέτειναν πρὸς τοὺς τοίχους ὡς ἐπὶ ἓξ πήχεις ἐντός τε καὶ ἔξωθεν ·
Now they had equipped the rest of their navy according as they saw, from the result of the former sea-fight, that they would obtain any advantage; and having cut down their ships' prows into a less compass, they made them firmer than usual, by fixing stout cheeks to them, and attaching stays from these to the ships' sides, for the length of six cubits both inside and outside the vessel;


7.36.2
4999
ᾧπερ τρόπῳ καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι πρὸς τὰς ἐν τῇ Ναυπάκτῳ ναῦς ἐπισκευασάμενοι πρῴραθεν ἐναυμάχουν .
in the very same way as the Corinthians had equipped their ships ahead against the squadron at Naupactus, and then proceeded to engage it.


7.36.3
5000
ἐνόμισαν γὰρ οἱ Συρακόσιοι πρὸς τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ναῦς οὐχ ὁμοίως ἀντινεναυπηγημένας , ἀλλὰ λεπτὰ τὰ πρῴραθεν ἐχούσας διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀντιπρῴροις μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς ἢ ἐκ περίπλου ταῖς ἐμβολαῖς χρῆσθαι , οὐκ ἔλασσον σχήσειν , καὶ τὴν ἐν τῷ μεγάλῳ λιμένι ναυμαχίαν , οὐκ ἐν πολλῷ πολλαῖς ναυσὶν οὖσαν , πρὸς ἑαυτῶν ἔσεσθαι ·
For the Syracusans thought that in this way they would have an advantage against the Athenian vessels, which were not in the same manner built to resist them, but were slight ahead, (because they did not charge prow to prow so much as on the side, after taking a circuit;)


7.36.3
5001
ἀντιπρῴροις γὰρ ταῖς ἐμβολαῖς χρώμενοι ἀναρρήξειν τὰ πρῴραθεν αὐτοῖς , στερίφοις καὶ παχέσι πρὸς κοῖλα καὶ ἀσθενῆ παίοντες τοῖς ἐμβόλοις .
and, moreover, that the battle being fought in the larger harbour, against a great number of ships in no great space, would be in their favour; for that by charging stem to stem they would stave in their prows, striking as they would with solid and stout beaks against hollow and weak ones.


7.36.4
5002
τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις οὐκ ἔσεσθαι σφῶν ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ οὔτε περίπλουν οὔτε διέκπλουν , ᾧπερ τῆς τέχνης μάλιστα ἐπίστευον ·
Nor would the Athenians in their narrow room have opportunity of sailing round or cutting through their line, the manoeuvres of their naval science in which they most confided;


7.36.4
5003
αὐτοὶ γὰρ κατὰ τὸ δυνατὸν τὸ μὲν οὐ δώσειν διεκπλεῖν , τὸ δὲ τὴν στενοχωρίαν κωλύσειν ὥστε μὴ περιπλεῖν .
for they themselves, to the best of their power, would not allow them to cut through their line, and the want of room would prevent their making a circuit.


7.36.5
5004
τῇ τε πρότερον ἀμαθίᾳ τῶν κυβερνητῶν δοκούσῃ εἶναι , τὸ ἀντίπρῳρον ξυγκροῦσαι , μάλιστ’ ἂν αὐτοὶ χρήσασθαι ·
And what was before thought to be want of skill in masters, namely, to charge stem to stem, was the very method they would chiefly adopt;


7.36.5
5005
πλεῖστον γὰρ ἐν αὐτῷ σχήσειν ·
for they would have the advantage in it;


7.36.5
5006
τὴν γὰρ ἀνάκρουσιν οὐκ ἔσεσθαι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐξωθουμένοις ἄλλοσε ἢ ἐς τὴν γῆν , καὶ ταύτην δι’ ὀλίγου καὶ ἐς ὀλίγον , κατ’ αὐτὸ τὸ στρατόπεδον τὸ ἑαυτῶν ·
as the Athenians, if forced out of the line, would have no means of backing water in any direction but towards shore, and that, too, at only a short distance from them, and for a short space, namely, just opposite their own encampment.


7.36.5
5007
τοῦ δ’ ἄλλου λιμένος αὐτοὶ κρατήσειν , καὶ ξυμφερομένους αὐτούς , ἤν πῃ βιάζωνται , ἐς ὀλίγον τε καὶ πάντας ἐς τὸ αὐτό , προσπίπτοντας ἀλλήλοις ταράξεσθαι ( ὅπερ καὶ ἔβλαπτε μάλιστα τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐν ἁπάσαις ταῖς ναυμαχίαις , οὐκ οὔσης αὐτοῖς ἐς πάντα τὸν λιμένα τῆς ἀνακρούσεως , ὥσπερ τοῖς Συρακοσίοις ) ·
The rest of the harbour they should themselves command;


7.36.6
5008
περιπλεῦσαι δὲ ἐς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν , σφῶν ἐχόντων τὴν ἐπίπλευσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ πελάγους τε καὶ ἀνάκρουσιν , οὐ δυνήσεσθαι αὐτούς , ἄλλως τε καὶ τοῦ Πλημμυρίου πολεμίου τε αὐτοῖς ἐσομένου καὶ τοῦ στόματος οὐ μεγάλου ὄντος τοῦ λιμένος .
and the enemy, if forced at any point, by crowding together into a confined space, and all to the same point, would run foul of each other, and be thrown into confusion; (the very thing, indeed, which most hurt the. Athenians in all their sea-fights, since they had not, like the Syracusans, the power of retreating over the whole harbour.) And as for making a circuit into clearer sea-room, since they themselves commanded the entrance from, and the retreat into, the open deep, they would not be able to do it; especially as Plemyrium would be hostile to them, and the mouth of the harbour was not large.


7.37.1
5009
τοιαῦτα οἱ Συρακόσιοι πρὸς τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἐπιστήμην τε καὶ δύναμιν ἐπινοήσαντες καὶ ἅμα τεθαρσηκότες μᾶλλον ἤδη ἀπὸ τῆς προτέρας ναυμαχίας , ἐπεχείρουν τῷ τε πεζῷ ἅμα καὶ ταῖς ναυσίν .
Having adopted such contrivances to suit their own degree of knowledge and power, and at the same time feeling now more assured in consequence of their former battle, the Syracusans prepared to attack them at once by land and by sea.


7.37.2
5010
καὶ τὸν μὲν πεζὸν ὀλίγῳ πρότερον τὸν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Γύλιππος προεξαγαγὼν προσῆγε τῷ τείχει τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καθ’ ὅσον πρὸς τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ ἑώρα ·
Those of their land forces which were in the city Gylippus led out a little before, and brought them up to the wall of the Athenians, at that part of it which looked towards the city;


7.37.2
5011
καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ὀλυμπιείου , οἵ τε ὁπλῖται ὅσοι ἐκεῖ ἦσαν καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς καὶ ἡ γυμνητεία τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ θάτερα προσῄει τῷ τείχει ·
while the troops from the Olympieum, both all the heavy-armed that were there, and the horse and light-armed of the Syracusans, advanced against the wall on the other side.


7.37.2
5012
αἱ δὲ νῆες μετὰ τοῦτο εὐθὺς ἐπεξέπλεον τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ξυμμάχων .
Immediately after this, the ships of the Syracusans and their allies sailed out.


7.37.3
5013
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸ πρῶτον αὐτοὺς οἰόμενοι τῷ πεζῷ μόνῳ πειράσειν , ὁρῶντες δὲ καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐπιφερομένας ἄφνω , ἐθορυβοῦντο , καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη καὶ πρὸ τῶν τειχῶν τοῖς προσιοῦσιν ἀντιπαρετάσσοντο , οἱ δὲ πρὸς τοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ Ὀλυμπιείου καὶ τῶν ἔξω κατὰ τάχος χωροῦντας ἱππέας τε πολλοὺς καὶ ἀκοντιστὰς ἀντεπεξῇσαν , ἄλλοι δὲ τὰς ναῦς ἐπλήρουν καὶ ἅμα ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν παρεβοήθουν , καὶ ἐπειδὴ πλήρεις ἦσαν , ἀντανῆγον πέντε καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα ναῦς ·
The Athenians thought at first that they would make an attempt on the land side alone, but when they saw their fleet also suddenly coming against them, they were thrown into alarm;


7.37.3
5014
καὶ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἦσαν ὀγδοήκοντα μάλιστα .
and some were making preparations on and in front of the walls to meet the attack, while others marched out against those who with all speed were coming from the Olympieum and the parts outside the city—both horse in great numbers and dart-men—and others proceeded to man the ships, and at once ran to the beach to oppose the enemy. And when they were manned, they put out against them with seventy-five vessels, those of the Syracusans being about eighty in number.


7.38.1
5015
τῆς δὲ ἡμέρας ἐπὶ πολὺ προσπλέοντες καὶ ἀνακρουόμενοι καὶ πειράσαντες ἀλλήλων καὶ οὐδέτεροι δυνάμενοι ἄξιόν τι λόγου παραλαβεῖν , εἰ μὴ ναῦν μίαν ἢ δύο τῶν Ἀθηναίων οἱ Συρακόσιοι καταδύσαντες , διεκρίθησαν ·
For a great part of the day they continued advancing and retiring and making attempts upon one another; and when neither party could gain any advantage worth mentioning, except that the Syracusans sank one or two of the Athenians' ships, they separated;


7.38.1
5016
καὶ ὁ πεζὸς ἅμα ἀπὸ τῶν τειχῶν ἀπῆλθεν .
and the troops at the same time withdrew from the walls.


7.38.2
5017
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι ἡσύχαζον , οὐδὲν δηλοῦντες ὁποῖόν τι τὸ μέλλον ποιήσουσιν ·
The next day the Syracusans remained quiet, without showing at all what were their plans for the future.


7.38.2
5018
ὁ δὲ Νικίας ἰδὼν ἀντίπαλα τὰ τῆς ναυμαχίας γενόμενα καὶ ἐλπίζων αὐτοὺς αὖθις ἐπιχειρήσειν τούς τε τριηράρχους ἠνάγκαζεν ἐπισκευάζειν τὰς ναῦς , εἴ τίς τι ἐπεπονήκει , καὶ ὁλκάδας προώρμισε πρὸ τοῦ σφετέρου σταυρώματος , ὃ αὐτοῖς πρὸ τῶν νεῶν ἀντὶ λιμένος κλῃστοῦ ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἐπεπήγει .
Nicias, on the other hand, seeing that the battle had been a drawn one, and expecting that they would attack them again, compelled the captains to refit their ships, whichever of them had at all suffered; and stationed merchantmen before the stockade which had been fixed in the sea in front of their ships, to serve the purpose of an enclosed harbour.


7.38.3
5019
διαλειπούσας δὲ τὰς ὁλκάδας ὅσον δύο πλέθρα ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων κατέστησεν , ὅπως , εἴ τις βιάζοιτο ναῦς , εἴη κατάφευξις ἀσφαλὴς καὶ πάλιν καθ’ ἡσυχίαν ἔκπλους .
These vessels he placed at intervals of two hundred feet from each other, that if any ship were hard pressed, it might have means of retreating in safety and sailing out again at leisure.


7.38.3
5020
παρασκευαζόμενοι δὲ ταῦτα ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν διετέλεσαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι μέχρι νυκτός .
The Athenians, then, continued to make these preparations during the whole day until the night.


7.39.1
5021
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ Συρακόσιοι τῆς μὲν ὥρας πρωίτερον , τῇ δ’ ἐπιχειρήσει τῇ αὐτῇ τοῦ τε πεζοῦ καὶ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ προσέμισγον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , καὶ ἀντικαταστάντες ταῖς ναυσὶ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον αὖθις ἐπὶ πολὺ διῆγον τῆς ἡμέρας πειρώμενοι ἀλλήλων , πρὶν δὴ Ἀρίστων ὁ Πυρρίχου Κορίνθιος , ἄριστος ὢν κυβερνήτης τῶν μετὰ Συρακοσίων , πείθει τοὺς σφετέρους τοῦ ναυτικοῦ ἄρχοντας , πέμψαντας ὡς τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐπιμελομένους , κελεύειν ὅτι τάχιστα τὴν ἀγορὰν τῶν πωλουμένων παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν μεταστῆσαι κομίσαντας , καὶ ὅσα τις ἔχει ἐδώδιμα , πάντας ἐκεῖσε φέροντας ἀναγκάσαι πωλεῖν , ὅπως αὐτοῖς ἐκβιβάσαντες τοὺς ναύτας εὐθὺς παρὰ τὰς ναῦς ἀριστοποιήσωνται , καὶ δι’ ὀλίγου αὖθις καὶ αὐθημερὸν ἀπροσδοκήτοις τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐπιχειρῶσιν .
The day following, the Syracusans engaged the Athenians at an earlier hour, but on the same plan of attack, both by sea and by land.


7.40.1
5022
καὶ οἱ μὲν πεισθέντες ἔπεμψαν ἄγγελον , καὶ ἡ ἀγορὰ παρεσκευάσθη , καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐξαίφνης πρύμναν κρουσάμενοι πάλιν πρὸς τὴν πόλιν ἔπλευσαν καὶ εὐθὺς ἐκβάντες αὐτοῦ ἄριστον ἐποιοῦντο ·
They, then, in compliance with this request sent a messenger, and the market was prepared: upon which the Syracusans suddenly backed water and sailed to the city, landing immediately, and taking their dinner:


7.40.2
5023
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι νομίσαντες αὐτοὺς ὡς ἡσσημένους σφῶν πρὸς τὴν πόλιν ἀνακρούσασθαι , καθ’ ἡσυχίαν ἐκβάντες τά τε ἄλλα διεπράσσοντο καὶ τὰ ἀμφὶ τὸ ἄριστον ὡς τῆς γε ἡμέρας ταύτης οὐκέτι οἰόμενοι ἂν ναυμαχῆσαι .
while the Athenians, supposing that they had retreated to the city because they were worsted by them, went ashore at their leisure, and were engaged both with other matters and with providing their dinner, imagining that for that day at least they would not have to fight again.


7.40.3
5024
ἐξαίφνης δὲ οἱ Συρακόσιοι πληρώσαντες τὰς ναῦς ἐπέπλεον αὖθις ·
But the Syracusans having suddenly manned their ships, sailed out against them a second time;


7.40.3
5025
οἱ δὲ διὰ πολλοῦ θορύβου καὶ ἄσιτοι οἱ πλείους οὐδενὶ κόσμῳ ἐσβάντες μόλις ποτὲ ἀντανήγοντο .
while in much confusion, and most of them unrefreshed, went on board without any order, and with great difficulty put off to meet them.


7.40.4
5026
καὶ χρόνον μέν τινα ἀπέσχοντο ἀλλήλων φυλασσόμενοι ·
For some time they forbore from attacking each other, and stood on their guard;


7.40.4
5027
ἔπειτα οὐκ ἐδόκει τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ὑπὸ σφῶν αὐτῶν διαμέλλοντας κόπῳ ἁλίσκεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἐπιχειρεῖν ὅτι τάχιστα , καὶ ἐπιφερόμενοι ἐκ παρακελεύσεως ἐναυμάχουν .
but afterwards the Athenians did not choose through their own act to be worn out with fatigue by waiting there, but to attack them as quickly as possible;


7.40.5
5028
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι δεξάμενοι καὶ ταῖς τε ναυσὶν ἀντιπρῴροις χρώμενοι , ὥσπερ διενοήθησαν , τῶν ἐμβόλων τῇ παρασκευῇ ἀνερρήγνυσαν τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ναῦς ἐπὶ πολὺ τῆς παρεξειρεσίας , καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν καταστρωμάτων αὐτοῖς ἀκοντίζοντες μεγάλα ἔβλαπτον τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , πολὺ δ’ ἔτι μείζω οἱ ἐν τοῖς λεπτοῖς πλοίοις περιπλέοντες τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ἔς τε τοὺς ταρσοὺς ὑποπίπτοντες τῶν πολεμίων νεῶν καὶ ἐς τὰ πλάγια παραπλέοντες καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐς τοὺς ναύτας ἀκοντίζοντες .
and so they advanced with a cheer, and commenced the action. The Syracusans received them, and charging with their ships stem to stem, as they had determined beforehand, with their beaks equipped as they were, they stove in the Athenian vessels to a considerable extent of the foreships, while the dart-men fighting on their decks inflicted great damage on the Athenians, and still more those Syracusans who were sailing about in their small boats, falling close in upon the oars of the enemy's ships, sailing up to their sides, and thence discharging their darts upon the seamen.


7.41.1
5029
τέλος δὲ τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ κατὰ κράτος ναυμαχοῦντες οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐνίκησαν , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τραπόμενοι διὰ τῶν ὁλκάδων τὴν κατάφευξιν ἐποιοῦντο ἐς τὸν ἑαυτῶν ὅρμον .
At length, by fighting in this way with all their might, the Syracusans gained the victory, and the Athenians turned and fled between the merchantmen into their own station.


7.41.2
5030
αἱ δὲ τῶν Συρακοσίων νῆες μέχρι μὲν τῶν ὁλκάδων ἐπεδίωκον ·
The Syracusan ships pursued them as far as those vessels;


7.41.2
5031
ἔπειτα αὐτοὺς αἱ κεραῖαι ὑπὲρ τῶν ἔσπλων αἱ ἀπὸ τῶν ὁλκάδων δελφινοφόροι ἠρμέναι ἐκώλυον .
but then the beams that were hung from the merchantmen over the passages between them, with dolphins attached to them, stopped their progress.


7.41.3
5032
δύο δὲ νῆες τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐπαιρόμεναι τῇ νίκῃ προσέμειξαν αὐτῶν ἐγγὺς καὶ διεφθάρησαν , καὶ ἡ ἑτέρα αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἑάλω .
Two, however, elated by their victory, came up close to them, and were destroyed, one of them being captured with its crew.


7.41.4
5033
καταδύσαντες δ’ οἱ Συρακόσιοι τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἑπτὰ ναῦς καὶ κατατραυματίσαντες πολλὰς ἄνδρας τε τοὺς μὲν πολλοὺς ζωγρήσαντες , τοὺς δὲ ἀποκτείναντες ἀπεχώρησαν , καὶ τροπαῖά τε ἀμφοτέρων τῶν ναυμαχιῶν ἔστησαν , καὶ τὴν ἐλπίδα ἤδη ἐχυρὰν εἶχον ταῖς μὲν ναυσὶ καὶ πολὺ κρείσσους εἶναι , ἐδόκουν δὲ καὶ τὸν πεζὸν χειρώσεσθαι .
After the Syracusans had sunk seven Athenian ships and disabled many more, having taken some of the men prisoners and killed others, they retired, and erected trophies for both the engagements; entertaining now a confident hope that by sea they were very decidedly superior, and thinking that they should conquer the enemy's land forces also. Accordingly they began to prepare for making another attack in both ways.


7.42.1
5034
καὶ οἱ μὲν ὡς ἐπιθησόμενοι κατ’ ἀμφότερα παρεσκευάζοντο αὖθις , ἐν τούτῳ δὲ Δημοσθένης καὶ Εὐρυμέδων ἔχοντες τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν βοήθειαν παραγίγνονται , ναῦς τε τρεῖς καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα μάλιστα ξὺν ταῖς ξενικαῖς καὶ ὁπλίτας περὶ πεντακισχιλίους ἑαυτῶν τε καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων , ἀκοντιστάς τε βαρβάρους καὶ Ἕλληνας οὐκ ὀλίγους , καὶ σφενδονήτας καὶ τοξότας καὶ τὴν ἄλλην παρασκευὴν ἱκανήν .
At this time Demosthenes and Eurymedon arrived with the succours from Athens, consisting of above seventy-three ships (including the foreign ones) and about five thousand heavy-armed of their own and the allies, with dart-men, both Grecian and barbarian, not a few, slingers, bow-men, and the rest of the armament on a large scale.


7.42.2
5035
καὶ τοῖς μὲν Συρακοσίοις καὶ ξυμμάχοις κατάπληξις ἐν τῷ αὐτίκα οὐκ ὀλίγη ἐγένετο , εἰ πέρας μηδὲν ἔσται σφίσι τοῦ ἀπαλλαγῆναι τοῦ κινδύνου , ὁρῶντες οὔτε διὰ τὴν Δεκέλειαν τειχιζομένην οὐδὲν ἧσσον στρατὸν ἴσον καὶ παραπλήσιον τῷ προτέρῳ ἐπεληλυθότα τήν τε τῶν Ἀθηναίων δύναμιν πανταχόσε πολλὴν φαινομένην ·
No slight consternation was produced at the moment amongst the Syracusans and their allies, at the thought that they were to have no final deliverance from their dangers, seeing that there was newly come, none the less for the fortification of Decelea, an armament equal, or nearly so, to the first, and that the power of the Athenians appeared great on all sides;


7.42.2
5036
τῷ δὲ προτέρῳ στρατεύματι τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὡς ἐκ κακῶν ῥώμη τις ἐγεγένητο .
while in the former Athenian forces fresh confidence (considering their late misfortunes) had now sprung up.


7.42.3
5037
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης ἰδὼν ὡς εἶχε τὰ πράγματα καὶ νομίσας οὐχ οἷόν τε εἶναι διατρίβειν οὐδὲ παθεῖν ὅπερ ὁ Νικίας ἔπαθεν ( ἀφικόμενος γὰρ τὸ πρῶτον ὁ Νικίας φοβερός , ὡς οὐκ εὐθὺς προσέκειτο ταῖς Συρακούσαις , ἀλλ’ ἐν Κατάνῃ διεχείμαζεν , ὑπερώφθη τε καὶ ἔφθασεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς Πελοποννήσου στρατιᾷ ὁ Γύλιππος ἀφικόμενος , ἣν οὐδ’ ἂν μετέπεμψαν οἱ Συρακόσιοι , εἰ ἐκεῖνος εὐθὺς ἐπέκειτο ·
Demosthenes, on the other hand, seeing how matters stood, thought that it was not possible for him to waste the time, and so to experience the fate which Nicias had done.


7.42.3
5038
ἱκανοὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ οἰόμενοι εἶναι ἅμα τ’ ἂν ἔμαθον ἥσσους ὄντες καὶ ἀποτετειχισμένοι ἂν ἦσαν , ὥστε μηδ’ εἰ μετέπεμψαν ἔτι ὁμοίως ἂν αὐτοὺς ὠφελεῖν ) , ταῦτα οὖν ἀνασκοπῶν ὁ Δημοσθένης , καὶ γιγνώσκων ὅτι καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ παρόντι τῇ πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ μάλιστα δεινότατός ἐστι τοῖς ἐναντίοις , ἐβούλετο ὅτι τάχος ἀποχρήσασθαι τῇ παρούσῃ τοῦ στρατεύματος ἐκπλήξει .
For although that general spread terror on his first arrival, he was despised, through not immediately attacking Syracuse, but spending the winter at Catana, and Gylippus anticipated his success by arriving with forces from the Peloponnese, which the Syracusans would never have sent for at all if he had immediately attacked them; for while fancying themselves a match for him, they would at once have discovered their inferiority, and have been invested; so that, even if they had sat for them, they would not then have done them the same service. Reviewing these things, then, and thinking that he himself too was decidedly most formidable to the adversary at the present time, even the very first day, Demosthenes wished, as quickly as possible, to avail himself to the utmost of the present dismay of their forces.


7.42.4
5039
καὶ ὁρῶν τὸ παρατείχισμα τῶν Συρακοσίων , ᾧ ἐκώλυσαν περιτειχίσαι σφᾶς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , ἁπλοῦν ὂν καί , εἰ κρατήσειέ τις τῶν τε Ἐπιπολῶν τῆς ἀναβάσεως καὶ αὖθις τοῦ ἐν αὐταῖς στρατοπέδου , ῥᾳδίως ἂν αὐτὸ ληφθέν ( οὐδὲ γὰρ ὑπομεῖναι ἂν σφᾶς οὐδένα ) , ἠπείγετο ἐπιθέσθαι τῇ πείρᾳ , καί οἱ ξυντομωτάτην ἡγεῖτο διαπολέμησιν ·
And seeing that the counter-wall of the Syracusans, by which they had prevented the Athenians from circumvallating them, was but a single one, and that if any one had carried the ascent to Epipolae, and then the camp on it, the work might easily be taken, (for no one at all would so much as wait his attack,) he was in a hurry to make the attempt.


7.42.5
5040
ἢ γὰρ κατορθώσας ἕξειν Συρακούσας , ἢ ἀπάξειν τὴν στρατιὰν καὶ οὐ τρίψεσθαι ἄλλως Ἀθηναίους τε τοὺς ξυστρατευομένους καὶ τὴν ξύμπασαν πόλιν .
And this he thought was his shortest way of bringing the war to a conclusion; for he would either gain possession of Syracuse by succeeding in his design, or lead back the armament, and not exhaust for no purpose both the Athenians who joined the expedition and the whole state.


7.42.6
5041
πρῶτον μὲν οὖν τήν τε γῆν ἐξελθόντες τῶν Συρακοσίων ἔτεμον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι περὶ τὸν Ἄναπον , καὶ τῷ στρατεύματι ἐπεκράτουν ὥσπερ τὸ πρῶτον , τῷ τε πεζῷ καὶ ταῖς ναυσίν ( οὐδὲ γὰρ καθ’ ἕτερα οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἀντεπεξῇσαν ὅτι μὴ τοῖς ἱππεῦσι καὶ ἀκοντισταῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ Ὀλυμπιείου ) ·
In the first place, then, the Athenians went out and ravaged a part of the Syracusan territory, about the Anapus, and were superior in force, as they had originally been, both by land and by sea: (for in neither way did the Syracusans come out against them, except with their cavalry and dart-men from the Olympieum.)


7.43.1
5042
ἔπειτα μηχαναῖς ἔδοξε τῷ Δημοσθένει πρότερον ἀποπειρᾶσαι τοῦ παρατειχίσματος .
Afterwards, Demosthenes resolved first to make an attempt on the counter-work with engines.


7.43.1
5043
ὡς δὲ αὐτῷ προσαγαγόντι κατεκαύθησάν τε ὑπὸ τῶν ἐναντίων ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ἀμυνομένων αἱ μηχαναὶ καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ στρατιᾷ πολλαχῇ προσβάλλοντες ἀπεκρούοντο , οὐκέτι ἐδόκει διατρίβειν , ἀλλὰ πείσας τόν τε Νικίαν καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ξυνάρχοντας , ὡς ἐπενόει , τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν ἐποιεῖτο .
But when the engines, after he had brought them up, were burnt by the enemy who were making a defence from the wall, and they were beaten back when charging at many points with the rest of his forces, he determined to delay no longer; but having gained the assent of Nicias and the rest of his colleagues, according to the plan he had formed, he proceeded to the attempt on Epipolae.


7.43.2
5044
καὶ ἡμέρας μὲν ἀδύνατα ἐδόκει εἶναι λαθεῖν προσελθόντας τε καὶ ἀναβάντας , παραγγείλας δὲ πέντε ἡμερῶν σιτία καὶ τοὺς λιθολόγους καὶ τέκτονας πάντας λαβὼν καὶ ἄλλην παρασκευὴν τοξευμάτων τε καὶ ὅσα ἔδει , ἢν κρατῶσι , τειχίζοντας ἔχειν , αὐτὸς μὲν ἀπὸ πρώτου ὕπνου καὶ Εὐρυμέδων καὶ Μένανδρος ἀναλαβὼν τὴν πᾶσαν στρατιὰν ἐχώρει πρὸς τὰς Ἐπιπολάς , Νικίας δὲ ἐν τοῖς τείχεσιν ὑπελέλειπτο .
Now, in the day-time it seemed to be impossible for them to approach and make the ascent unobserved. But having issued orders for five days' provisions, and taken all the stone-masons and carpenters, with all the other apparatus besides, both arrows and every thing else that was necessary for them, should they succeed, to have while they were building, he himself, with Eurymedon and Menander, took the whole force, after the first watch of the night, and advanced against Epipolae, Nicias being left behind in the lines.


7.43.3
5045
καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐγένοντο πρὸς αὐταῖς κατὰ τὸν Εὐρύηλον , ᾗπερ καὶ ἡ προτέρα στρατιὰ τὸ πρῶτον ἀνέβη , λανθάνουσί τε τοὺς φύλακας τῶν Συρακοσίων , καὶ προσβάντες τὸ τείχισμα ὃ ἦν αὐτόθι τῶν Συρακοσίων αἱροῦσι καὶ ἄνδρας τῶν φυλάκων ἀποκτείνουσιν .
When they had come up to the hill on the side of Euryelus, the same way that the former army also had in the first instance made the ascent, they escaped the observation of the Syracusan guard, and having gone to the fort of the Syracusans which was there, they took it, and put part of the garrison to the sword.


7.43.4
5046
οἱ δὲ πλείους διαφυγόντες εὐθὺς πρὸς τὰ στρατόπεδα , ἃ ἦν ἐπὶ τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν τρία ἐν προτειχίσμασιν , ἓν μὲν τῶν Συρακοσίων , ἓν δὲ τῶν ἄλλων Σικελιωτῶν , ἓν δὲ τῶν ξυμμάχων , ἀγγέλλουσι τὴν ἔφοδον καὶ τοῖς ἑξακοσίοις τῶν Συρακοσίων , οἳ καὶ πρῶτοι κατὰ τοῦτο τὸ μέρος τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν φύλακες ἦσαν , ἔφραζον .
But the greater part fled immediately to the camps, (of which there were three on Epipolae, in outworks, one composed of the Syracusans, one of the other Siceliots, and one of their allies,) and informed them of the attack, and told it to the six hundred Syracusans who had formed the original guard at this part of Epipolae.


7.43.5
5047
οἱ δ’ ἐβοήθουν τ’ εὐθύς , καὶ αὐτοῖς ὁ Δημοσθένης καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐντυχόντες ἀμυνομένους προθύμως ἔτρεψαν .
They immediately went against them; and Demosthenes and the Athenians falling in with them, routed them, though they made a spirited resistance.


7.43.5
5048
καὶ αὐτοὶ μὲν εὐθὺς ἐχώρουν ἐς τὸ πρόσθεν , ὅπως τῇ παρούσῃ ὁρμῇ τοῦ περαίνεσθαι ὧν ἕνεκα ἦλθον μὴ βραδεῖς γένωνται ·
They then immediately pressed on, that they might not be retarded in their present eagerness for accomplishing the objects they had come for:


7.43.5
5049
ἄλλοι δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς πρώτης τὸ παρατείχισμα τῶν Συρακοσίων οὐχ ὑπομενόντων τῶν φυλάκων ᾕρουν τε καὶ τὰς ἐπάλξεις ἀπέσυρον .
while others of them proceeded, as their first measure, to take the counter-wall of the Syracusans, and pull down its battlements.


7.43.6
5050
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι καὶ ὁ Γύλιππος καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ ἐβοήθουν ἐκ τῶν προτειχισμάτων , καὶ ἀδοκήτου τοῦ τολμήματος σφίσιν ἐν νυκτὶ γενομένου προσέβαλόν τε τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐκπεπληγμένοι καὶ βιασθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτῶν τὸ πρῶτον ὑπεχώρησαν .
The Syracusans and their allies, as well as Gylippus and his division, went to the rescue from the outworks; and as they had had this daring attack made on them in the night, they engaged the Athenians in some dismay, and were at first compelled to retreat.


7.43.7
5051
προϊόντων δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐν ἀταξίᾳ μᾶλλον ἤδη ὡς κεκρατηκότων καὶ βουλομένων διὰ παντὸς τοῦ μήπω μεμαχημένου τῶν ἐναντίων ὡς τάχιστα διελθεῖν , ἵνα μὴ ἀνέντων σφῶν τῆς ἐφόδου αὖθις ξυστραφῶσιν , οἱ Βοιωτοὶ πρῶτοι αὐτοῖς ἀντέσχον καὶ προσβαλόντες ἔτρεψάν τε καὶ ἐς φυγὴν κατέστησαν .
But when the Athenians were now advancing in greater confusion, as having gained the victory, and were anxious to pass as quickly as possible through the whole force of the enemy which had not yet been engaged, that they might not rally again through their relaxing in the attack; the Boeotians were the first to oppose them, and both broke them by their charge, and put them to flight.


7.44.1
5052
καὶ ἐνταῦθα ἤδη ἐν πολλῇ ταραχῇ καὶ ἀπορίᾳ ἐγίγνοντο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἣν οὐδὲ πυθέσθαι ῥᾴδιον ἦν οὐδ’ ἀφ’ ἑτέρων ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἕκαστα ξυνηνέχθη .
Now the Athenians were by this time in much disorder and perplexity; but on this subject it was not easy for me to ascertain from either side, in what way each event occurred.


7.44.1
5053
ἐν μὲν γὰρ ἡμέρᾳ σαφέστερα μέν , ὅμως δὲ οὐδὲ ταῦτα οἱ παραγενόμενοι πάντα πλὴν τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἕκαστος μόλις οἶδεν ·
For in the day-time the parties engaged have, indeed, a clearer knowledge, though not a perfect one even then, for each man barely knows what happens in his own part of the field.


7.44.1
5054
ἐν δὲ νυκτομαχίᾳ , ἣ μόνη δὴ στρατοπέδων μεγάλων ἔν γε τῷδε τῷ πολέμῳ ἐγένετο , πῶς ἄν τις σαφῶς τι ᾔδει ;
But in a night engagement, (and this was the only one which occurred between great armies during this war,) how could any one have a distinct knowledge of anything?


7.44.2
5055
ἦν μὲν γὰρ σελήνη λαμπρά , ἑώρων δὲ οὕτως ἀλλήλους ὡς ἐν σελήνῃ εἰκὸς τὴν μὲν ὄψιν τοῦ σώματος προορᾶν , τὴν δὲ γνῶσιν τοῦ οἰκείου ἀπιστεῖσθαι .
For though there was a bright moon, they only saw one another (as was natural they should by moonlight) so as to discern the form of the body before them, but to mistrust their knowledge of its being that of a friend.


7.44.2
5056
ὁπλῖται δὲ ἀμφοτέρων οὐκ ὀλίγοι ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ ἀνεστρέφοντο .
And there were no few heavy-armed on each side moving in a narrow space.


7.44.3
5057
καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων οἱ μὲν ἤδη ἐνικῶντο , οἱ δ’ ἔτι τῇ πρώτῃ ἐφόδῳ ἀήσσητοι ἐχώρουν .
Thus on the side of the Athenians some were even now being defeated, and others coming up unconquered for their first attack.


7.44.3
5058
πολὺ δὲ καὶ τοῦ ἄλλου στρατεύματος αὐτοῖς τὸ μὲν ἄρτι ἀνεβεβήκει , τὸ δ’ ἔτι προσανῄει , ὥστ’ οὐκ ἠπίσταντο πρὸς ὅτι χρὴ χωρῆσαι .
A large part, too, of the rest of their forces had only just ascended, and others were still ascending; so that they did not know on what point to advance.


7.44.3
5059
ἤδη γὰρ τὰ πρόσθεν τῆς τροπῆς γεγενημένης ἐτετάρακτο πάντα καὶ χαλεπὰ ἦν ὑπὸ τῆς βοῆς διαγνῶναι .
For in consequence of the rout which had taken place, everything in front was now in confusion, and it was difficult to distinguish orders through the uproar.


7.44.4
5060
οἵ τε γὰρ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ὡς κρατοῦντες παρεκελεύοντό τε κραυγῇ οὐκ ὀλίγῃ χρώμενοι , ἀδύνατον ὂν ἐν νυκτὶ ἄλλῳ τῳ σημῆναι , καὶ ἅμα τοὺς προσφερομένους ἐδέχοντο ·
For the Syracusans and their allies, on gaining the advantage, were cheering each other with no little shouting, (it being impossible during the night to express themselves in any other way,) and at the same time were receiving the charge of their assailants:


7.44.4
5061
οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι ἐζήτουν τε σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ πᾶν τὸ ἐξ ἐναντίας , καὶ εἰ φίλιον εἴη τῶν ἤδη πάλιν φευγόντων , πολέμιον ἐνόμιζον , καὶ τοῖς ἐρωτήμασι τοῦ ξυνθήματος πυκνοῖς χρώμενοι διὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἄλλῳ τῳ γνωρίσαι σφίσι τε αὐτοῖς θόρυβον πολὺν παρεῖχον ἅμα πάντες ἐρωτῶντες καὶ τοῖς πολεμίοις σαφὲς αὐτὸ κατέστησαν ·
And by their frequently asking for the watchword, because they could not by any other means distinguish them, they both caused great confusion on their own side by all asking at once, and made it known to the enemy;


7.44.5
5062
τὸ δ’ ἐκείνων οὐχ ὁμοίως ἠπίσταντο διὰ τὸ κρατοῦντας αὐτοὺς καὶ μὴ διεσπασμένους ἧσσον ἀγνοεῖσθαι , ὥστ’ εἰ μὲν ἐντύχοιέν τισι κρείσσους ὄντες τῶν πολεμίων , διέφευγον αὐτοὺς ἅτε ἐκείνων ἐπιστάμενοι τὸ ξύνθημα , εἰ δ’ αὐτοὶ μὴ ἀποκρίνοιντο , διεφθείροντο .
while theirs, on the other hand, they did not so easily discover, because, as they were victorious and not dispersed, they were better recognised by each other. So that if they fell in with any of the enemy with the advantage of numbers en their own side, the Syracusans escaped from them, inasmuch as they knew the Athenian watchword;


7.44.6
5063
μέγιστον δὲ καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα ἔβλαψε καὶ ὁ παιανισμός ·
but if they themselves [in such a case] did not answer, they were put to the sword.


7.44.6
5064
ἀπὸ γὰρ ἀμφοτέρων παραπλήσιος ὢν ἀπορίαν παρεῖχεν .
But what especially and in the greatest degree hurt them, was the singing of their hymns;


7.44.6
5065
οἵ τε γὰρ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ οἱ Κερκυραῖοι καὶ ὅσον Δωρικὸν μετ’ Ἀθηναίων ἦν , ὁπότε παιανίσειαν , φόβον παρεῖχε τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , οἵ τε πολέμιοι ὁμοίως .
for as it was very similar on each side, it occasioned perplexity. For the Argives, the Corcyraeans, and all of the Dorian race that were with the Athenians, struck terror into them whenever they raised their paean;


7.44.7
5066
ὥστε τέλος ξυμπεσόντες αὑτοῖς κατὰ πολλὰ τοῦ στρατοπέδου , ἐπεὶ ἅπαξ ἐταράχθησαν , φίλοι τε φίλοις καὶ πολῖται πολίταις , οὐ μόνον ἐς φόβον κατέστησαν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐς χεῖρας ἀλλήλοις ἐλθόντες μόλις ἀπελύοντο .
and so did the enemy likewise. Thus having at last, when once they were thrown into disorder, come into collision with each other in different parts of the army, friends with friends, and countrymen with countrymen, they were not only full of fear, but even closed in battle with each other, and were with difficulty parted.


7.44.8
5067
καὶ διωκόμενοι κατά τε τῶν κρημνῶν οἱ πολλοὶ ῥίπτοντες ἑαυτοὺς ἀπώλλυντο , στενῆς οὔσης τῆς ἀπὸ τῶν Ἐπιπολῶν πάλιν καταβάσεως , καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐς τὸ ὁμαλὸν οἱ σῳζόμενοι ἄνωθεν καταβαῖεν , οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ αὐτῶν καὶ ὅσοι ἦσαν τῶν προτέρων στρατιωτῶν ἐμπειρίᾳ μᾶλλον τῆς χώρας ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον διεφύγγανον , οἱ δὲ ὕστερον ἥκοντες εἰσὶν οἳ διαμαρτόντες τῶν ὁδῶν κατὰ τὴν χώραν ἐπλανήθησαν ·
And now, as they were being pursued, the greater part threw themselves down the cliffs, and perished; as the way down again from Epipolae was narrow.


7.44.8
5068
οὕς ,ἐπειδὴ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο , οἱ ἱππῆς τῶν Συρακοσίων περιελάσαντες διέφθειραν .
And when those who escaped from the heights had reached the plain, though many of them, especially such as belonged to the former armament, through their greater acquaintance with the localities escaped safely to the camp, some of those who had lately arrived lost their way, and wandered about the country; and these, when it was day, the Syracusan horse intercepted, and put to the sword.


7.45.1
5069
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι δύο τροπαῖα ἔστησαν , ἐπί τε ταῖς Ἐπιπολαῖς ᾗ ἡ πρόσβασις καὶ κατὰ τὸ χωρίον ᾗ οἱ Βοιωτοὶ πρῶτον ἀντέστησαν , οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἐκομίσαντο .
The next day the Syracusans erected two trophies, one on Epipolae, where the enemy's approaches had been made, and the other on the spot where the Boeotians first withstood them; while the Athenians recovered their dead under truce.


7.45.2
5070
ἀπέθανον δὲ οὐκ ὀλίγοι αὐτῶν τε καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων , ὅπλα μέντοι ἔτι πλείω ἢ κατὰ τοὺς νεκροὺς ἐλήφθη ·
No few were killed, both of themselves and their allies, though still more arms were taken than in proportion to the number of the dead:


7.45.2
5071
οἱ γὰρ κατὰ τῶν κρημνῶν βιασθέντες ἅλλεσθαι ψιλοὶ ἄνευ τῶν ἀσπίδων οἱ μὲν ἀπώλλυντο , οἱ δ’ ἐσώθησαν .
for of those who were compelled to leap down the cliffs unencumbered by their shields, though some perished, yet others escaped with their lives.


7.46.1
5072
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι ὡς ἐπὶ ἀπροσδοκήτῳ εὐπραγίᾳ πάλιν αὖ ἀναρρωσθέντες , ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον , ἐς μὲν Ἀκράγαντα στασιάζοντα πέντε καὶ δέκα ναυσὶ Σικανὸν ἀπέστειλαν , ὅπως ὑπαγάγοιτο τὴν πόλιν , εἰ δύναιτο ·
After this, the Syracusans being again, as before, restored to confidence on the strength of such unexpected good fortune, despatched Sicanus with fifteen ships to Acragas, which was torn by factions, to induce the city to join them, if he could:


7.46.1
5073
Γύλιππος δὲ κατὰ γῆν ἐς τὴν ἄλλην Σικελίαν ᾤχετο αὖθις , ἄξων στρατιὰν ἔτι , ὡς ἐν ἐλπίδι ὢν καὶ τὰ τείχη τῶν Ἀθηναίων αἱρήσειν βίᾳ , ἐπειδὴ τὰ ἐν ταῖς Ἐπιπολαῖς οὕτω ξυνέβη .
while Gylippus again went by land to the other parts of Sicily to bring more forces, being in hope of even taking the Athenian lines by storm, since the affair on Epipolae had turned out as it did.


7.47.1
5074
οἱ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοὶ ἐν τούτῳ ἐβουλεύοντο πρός τε τὴν γεγενημένην ξυμφορὰν καὶ πρὸς τὴν παροῦσαν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ κατὰ πάντα ἀρρωστίαν .
The Athenian commanders, in the mean time, consulted on the disaster which had befallen them, and on the want of vigour which at present on all accounts prevailed in their camp;


7.47.1
5075
τοῖς τε γὰρ ἐπιχειρήμασιν ἑώρων οὐ κατορθοῦντες καὶ τοὺς στρατιώτας ἀχθομένους τῇ μονῇ ·
seeing that they were both unsuccessful in their attempts, and that the soldiers were annoyed by their stay in the country.


7.47.2
5076
νόσῳ τε γὰρ ἐπιέζοντο κατ’ ἀμφότερα , τῆς τε ὥρας τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ταύτης οὔσης ἐν ᾗ ἀσθενοῦσιν ἄνθρωποι μάλιστα , καὶ τὸ χωρίον ἅμα ἐν ᾧ ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο ἑλῶδες καὶ χαλεπὸν ἦν , τά τε ἄλλα ὅτι ἀνέλπιστα αὐτοῖς ἐφαίνετο .
For they were suffering with sickness from two different causes, both because this was the season of the year at which men are most liable to disease, and at the same time, too, because the position in which they were encamped was marshy and unfavourable; while they were also distressed because every thing else appeared hopeless to them. Demosthenes then, was of opinion that they ought not to stay any longer;


7.47.3
5077
τῷ οὖν Δημοσθένει οὐκ ἐδόκει ἔτι χρῆναι μένειν , ἀλλ’ ἅπερ καὶ διανοηθεὶς ἐς τὰς Ἐπιπολὰς διεκινδύνευσεν , ἐπειδὴ ἔσφαλτο , ἀπιέναι ἐψηφίζετο καὶ μὴ διατρίβειν , ἕως ἔτι τὸ πέλαγος οἷόν τε περαιοῦσθαι καὶ τοῦ στρατεύματος ταῖς γοῦν ἐπελθούσαις ναυσὶ κρατεῖν .
but, according to the plan with which he had hazarded the attack on Epipolae, since that had failed, he gave his vote for departing, and not wasting the time, while the sea might yet be crossed, and while, as regarded forces, they might command the superiority with the squadron that had lately joined them, at any rate.


7.47.4
5078
καὶ τῇ πόλει ὠφελιμώτερον ἔφη εἶναι πρὸς τοὺς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ σφῶν ἐπιτειχίζοντας τὸν πόλεμον ποιεῖσθαι ἢ Συρακοσίους , οὓς οὐκέτι ῥᾴδιον εἶναι χειρώσασθαι ·
He said, too, that it would be more beneficial to the state to carry on the war against those who were building fortresses for their annoyance in their own country, than against the Syracusans, whom it was no longer easy to subdue:


7.47.4
5079
οὐδ’ αὖ ἄλλως χρήματα πολλὰ δαπανῶντας εἰκὸς εἶναι προσκαθῆσθαι .
nor, again, was it right for them to waste large sums of money to no purpose by continuing the siege. Such, then, was the view entertained by Demosthenes.


7.48.1
5080
καὶ ὁ μὲν Δημοσθένης τοιαῦτα ἐγίγνωσκεν ·
Nicias, however, though he too considered their circumstances to be bad, yet did not wish to display their weakness by words,


7.48.1
5081
ὁ δὲ Νικίας ἐνόμιζε μὲν καὶ αὐτὸς πονηρά σφῶν τὰ πράγματα εἶναι , τῷ δὲ λόγῳ οὐκ ἐβούλετο αὐτὰ ἀσθενῆ ἀποδεικνύναι , οὐδ’ ἐμφανῶς σφᾶς ψηφιζομένους μετὰ πολλῶν τὴν ἀναχώρησιν τοῖς πολεμίοις καταγγέλτους γίγνεσθαι ·
nor that they should become a laughing-stock to their enemies by voting for the retreat openly, and in conjunction with many.


7.48.1
5082
λαθεῖν γὰρ ἄν , ὁπότε βούλοιντο , τοῦτο ποιοῦντες πολλῷ ἧσσον .
For so they would far less elude their observation in executing it, whenever they might wish.


7.48.2
5083
τὸ δέ τι καὶ τὰ τῶν πολεμίων , ἀφ’ ὧν ἐπὶ πλέον ἢ οἱ ἄλλοι ᾐσθάνετο αὐτῶν , ἐλπίδος τι ἔτι παρεῖχε πονηρότερα τῶν σφετέρων ἔσεσθαι , ἢν καρτερῶσι προσκαθήμενοι ·
To a certain extent also the affairs of the enemy, judging from what he, more than others, knew of them, still afforded some hope that they would be worse than their own, should they persist in carrying on the siege;


7.48.2
5084
χρημάτων γὰρ ἀπορίᾳ αὐτοὺς ἐκτρυχώσειν , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐπὶ πλέον ἤδη ταῖς ὑπαρχούσαις ναυσὶ θαλασσοκρατούντων .
for so they would exhaust them by want of funds;


7.48.2
5085
καὶ ἦν γάρ τι καὶ ἐν ταῖς Συρακούσαις βουλόμενον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τὰ πράγματα ἐνδοῦναι , ἐπεκηρυκεύετο ὡς αὐτὸν καὶ οὐκ εἴα ἀπανίστασθαι .
especially, too, as they had now, with their present fleet, a more extensive command of the sea. A party in Syracuse also, which wished to surrender the city to the Athenians, was sending messengers to him, and urging him not to raise the siege. Knowing these things, then, he was in fact waiting because he was still inclined both ways, and wished to see his course more clearly;


7.48.3
5086
ἃ ἐπιστάμενος τῷ μὲν ἔργῳ ἔτι ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα ἔχων καὶ διασκοπῶν ἀνεῖχε , τῷ δ’ ἐμφανεῖ τότε λόγῳ οὐκ ἔφη ἀπάξειν τὴν στρατιάν .
but in the speech openly made by him on that occasion he said, “that he refused to withdraw the forces;


7.48.3
5087
εὖ γὰρ εἰδέναι ὅτι Ἀθηναῖοι σφῶν ταῦτα οὐκ ἀποδέξονται , ὥστε μὴ αὐτῶν ψηφισαμένων ἀπελθεῖν .
for he well knew that the Athenians would not put up with such a step on the part of the generals—their returning, he meant, without a vote from themselves to authorize it.


7.48.3
5088
καὶ γὰρ οὐ τοὺς αὐτοὺς ψηφιεῖσθαί τε περὶ σφῶν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ πράγματα ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτοὶ ὁρῶντας καὶ οὐκ ἄλλων ἐπιτιμήσει ἀκούσαντας γνώσεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἐξ ὧν ἄν τις εὖ λέγων διαβάλλοι , ἐκ τούτων αὐτοὺς πείσεσθαι .
Besides, those who would vote in their case, would not give their verdict from seeing the facts, as they themselves had done, instead of hearing them from the invectives of others; but whatever calumnies any clever speaker threw upon them, by those would they be persuaded.”


7.48.4
5089
τῶν τε παρόντων στρατιωτῶν πολλοὺς καὶ τοὺς πλείους ἔφη , οἳ νῦν βοῶσιν ὡς ἐν δεινοῖς ὄντες , ἐκεῖσε ἀφικομένους τ- ἐναντία βοήσεσθαι ὡς ὑπὸ χρημάτων καταπροδόντες οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἀπῆλθον .
“Many too, nay, even the greater part of the soldiers present on the spot, who were now clamouring about their perilous condition, would, he said, on arriving there, raise the very contrary clamour, namely, that their generals had utterly betrayed them for money, when they returned.”


7.48.4
5090
οὔκουν βούλεσθαι αὐτός γε ἐπιστάμενος τὰς Ἀθηναίων φύσεις ἐπ’ αἰσχρᾷ τε αἰτίᾳ καὶ ἀδίκως ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων ἀπολέσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων , εἰ δεῖ , κινδυνεύσας τοῦτο παθεῖν ἰδίᾳ .
“Nor would he, knowing the temper of the Athenians, wish to perish disgracefully and unjustly at their hands, rather than at those of the enemy, if he must suffer this fate in person.”


7.48.5
5091
τά τε Συρακοσίων ἔφη ὅμως ἔτι ἥσσω τῶν σφετέρων εἶναι ·
“For supporting mercenaries as they had to do with their funds, and at the same time spending them on guard-posts,


7.48.5
5092
καὶ χρήμασι γὰρ αὐτοὺς ξενοτροφοῦντας καὶ ἐν περιπολίοις ἅμα ἀναλίσκοντας καὶ ναυτικὸν πολὺ ἔτι ἐνιαυτὸν ἤδη βόσκοντας τὰ μὲν ἀπορεῖν , τὰ δ’ ἔτι ἀμηχανήσειν ·
and maintaining, moreover, a large navy, as they had now done for more than a year, they were in some respects ill provided, and in others would be still more at a loss,


7.48.5
5093
δισχίλιά τε γὰρ τάλαντα ἤδη ἀνηλωκέναι καὶ ἔτι πολλὰ προσοφείλειν , ἤν τε καὶ ὁτιοῦν ἐκλίπωσι τῆς νῦν παρασκευῆς τῷ μὴ διδόναι τροφήν , φθερεῖσθαι αὐτῶν τὰ πράγματα , ἐπικουρικὰ μᾶλλον ἢ δι’ ἀνάγκης ὥσπερ τὰ σφέτερα ὄντα .
as they had already expended two hundred talents, and still owed many more; and should they lose any part whatever of their present forces through not giving them supplies, their cause would be ruined, as it was supported by voluntary aid, rather than by compulsory exertions, like theirs.”


7.48.6
5094
τρίβειν οὖν ἔφη χρῆναι προσκαθημένους καὶ μὴ χρήμασιν , ὧν πολὺ κρείσσους εἰσί , νικηθέντας ἀπιέναι .
" He maintained, therefore, that they must continue to carry on the siege, and not go away defeated in point of money, wherein they were decidedly superior."


7.49.1
5095
ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοσαῦτα λέγων ἰσχυρίζετο , αἰσθόμενος τὰ ἐν ταῖς Συρακούσαις ἀκριβῶς καὶ τὴν τῶν χρημάτων ἀπορίαν καὶ ὅτι ἦν αὐτόθι πολὺ τὸ βουλόμενον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις γίγνεσθαι τὰ πράγματα καὶ ἐπικηρυκευόμενον πρὸς αὐτὸν ὥστε μὴ ἀπανίστασθαι , καὶ ἅμα ταῖς γοῦν ναυσὶ μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον ἐθάρσησε κρατήσειν .
Such were the views which Nicias was positive in stating, from having gained an accurate acquaintance with the state of affairs in Syracuse, and their want of money; and because there were some who were desirous that the state should fall into the hands of the Athenians, and were sending messages to him not to abandon the siege; and at the same time, because he was influenced by confidence in his fleet, at any rate more than before.


7.49.2
5096
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης περὶ μὲν τοῦ προσκαθῆσθαι οὐδ’ ὁπωσοῦν ἐνεδέχετο ·
Demosthenes, however, would not at all listen to the proposal for continuing the siege;


7.49.2
5097
εἰ δὲ δεῖ μὴ ἀπάγειν τὴν στρατιὰν ἄνευ Ἀθηναίων ψηφίσματος , ἀλλὰ τρίβειν αὐτοῦ , ἔφη χρῆναι ἢ ἐς τὴν Θάψον ἀναστάντας τοῦτο ποιεῖν ἢ ἐς τὴν Κατάνην , ὅθεν τῷ τε πεζῷ ἐπὶ πολλὰ τῆς χώρας ἐπιόντες θρέψονται πορθοῦντες τὰ τῶν πολεμίων καὶ ἐκείνους βλάψουσι , ταῖς τε ναυσὶν ἐν πελάγει καὶ οὐκ ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ , ἣ πρὸς τῶν πολεμίων μᾶλλόν ἐστι , τοὺς ἀγῶνας ποιήσονται , ἀλλ’ ἐν εὐρυχωρίᾳ , ἐν ᾗ τά τε τῆς ἐμπειρίας χρήσιμα σφῶν ἔσται καὶ ἀναχωρήσεις καὶ ἐπίπλους οὐκ ἐκ βραχέος καὶ περιγραπτοῦ ὁρμώμενοί τε καὶ καταίροντες ἕξουσιν .
but if it were necessary for them not to withdraw the forces without a decree from the Athenians, but to remain in the country, he said that they should either remove to Thapsus and do so, or to Catana, where they could overrun with their troops a large part of the country, and support themselves by ravaging their enemies' property, and so might injure while at the same time with their fleet they would fight their battles on the open deep, and not in a confined space, which was more in favour of the enemy, but rather with spacious sea-room, where their skill would be of service to them, and they would have an opportunity of retreating and advancing in no narrow and circumscribed space, both on putting out and coming to land.


7.49.3
5098
τό τε ξύμπαν εἰπεῖν , οὐδενὶ τρόπῳ οἱ ἔφη ἀρέσκειν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ἔτι μένειν , ἀλλ’ ὅτι τάχιστα ἤδη ἐξανίστασθαι καὶ μὴ μέλλειν .
In a word, he did not, he said, at all approve of remaining in their present position,


7.49.3
5099
καὶ ὁ Εὐρυμέδων αὐτῷ ταῦτα ξυνηγόρευεν .
but of removing immediately without delay. Eurymedon also supported him in this view.


7.49.4
5100
ἀντιλέγοντος δὲ τοῦ Νικίου ὄκνος τις καὶ μέλλησις ἐνεγένετο καὶ ἅμα ὑπόνοια μή τι καὶ πλέον εἰδὼς ὁ Νικίας ἰσχυρίζηται .
But as Nicias objected to it, a degree of diffidence and hesitation was produced in them,


7.49.4
5101
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ διεμέλλησάν τε καὶ κατὰ χώραν ἔμενον .
and a suspicion also that Nicias might be so positive from knowing something more than he expressed. The Athenians, then, in this way lingered on, and remained where they were.


7.50.1
5102
ὁ δὲ Γύλιππος καὶ ὁ Σικανὸς ἐν τούτῳ παρῆσαν ἐς τὰς Συρακούσας , ὁ μὲν Σικανὸς ἁμαρτὼν τοῦ Ἀκράγαντος ( ἐν Γέλᾳ γὰρ ὄντος αὐτοῦ ἔτι ἡ τοῖς Συρακοσίοις στάσις ἐς φιλία ἐξεπεπτώκει ) ·
In the meantime, Gylippus and Sicanus had come to Syracuse;


7.50.1
5103
ὁ δὲ Γύλιππος ἄλλην τε στρατιὰν πολλὴν ἔχων ἦλθεν ἀπὸ τῆς Σικελίας καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Πελοποννήσου τοῦ ἦρος ἐν ταῖς ὁλκάσιν ὁπλίτας ἀποσταλέντας , ἀφικομένους ἀπὸ τῆς Λιβύης ἐς Σελινοῦντα .
and though Sicanus had failed in winning Acragas, (for while he was still at Gela, the party friendly to the Syracusans had been driven out;) yet Gylippus came with fresh troops raised from the rest of Sicily, and with the heavy-armed which had been sent out from the Peloponnese in the spring, on board the merchantmen, and had arrived at Selinus from Libya.


7.50.2
5104
ἀπενεχθέντες γὰρ ἐς Λιβύην , καὶ δόντων Κυρηναίων τριήρεις δύο καὶ τοῦ πλοῦ ἡγεμόνας , καὶ ἐν τῷ παράπλῳ Εὐεσπερίταις πολιορκουμένοις ὑπὸ Λιβύων ξυμμαχήσαντες καὶ νικήσαντες τοὺς Λίβυς , καὶ αὐτόθεν παραπλεύσαντες ἐς Νέαν πόλιν Καρχηδονιακὸν ἐμπόριον , ὅθενπερ Σικελία ἐλάχιστον δυοῖν ἡμερῶν καὶ νυκτὸς πλοῦν ἀπέχει , καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ περαιωθέντες ἀφίκοντο ἐς Σελινοῦντα .
For when they had been carried by a tempest to Libya, and the Cyrenaeans had given them two triremes, and pilots for their voyage, during their passage along shore they entered into alliance with the Euesperitae, who were being besieged by the Libyans, and defeated the latter people; and after coasting along thence to Neapolis, an emporium of the Carthaginians, from which the distance is shortest to Sicily, namely, a voyage of two days and a night, they crossed over there from that place, and arrived at Selinus.


7.50.3
5105
καὶ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι εὐθὺς αὐτῶν ἐλθόντων παρεσκευάζοντο ὡς ἐπιθησόμενοι κατ’ ἀμφότερα αὖθις τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ ·
Immediately on their arrival, the Syracusans prepared to attack the Athenians again on both sides, by sea and by land.


7.50.3
5106
οἱ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοὶ ὁρῶντες στρατιάν τε ἄλλην προσγεγενημένην αὐτοῖς καὶ τὰ ἑαυτῶν ἅμα οὐκ ἐπὶ τὸ βέλτιον χωροῦντα , ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡμέραν τοῖς πᾶσι χαλεπώτερον ἴσχοντα , μάλιστα δὲ τῇ ἀσθενείᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων πιεζόμενα , μετεμέλοντό τε πρότερον οὐκ ἀναστάντες καὶ ὡς αὐτοῖς οὐδὲ ὁ Νικίας ἔτι ὁμοίως ἐνηντιοῦτο , ἀλλ’ ἢ μὴ φανερῶς γε ἀξιῶν ψηφίζεσθαι , προεῖπον ὡς ἐδύναντο ἀδηλότατα ἔκπλουν ἐκ τοῦ στρατοπέδου πᾶσι , καὶ παρασκευάσασθαι ὅταν τις σημήνῃ .
When the Athenian generals, on the other hand, saw that a fresh force had joined them, and that their own circumstances at the same time were not improving, but were daily becoming worse, and most especially were depressed through the sickness of the men, they repented of not having removed before. And as even Nicias did not now oppose them in the same degree, except by begging them not openly to vote on the question, they gave orders, as secretly as they could, for all to sail out of their station, and to be ready when the signal should be given.


7.50.4
5107
καὶ μελλόντων αὐτῶν , ἐπειδὴ ἑτοῖμα ἦν , ἀποπλεῖν ἡ σελήνη ἐκλείπει ·
And when, after all was in readiness, they were on the point of sailing away, the moon was eclipsed;


7.50.4
5108
ἐτύγχανε γὰρ πασσέληνος οὖσα .
for it happened to be at the full.


7.50.4
5109
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι οἵ τε πλείους ἐπισχεῖν ἐκέλευον τοὺς στρατηγοὺς ἐνθύμιον ποιούμενοι , καὶ ὁ Νικίας ( ἦν γάρ τι καὶ ἄγαν θειασμῷ τε καὶ τῷ τοιούτῳ προσκείμενος ) οὐδ’ ἂν διαβουλεύσασθαι ἔτι ἔφη πρίν , ὡς οἱ μάντεις ἐξηγοῦντο , τρὶς ἐννέα ἡμέρας μεῖναι , ὅπως ἂν πρότερον κινηθείη .
The greater part therefore of the Athenians urged the generals to stop, regarding the matter with religious scruple; and Nicias (for he was somewhat over addicted to superstition, and such feelings,) declared that he would not now so much as consider the matter, with a view to moving, until, as the soothsayers directed, he had waited thrice nine days.


7.50.4
5110
καὶ τοῖς μὲν Ἀθηναίοις μελλήσασι διὰ τοῦτο ἡ μονὴ ἐγεγένητο .
And so the Athenians, having been stopped on this account, remained in the country.


7.51.1
5111
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι καὶ αὐτοὶ τοῦτο πυθόμενοι πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐπηρμένοι ἦσαν μὴ ἀνιέναι τὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὡς καὶ αὐτῶν κατεγνωκότων ἤδη μηκέτι κρεισσόνων εἶναι σφῶν μήτε ταῖς ναυσὶ μήτε τῷ πεζῷ ( οὐ γὰρ ἂν τὸν ἔκπλουν ἐπιβουλεῦσαι ) , καὶ ἅμα οὐ βουλόμενοι αὐτοὺς ἄλλοσέ ποι τῆς Σικελίας καθεζομένους χαλεπωτέρους εἶναι προσπολεμεῖν , ἀλλ’ αὐτοῦ ὡς τάχιστα καὶ ἐν ᾧ σφίσι ξυμφέρει ἀναγκάσαι αὐτοὺς ναυμαχεῖν .
When the Syracusans, too, heard this, they were much more stimulated not to relax in their efforts against the Athenians, since they themselves had now confessed that they were no longer their superiors, either by sea or by land, (for they would not else have meditated sailing away;) and at the same time, because they did not wish them to go and settle in any other part of Sicily, and so to be more difficult to make war upon;


7.51.2
5112
τὰς οὖν ναῦς ἐπλήρουν καὶ ἀνεπειρῶντο ἡμέρας ὅσαι αὐτοῖς ἐδόκουν ἱκαναὶ εἶναι .
They manned their ships therefore, and practised as many days as they thought sufficient.


7.51.2
5113
ἐπειδὴ δὲ καιρὸς ἦν , τῇ μὲν προτέρᾳ πρὸς τὰ τείχη τῶν Ἀθηναίων προσέβαλλον , καὶ ἐπεξελθόντος μέρους τινὸς οὐ πολλοῦ καὶ τῶν ὁπλιτῶν καὶ τῶν ἱππέων κατά τινας πύλας ἀπολαμβάνουσί τε τῶν ὁπλιτῶν τινὰς καὶ τρεψάμενοι καταδιώκουσιν ·
And when a favourable opportunity presented itself, on the first day they assaulted the Athenian lines; and a small division of their heavy-armed and horse having sallied forth against them through certain gateways, they intercepted some of the heavy-armed, and routed and pursued them back.


7.51.2
5114
οὔσης δὲ στενῆς τῆς ἐσόδου οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἵππους τε ἑβδομήκοντα ἀπολλύασι καὶ τῶν ὁπλιτῶν οὐ πολλούς .
And as the entrance was narrow, the Athenians lost seventy horses, and some few heavy-armed.


7.52.1
5115
καὶ ταύτῃ μὲν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπεχώρησεν ἡ στρατιὰ τῶν Συρακοσίων ·
On that day, then, the army of the Syracusans drew off;


7.52.1
5116
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ταῖς τε ναυσὶν ἐκπλέουσιν οὔσαις ἓξ καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ τῷ πεζῷ ἅμα πρὸς τὰ τείχη ἐχώρουν .
but on the next they both sailed out with their ships, seventy-six in number, and at the same time advanced with their troops against the walls.


7.52.1
5117
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀντανῆγον ναυσὶν ἓξ καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ προσμείξαντες ἐναυμάχουν .
The Athenians put out to meet them with eighty-six ships, and closed and fought with them.


7.52.2
5118
καὶ τὸν Εὐρυμέδοντα ἔχοντα τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ βουλόμενον περικλῄσασθαι τὰς ναῦς τῶν ἐναντίων καὶ ἐπεξάγοντα τῷ πλῷ πρὸς τὴν γῆν μᾶλλον , νικήσαντες οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι τὸ μέσον πρῶτον τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπολαμβάνουσι κ- ἐκεῖνον ἐν τῷ κοίλῳ καὶ μυχῷ τοῦ λιμένος καὶ αὐτόν τε διαφθείρουσι καὶ τὰς μετ’ αὐτοῦ ναῦς ἐπισπομένας ·
Now when Eurymedon, who commanded the right wing of the Athenians, and wished to surround the ships of the enemy, had sailed out from the line too much towards the shore;


7.52.2
5119
ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τὰς πάσας ἤδη ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων κατεδίωκόν τε καὶ ἐξεώθουν ἐς τὴν γῆν .
the Syracusans and their allies, after first defeating the centre of the Athenians, intercepted also in the bottom and furthest recess of the harbour, and both killed him, and destroyed the ships that were following him. After which the Syracusans closely pursued all the ships of the Athenians, and drove them ashore.


7.53.1
5120
ὁ δὲ Γύλιππος ὁρῶν τὰς ναῦς τῶν πολεμίων νικωμένας καὶ ἔξω τῶν σταυρωμάτων καὶ τοῦ ἑαυτῶν στρατοπέδου καταφερομένας , βουλόμενος διαφθείρειν τοὺς ἐκβαίνοντας καὶ τὰς ναῦς ῥᾷον τοὺς Συρακοσίους ἀφέλκειν τῆς γῆς φιλίας οὔσης , παρεβοήθει ἐπὶ τὴν χηλὴν μέρος τι ἔχων τῆς στρατιᾶς .
When Gylippus saw the enemy's ships defeated, and carried beyond the stockades and their own station, wishing to cut off the men that were landing from them, and that the Syracusans might more easily tow off the vessels, through the land being in possession of their friends, he ran down to meet them at the break-water with some part of his army.


7.53.2
5121
καὶ αὐτοὺς οἱ Τυρσηνοί ( οὗτοι γὰρ ἐφύλασσον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ταύτῃ ) ὁρῶντες ἀτάκτως προσφερομένους , ἐπεκβοηθήσαντες καὶ προσπεσόντες τοῖς πρώτοις τρέπουσι καὶ ἐσβάλλουσιν ἐς τὴν λίμνην τὴν Λυσιμέλειαν καλουμένην .
The Tyrrhenians (for it was they who were keeping guard at this point) seeing them coming on in disorder, advanced towards them, and fell upon and routed their van, and drove them into what was called the marsh of Lysimelea.


7.53.3
5122
ὕστερον δὲ πλέονος ἤδη τοῦ στρατεύματος παρόντος τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ξυμμάχων καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπιβοηθήσαντες καὶ δείσαντες περὶ ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐς μάχην τε κατέστησαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ νικήσαντες ἐπεδίωξαν καὶ ὁπλίτας τε οὐ πολλοὺς ἀπέκτειναν καὶ τὰς ναῦς τὰς μὲν πολλὰς διέσωσάν τε καὶ ξυνήγαγον κατὰ τὸ στρατόπεδον , δυοῖν δὲ δεούσας εἴκοσιν οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἔλαβον αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας πάντας ἀπέκτειναν .
Afterwards, when the force of the Syracusans and their allies had now come up in greater numbers, the Athenians also advanced against them, being afraid for their ships, and entered into action with them, and defeated and pursued them to some distance, killing a few heavy-armed. They saved also the greater part of their own ships, and brought them together alongside their station; eighteen of them, however, the Syracusans and their allies captured, and put all the men to the sword.


7.53.4
5123
καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς λοιπὰς ἐμπρῆσαι βουλόμενοι ὁλκάδα παλαιὰν κληματίδων καὶ δᾳδὸς γεμίσαντες ( ἦν γὰρ ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ὁ ἄνεμος οὔριος ) ἀφεῖσαν τὴν ναῦν πῦρ ἐμβαλόντες .
Wishing also to burn the rest of them, they filled an old merchantman with faggots and pine-wood, and having thrown fire into it, and the wind blowing right on the Athenians, they let the vessel drift towards them.


7.53.4
5124
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι δείσαντες περὶ ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀντεμηχανήσαντό τε σβεστήρια κωλύματα καὶ παύσαντες τήν τε φλόγα καὶ τὸ μὴ προσελθεῖν ἐγγὺς τὴν ὁλκάδα τοῦ κινδύνου ἀπηλλάγησαν .
The Athenians, alarmed for their ships, contrived, on the other hand, means for checking and extinguishing it; and having stopped the flames and the near approach of the merchantman, they thus escaped the danger.


7.54.1
5125
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο Συρακόσιοι μὲν τῆς τε ναυμαχίας τροπαῖον ἔστησαν καὶ τῆς ἄνω τῆς πρὸς τῷ τείχει ἀπολήψεως τῶν ὁπλιτῶν , ὅθεν καὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἔλαβον , Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ ἧς τε οἱ Τυρσηνοὶ τροπῆς ἐποιήσαντο τῶν πεζῶν ἐς τὴν λίμνην καὶ ἧς αὐτοὶ τῷ ἄλλῳ στρατοπέδῳ .
After this, the Syracusans erected a trophy, both for their sea-fight, and for the interception of the heavy-armed above, at the wall, where they als took the horses; while the Athenians did the same for the rout of those of the infantry whom the Tyrrhenians drove into the marsh, and for that which they themselves effected with the rest of their army.


7.55.1
5126
γεγενημένης δὲ τῆς νίκης τοῖς Συρακοσίοις λαμπρᾶς ἤδη καὶ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ ( πρότερον μὲν γὰρ ἐφοβοῦντο τὰς μετὰ τοῦ Δημοσθένους ναῦς ἐπελθούσας ) οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν παντὶ δὴ ἀθυμίας ἦσαν καὶ ὁ παράλογος αὐτοῖς μέγας ἦν , πολὺ δὲ μείζων ἔτι τῆς στρατείας ὁ μετάμελος .
When the victory had now been so decisive on the side of the Syracusans, even at sea, (for before this they were afraid of the ships newly come with Demosthenes,) the Athenians were in a state of utter despondency; and great was their disappointment, but far greater still their regret, for having made the expedition. For these were the only states they had hitherto attacked with institutions similar to their own, and living under a democracy like themselves;


7.55.2
5127
πόλεσι γὰρ ταύταις μόναις ἤδη ὁμοιοτρόποις ἐπελθόντες , δημοκρατουμέναις τε , ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτοί , καὶ ναῦς καὶ ἵππους καὶ μεγέθη ἐχούσαις , οὐ δυνάμενοι ἐπενεγκεῖν οὔτ’ ἐκ πολιτείας τι μεταβολῆς τὸ διάφορον αὐτοῖς , ᾧ προσήγοντο ἄν , οὔτ’ ἐκ παρασκευῆς πολλῷ κρείσσονος , σφαλλόμενοι δὲ τὰ πλείω , τά τε πρὸ αὐτῶν ἠπόρουν , καὶ ἐπειδή γε καὶ ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐκρατήθησαν , ὃ οὐκ ἂν ᾤοντο , πολλῷ δὴ μᾶλλον ἔτι .
possessing, too, ships, and horses, and greatness: and as they were not able either to introduce any change, as regarded their government, to create dissension among them, by which they might have been brought over, nor to effect that by means of their forces, (though they were far superior,) but had failed in most of their attempts, they were even before this event in perplexity; and after they were defeated even at sea, which they could never have expected, they were far more so still.


7.56.1
5128
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι τόν τε λιμένα εὐθὺς παρέπλεον ἀδεῶς καὶ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ διενοοῦντο κλῄσειν , ὅπως μηκέτι , μηδ’ εἰ βούλοιντο , λάθοιεν αὐτοὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐκπλεύσαντες .
The Syracusans, on the other hand, immediately began to sail without fear along the harbour, and determined to close up its mouth, that the Athenians might not in future sail out, even if they wished it, unobserved by them.


7.56.2
5129
οὐ γὰρ περὶ τοῦ αὐτοὶ σωθῆναι μόνον ἔτι τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν ἐποιοῦντο , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅπως ἐκείνους κωλύσουσι , νομίζοντες ὅπερ ἦν , ἀπό τε τῶν παρόντων πολὺ σφῶν καθυπέρτερα τὰ πράγματα εἶναι καί , εἰ δύναιντο κρατῆσαι Ἀθηναίων τε καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν , καλὸν σφίσιν ἐς τοὺς Ἕλληνας τὸ ἀγώνισμα φανεῖσθαι ·
For they were no longer attending to their own preservation merely, but also to the prevention of the enemy's escape; thinking (as was the fact) that with their present resources their own cause was decidedly the stronger;


7.56.2
5130
τούς τε γὰρ ἄλλους Ἕλληνας εὐθὺς τοὺς μὲν ἐλευθεροῦσθαι , τοὺς δὲ φόβου ἀπολύεσθαι ( οὐ γὰρ ἔτι δυνατὴν ἔσεσθαι τὴν ὑπόλοιπον Ἀθηναίων δύναμιν τὸν ὕστερον ἐπενεχθησόμενον πόλεμον ἐνεγκεῖν ) , καὶ αὐτοὶ δόξαντες αὐτῶν αἴτιοι εἶναι ὑπό τε τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ἔπειτα πολὺ θαυμασθήσεσθαι .
and that if they could conquer the Athenians and their allies both by land and sea, the victory would appear a glorious one for them in the eyes of the Greeks. For of the rest of the Greeks some in that case were straight way liberated, and others released from fear, (as the remaining power of the Athenians would no longer be able to bear the war that would afterwards be waged against them;) while they themselves also, being regarded as the authors of this, would be greatly admired, both by the rest of the world, and by posterity.


7.56.3
5131
καὶ ἦν δὲ ἄξιος ὁ ἀγὼν κατά τε ταῦτα καὶ ὅτι οὐχὶ Ἀθηναίων μόνον περιεγίγνοντο , ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων πολλῶν ξυμμάχων , καὶ οὐδ’ αὐτοὶ αὖ μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ μετὰ τῶν ξυμβοηθησάντων σφίσιν , ἡγεμόνες τε γενόμενοι μετὰ Κορινθίων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ τὴν σφετέραν πόλιν ἐμπαρασχόντες προκινδυνεῦσαί τε καὶ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ μέγα μέρος προκόψαντες .
And the contest was indeed worth encountering, both on these grounds, and because they were winning the victory, not only over the Athenians, but over the other numerous allies also; and, again, not winning it by themselves, but also in company with those who had joined in assisting them; having taken the lead, too, with the Corinthians and Lacedaemonians, and given their own city to stand the first brunt of the danger, and paved the way, in great measure, for their naval success.


7.56.4
5132
ἔθνη γὰρ πλεῖστα δὴ ἐπὶ μίαν πόλιν ταύτην ξυνῆλθε , πλήν γε δὴ τοῦ ξύμπαντος λόγου τοῦ ἐν τῷδε τῷ πολέμῳ πρὸς τὴν Ἀθηναίων τε πόλιν καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων .
For the greatest number of nations met together at this single city, excepting the whole sum of the confederates assembled, during the war, at the city of Athens or of Lacedaemon.

5133
τοσοίδε γὰρ ἑκάτεροι ἐπὶ Σικελίαν τε καὶ περὶ Σικελίας , τοῖς μὲν ξυγκτησόμενοι τὴν χώραν ἐλθόντες , τοῖς δὲ ξυνδιασώσοντες , ἐπὶ Συρακούσας ἐπολέμησαν , οὐ κατὰ δίκην τι μᾶλλον οὐδὲ κατὰ ξυγγένειαν μετ’ ἀλλήλων στάντες , ἀλλ’ ὡς ἑκάστοις τῆς ξυντυχίας ἢ κατὰ τὸ ξυμφέρον ἢ ἀνάγκῃ ἔσχεν .
For the following were the states on each side that repaired to Syracuse for the war, coming against Sicily, or in its behalf, to assist the one side in winning, and the other in keeping possession of the country; taking their stand with one another, not so much on the ground of right, or of kindred, but as they were each circumstanced with respect either to expediency or to necessity.


7.57.2
5134
Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν αὐτοὶ Ἴωνες ἐπὶ Δωριᾶς Συρακοσίους ἑκόντες ἦλθον , καὶ αὐτοῖς τῇ αὐτῇ φωνῇ καὶ νομίμοις ἔτι χρώμενοι Λήμνιοι καὶ Ἴμβριοι καὶ Αἰγινῆται , οἳ τότε Αἴγιναν εἶχον , καὶ ἔτι Ἑστιαιῆς οἱ ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ Ἑστίαιαν οἰκοῦντες ἄποικοι ὄντες ξυνεστράτευσαν .
The Athenians themselves went willingly, as Ionians against the Dorians of Syracuse; and with them went, as their colonists, having the same language and institutions as themselves, the Lemnians, Imbrians, and Aeginetans, who then occupied Aegina; as also the Hestiaeans, who inhabited Hestiaea, in Boeotia. Of the rest, some were serving with them as subjects;


7.57.3
5135
τῶν δ’ ἄλλων οἱ μὲν ὑπήκοοι ,οἱ δ’ ἀπὸ ξυμμαχίας αὐτόνομοι , εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ οἳ μισθοφόροι ξυνεστράτευον .
others in consequence of their alliance, although independent; and others as mercenaries. Amongst their subjects and tributaries were the Eretrians, Chalcidians, Styrians, and Carystians, of Euboea.


7.57.4
5136
καὶ τῶν μὲν ὑπηκόων καὶ φόρου ὑποτελῶν Ἐρετριῆς καὶ Χαλκιδῆς καὶ Στυρῆς καὶ Καρύστιοι ἀπ’ Εὐβοίας ἦσαν , ἀπὸ δὲ νήσων Κεῖοι καὶ Ἄνδριοι καὶ Τήνιοι , ἐκ δ’ Ἰωνίας Μιλήσιοι καὶ Σάμιοι καὶ Χῖοι .
From the islands were the Ceans, Andrians, and Tenians: from Ionia, the Milesians, Samnians, and Chians.


7.57.4
5137
τούτων Χῖοι οὐχ ὑποτελεῖς ὄντες φόρου , ναῦς δὲ παρέχοντες αὐτόνομοι ξυνέσποντο .
Of these, the Chians joined as independent allies, not being subject to tribute, but supplying ships.


7.57.4
5138
καὶ τὸ πλεῖστον Ἴωνες ὄντες οὗτοι πάντες καὶ ἀπ’ Ἀθηναίων πλὴν Καρυστίων ( οὗτοι δ’ εἰσὶ Δρύοπες ) , ὑπήκοοι δ’ ὄντες καὶ ἀνάγκῃ ὅμως Ἴωνές γε ἐπὶ Δωριᾶς ἠκολούθουν .
All these were chiefly Ionians, and descended from the Athenians, except the Carystians, who were Dryopes; and though subject, and going from necessity, still they followed at any rate as Ionians against Dorians.


7.57.5
5139
πρὸς δ’ αὐτοῖς Αἰολῆς , Μηθυμναῖοι μὲν ναυσὶ καὶ οὐ φόρῳ ὑπήκοοι , Τενέδιοι δὲ καὶ Αἴνιοι ὑποτελεῖς .
But the Plataeans alone fought as Boeotians right in the face of Boeotians, as might have been expected, for the hatred they bore them.


7.57.5
5140
οὗτοι δὲ Αἰολῆς Αἰολεῦσι τοῖς κτίσασι Βοιωτοῖς τοῖς μετὰ Συρακοσίων κατ’ ἀνάγκην ἐμάχοντο , Πλαταιῆς δὲ καταντικρὺ Βοιωτοὶ Βοιωτοῖς μόνοι εἰκότως κατὰ τὸ ἔχθος .
Of Rhodians and Cytherians, again, both of Doric race, the Cytherians, though colonists of the Lacedaemonians, were fighting in concert with the Athenians against the Lacedaemonians with Gylippus;


7.57.6
5141
Ῥόδιοι δὲ καὶ Κυθήριοι Δωριῆς ἀμφότεροι , οἱ μὲν Λακεδαιμονίων ἄποικοι Κυθήριοι ἐπὶ Λακεδαιμονίους τοὺς ἅμα Γυλίππῳ μετ’ Ἀθηναίων ὅπλα ἔφερον , Ῥόδιοι δὲ Ἀργεῖοι γένος Συρακοσίοις μὲν Δωριεῦσι , Γελῴοις δὲ καὶ ἀποίκοις ἑαυτῶν οὖσι μετὰ Συρακοσίων στρατευομένοις ἠναγκάζοντο πολεμεῖν .
while the Rhodians, who were Argives by race, were compelled to wage war against the Syracusans, who were Dorians, and the Geloans, who were even their own colonists, serving with the Syracusans. Of the islanders around the Peloponnese, the Cephallenians and Zacynthians followed, indeed, as independent allies, but still, on account of their insular position, rather by constraint, because the Athenians commanded the sea.


7.57.7
5142
τῶν τε περὶ Πελοπόννησον νησιωτῶν Κεφαλλῆνες μὲν καὶ Ζακύνθιοι αὐτόνομοι μέν , κατὰ δὲ τὸ νησιωτικὸν μᾶλλον κατειργόμενοι , ὅτι θαλάσσης ἐκράτουν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ξυνείποντο ·
The Corcyraeans, though not only Dorians but even Corinthians, followed openly against the Corinthians and Syracusans, though colonists of the one and kinsmen of the other;


7.57.7
5143
Κερκυραῖοι δὲ οὐ μόνον Δωριῆς , ἀλλὰ καὶ Κορίνθιοι σαφῶς ἐπὶ Κορινθίους τε καὶ Συρακοσίους , τῶν μὲν ἄποικοι ὄντες , τῶν δὲ ξυγγενεῖς , ἀνάγκῃ μὲν ἐκ τοῦ εὐπρεποῦς , βουλήσει δὲ κατὰ ἔχθος τὸ Κορινθίων οὐχ ἧσσον εἵποντο .
by compulsion, according to their specious profession, but rather with good will, for the hatred they bore the Corinthians. The Messenians, too, as they are now called, at Naupactus, and also from Pylus, which was then held by the Athenians, were taken to the war. Moreover, some few Megarean exiles, owing to their misfortune, were fighting against the Selinuntines, who were Megareans.


7.57.8
5144
καὶ οἱ Μεσσήνιοι νῦν καλούμενοι ἐκ Ναυπάκτου καὶ ἐκ Πύλου τότε ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων ἐχομένης ἐς τὸν πόλεμον παρελήφθησαν .
Of the rest the service was now more of a voluntary nature.


7.57.8
5145
καὶ ἔτι Μεγαρέων φυγάδες οὐ πολλοὶ Μεγαρεῦσι Σελινουντίοις οὖσι κατὰ ξυμφορὰν ἐμάχοντο .
For it was not so much on account of their alliance, as out of hatred for the Lacedaemonians, and for their own individual advantage at the moment, that the Argives followed in company of the Ionian Athenians to fight as Dorians against Dorians.


7.57.9
5146
τῶν δὲ ἄλλων ἑκούσιος μᾶλλον ἡ στρατεία ἐγίγνετο ἤδη .
While the Mantineans, and other mercenaries from Arcadia, went as being accustomed to go against the enemies who at any time were pointed out to them;


7.57.9
5147
Ἀργεῖοι μὲν γὰρ οὐ τῆς ξυμμαχίας ἕνεκα μᾶλλον ἢ τῆς Λακεδαιμονίων τε ἔχθρας καὶ τῆς παραυτίκα ἕκαστοι ἰδίας ὠφελίας Δωριῆς ἐπὶ Δωριᾶς μετὰ Ἀθηναίων Ἰώνων ἠκολούθουν , Μαντινῆς δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι Ἀρκάδων μισθοφόροι ἐπὶ τοὺς αἰεὶ πολεμίους σφίσιν ἀποδεικνυμένους ἰέναι εἰωθότες καὶ τότε τοὺς μετὰ Κορινθίων ἐλθόντας Ἀρκάδας οὐδὲν ἧσσον διὰ κέρδος ἡγούμενοι πολεμίους , Κρῆτες δὲ καὶ Αἰτωλοὶ μισθῷ καὶ οὗτοι πεισθέντες ·
and thought, for the sake of gain, that the Arcadians, who at that time came with the Corinthians, were no less than others their foes. The Cretans and Aetolians also came for consideration of pay;


7.57.9
5148
ξυνέβη δὲ τοῖς Κρησὶ τὴν Γέλαν Ῥοδίοις ξυγκτίσαντας μὴ ξὺν τοῖς ἀποίκοις , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποίκους ἑκόντας μετὰ μισθοῦ ἐλθεῖν .
and it happened in the case of the Cretans, that although they had joined the Rhodians in founding Gela, they now came, not their colonists, but them—not by choice, but for pay. There were also some Acarnanians who served as auxiliaries, partly from motives of interest, but mainly as being allies, through their friendship with Demosthenes, and their good-will towards the Athenians.


7.57.10
5149
καὶ Ἀκαρνάνων τινὲς ἅμα μὲν κέρδει , τὸ δὲ πλέον Δημοσθένους φιλίᾳ καὶ Ἀθηναίων εὐνοίᾳ ξύμμαχοι ὄντες ἐπεκούρησαν .
These, then, were within the boundary of the Ionian gulf.


7.57.11
5150
καὶ οἵδε μὲν τῷ Ἰονίῳ κόλπῳ ὁριζόμενοι ·
Of the Italiots, on the other hand, the Thurians and Metapontines, as they had been overtaken by such necessities at that time, owing to those seasons of faction, joined in the expedition;


7.57.11
5151
Ἰταλιωτῶν δὲ Θούριοι καὶ Μεταπόντιοι ἐν τοιαύταις ἀνάγκαις τότε στασιωτικῶν καιρῶν κατειλημμένοι ξυνεστράτευον , καὶ Σικελιωτῶν Νάξιοι καὶ Καταναῖοι , βαρβάρων δὲ Ἐγεσταῖοί τε , οἵπερ ἐπηγάγοντο , καὶ Σικελῶν τὸ πλέον , καὶ τῶν ἔξω Σικελίας Τυρσηνῶν τέ τινες κατὰ διαφορὰν Συρακοσίων καὶ Ἰάπυγες μισθοφόροι .
and of the Siceliots, the Naxians and Catanians. Of barbarians, there were the Segestans, who indeed invited them to their aid, with the greater part of the Sicels; and of those out of Sicily, some of the Tyrrhenians, on account of a quarrel with the Syracusans, and some lapygian mercenaries.


7.57.11
5152
τοσάδε μὲν μετὰ Ἀθηναίων ἔθνη ἐστράτευον .
Such and so many were the nations that were serving with the Athenians.


7.58.1
5153
Συρακοσίοις δὲ ἀντεβοήθησαν Καμαριναῖοι μὲν ὅμοροι ὄντες καὶ Γελῷοι οἰκοῦντες μετ’ αὐτούς , ἔπειτα Ἀκραγαντίνων ἡσυχαζόντων ἐν τῷ ἐπ’ ἐκεῖνα ἱδρυμένοι Σελινούντιοι .
To the aid of the Syracusans, on the other hand, came the Camarinaeans, who lived on their borders; the Geloans, who lived next to them;


7.58.2
5154
καὶ οἵδε μὲν τῆς Σικελίας τὸ πρὸς Λιβύην μέρος τετραμμένον νεμόμενοι , Ἱμεραῖοι δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ πρὸς τὸν Τυρσηνικὸν πόντον μορίου , ἐν ᾧ καὶ μόνοι Ἕλληνες οἰκοῦσιν ·
and then (for the Acragantines were neutral) the Selinuntines, who were situated on the farther side of the island.


7.58.2
5155
οὗτοι δὲ καὶ ἐξ αὐτοῦ μόνοι ἐβοήθησαν .
These occupied the part of Sicily opposite to Libya, but the Himeraeans the side towards the Tyrrhenian sea, in which they are the only Greek inhabitants, and from which they were the only auxiliaries of the Syracusans.


7.58.3
5156
καὶ Ἑλληνικὰ μὲν ἔθνη τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ τοσάδε , Δωριῆς τε καὶ οἱ αὐτόνομοι πάντες , ξυνεμάχουν , βαρβάρων δὲ Σικελοὶ μόνοι ὅσοι μὴ ἀφέστασαν πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ·
Such then were the Grecian communities in Sicily that joined in the war, being all Dorians and independent.


7.58.3
5157
τῶν δ’ ἔξω Σικελίας Ἑλλήνων Λακεδαιμόνιοι μὲν ἡγεμόνα Σπαρτιάτην παρεχόμενοι , νεοδαμώδεις δὲ τοὺς ἄλλους καὶ Εἵλωτας δύναται δὲ τὸ νεοδαμῶδες ἐλεύθερον ἤδη εἶναι , Κορίνθιοι δὲ καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ μόνοι παραγενόμενοι καὶ Λευκάδιοι καὶ Ἀμπρακιῶται κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενές , ἐκ δὲ Ἀρκαδίας μισθοφόροι ὑπὸ Κορινθίων ἀποσταλέντες καὶ Σικυώνιοι ἀναγκαστοὶ στρατεύοντες , καὶ τῶν ἔξω Πελοποννήσου Βοιωτοί .
Of the barbarians, there were the Sicels alone, such of them as had not gone over to the Athenians. Of the Greeks beyond the limits of Sicily, there were the Lacedaemonians, who supplied a Spartan leader, while the rest of the troops were Neodamodes and Helots; (the term Neodamode being now equivalent to free;) the Corinthians, who alone of all the allies joined with both sea and land forces; the Leucadians, also, and Ambraciots, for the sake of their connexion with them; while mercenaries were sent from Arcadia by the Corinthians, and some Sicyonians, who were pressed into the service. From beyond the Peloponnese, some Boeotians joined them.


7.58.4
5158
πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ἐπελθόντας τούτους οἱ Σικελιῶται αὐτοὶ πλῆθος πλέον κατὰ πάντα παρέσχοντο ἅτε μεγάλας πόλεις οἰκοῦντες ·
Compared, however, with these who came as auxiliaries, the Siceliots themselves supplied larger numbers in every branch of the service, inasmuch as they were powerful states;


7.58.4
5159
καὶ γὰρ ὁπλῖται πολλοὶ καὶ νῆες καὶ ἵπποι καὶ ὁ ἄλλος ὅμιλος ἄφθονος ξυνελέγη .
for numerous heavy-armed, ships, and horses, and an abundant crowd besides, were collected by them.


7.58.4
5160
καὶ πρὸς ἅπαντας αὖθις ὡς εἰπεῖν τοὺς ἄλλους Συρακόσιοι αὐτοὶ πλείω ἐπορίσαντο διὰ μέγεθός τε πόλεως καὶ ὅτι ἐν μεγίστῳ κινδύνῳ ἦσαν .
And compared, again, with all the rest put together, as one may say, the Syracusans by themselves furnished more numerous levies, both from the greatness of their city, and because they were in the greatest peril.


7.59.1
5161
καὶ αἱ μὲν ἑκατέρων ἐπικουρίαι τοσαίδε ξυνελέγησαν , καὶ τότε ἤδη πᾶσαι ἀμφοτέροις παρῆσαν καὶ οὐκέτι οὐδὲν οὐδετέροις ἐπῆλθεν .
Such were the auxiliaries collected on either side, which, by this time, had all joined both parties, and there were no subsequent additions to either.


7.59.2
5162
οἱ δ’ οὖν Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι εἰκότως ἐνόμισαν καλὸν ἀγώνισμα σφίσιν εἶναι ἐπὶ τῇ γεγενημένῃ νίκῃ τῆς ναυμαχίας ἑλεῖν τε τὸ στρατόπεδον ἅπαν τῶν Ἀθηναίων τοσοῦτον ὄν , καὶ μηδὲ καθ’ ἕτερα αὐτούς , μήτε διὰ θαλάσσης μήτε τῷ πεζῷ , διαφυγεῖν .
The Syracusans and their allies, then, reasonably conceived that it would be a glorious prize for them, after their recent victory in the sea-fight, to capture the whole armament of the Athenians, great as it was, and not to let them escape either way, neither by sea nor


7.59.3
5163
ἔκλῃον οὖν τόν τε λιμένα εὐθὺς τὸν μέγαν , ἔχοντα τὸ στόμα ὀκτὼ σταδίων μάλιστα , τριήρεσι πλαγίαις καὶ πλοίοις καὶ ἀκάτοις ἐπ’ ἀγκυρῶν ὁρμίζοντες , καὶ τ- ἄλλα , ἢν ἔτι ναυμαχεῖν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τολμήσωσι , παρεσκευάζοντο , καὶ ὀλίγον οὐδὲν ἐς οὐδὲν ἐπενόουν .
land. They began therefore immediately to close up the great harbour, the mouth of which was about eight stades across, with triremes ranged broadside, and merchant-vessels, and boats, mooring them with anchors; while they prepared every thing else, in case the Athenians should still have courage for a sea-fight, and entertained no small designs with regard to any thing.


7.60.1
5164
τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις τήν τε ἀπόκλῃσιν ὁρῶσι καὶ τὴν ἄλλην διάνοιαν αὐτῶν αἰσθομένοις βουλευτέα ἐδόκει .
The Athenians, seeing them closing up the harbour, and having received intelligence of their other plans, thought it necessary to hold a council.


7.60.2
5165
καὶ ξυνελθόντες οἵ τε στρατηγοὶ καὶ οἱ ταξίαρχοι πρὸς τὴν παροῦσαν ἀπορίαν τῶν τε ἄλλων καὶ ὅτι τὰ ἐπιτήδεια οὔτε αὐτίκα ἔτι εἶχον ( προπέμψαντες γὰρ ἐς Κατάνην ὡς ἐκπλευσόμενοι ἀπεῖπον μὴ ἐπάγειν ) οὔτε τὸ λοιπὸν ἔμελλον ἕξειν , εἰ μὴ ναυκρατήσουσιν , ἐβουλεύσαντο τὰ μὲν τείχη τὰ ἄνω ἐκλιπεῖν , πρὸς δ’ αὐταῖς ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀπολαβόντες διατειχίσματι ὅσον οἷόν τε ἐλάχιστον τοῖς τε σκεύεσι καὶ τοῖς ἀσθενοῦσιν ἱκανὸν γενέσθαι , τοῦτο μὲν φρουρεῖν , ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ ἄλλου πεζοῦ τὰς ναῦς ἁπάσας , ὅσαι ἦσαν καὶ δυναταὶ καὶ ἀπλοώτεραι , πάντα τινὰ ἐσβιβάζοντες πληρῶσαι , καὶ διαναυμαχήσαντες , ἢν μὲν νικῶσιν , ἐς Κατάνην κομίζεσθαι , ἢν δὲ μή , ἐμπρήσαντες τὰς ναῦς πεζῇ ξυνταξάμενοι ἀποχωρεῖν ᾗ ἂν τάχιστα μέλλωσί τινος χωρίου ἢ βαρβαρικοῦ ἢ Ἑλληνικοῦ φιλίου ἀντιλήψεσθαι .
Accordingly the generals and the Taxiarchs assembled to deliberate on their difficulties, arising both from other causes, and especially because they had neither any more provisions for their immediate use, (for, thinking that they were going to sail away, they had sent before to Catana, and commanded them to bring them no longer,) nor were likely to have them in future, unless they should gain the command of the sea. They determined therefore to evacuate the upper part of their lines, and having enclosed with a cross wall just by the ships the least space that could be sufficient to hold their stores and their sick, to garrison that, while with the rest of their troops, making every one go on board, they manned all their ships, both such as were sound and such as were less fit for service; and after a naval engagement, if they were victorious, to proceed to Catana; but if not, to burn their ships, throw themselves into him. and retreat by land, in whatever direction they would soonest reach some friendly town, whether barbarian or Grecian.


7.60.3
5166
καὶ οἱ μέν , ὡς ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς ταῦτα , καὶ ἐποίησαν ·
They, then, having resolved on these things, acted accordingly;


7.60.3
5167
ἔκ τε γὰρ τῶν ἄνω τειχῶν ὑποκατέβησαν καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐπλήρωσαν πάσας , ἀναγκάσαντες ἐσβαίνειν ὅστις καὶ ὁπωσοῦν ἐδόκει ἡλικίας μετέχων ἐπιτήδειος εἶναι .
for they gradually descended from their upper lines, and manned all their ships, having compelled to go on board whoever, even in any degree, seemed of age for rendering service.


7.60.4
5168
καὶ ξυνεπληρώθησαν νῆες αἱ πᾶσαι δέκα μάλιστα καὶ ἑκατόν ·
Thus there were manned in all about a hundred and ten ships;


7.60.4
5169
τοξότας τε ἐπ’ αὐτὰς πολλοὺς καὶ ἀκοντιστὰς τῶν τε Ἀκαρνάνων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ξένων ἐσεβίβαζον , καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὡς οἷόν τ’ ἦν ἐξ ἀναγκαίου τε καὶ τοιαύτης διανοίας ἐπορίσαντο .
on board which they embarked a large number of bow-men and dart-men, taken from the Acarnanian and other mercenaries, and provided everything else, as far as it was possible for them, when acting upon a plan which necessity alone dictated, such as the present.


7.60.5
5170
ὁ δὲ Νικίας , ἐπειδὴ τὰ πολλὰ ἑτοῖμα ἦν , ὁρῶν τοὺς στρατιώτας τῷ τε παρὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς πολὺ ταῖς ναυσὶ κρατηθῆναι ἀθυμοῦντας καὶ διὰ τὴν τῶν ἐπιτηδείων σπάνιν ὡς τάχιστα βουλομένους διακινδυνεύειν , ξυγκαλέσας ἅπαντας παρεκελεύσατό τε πρῶτον καὶ ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
When most things were in readiness, Nicias, seeing the soldiers disheartened by their decided defeat at sea, and wishing, in consequence of the scarcity of provisions, to hazard a final battle as speedily as possible, assembled them, and on that occasion addressed them all together first, and spoke as follows:


7.61.1
5171
&quot; ἄνδρες στρατιῶται Ἀθηναίων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ξυμμάχων , ὁ μὲν ἀγὼν ὁ μέλλων ὁμοίως κοινὸς ἅπασιν ἔσται περί τε σωτηρίας καὶ πατρίδος ἑκάστοις οὐχ ἧσσον ἢ τοῖς πολεμίοις ·
"Soldiers of the Athenians, and of the other allies, the coming struggle will be common alike to all—for the safety and country of each of us, no less than of the enemy;


7.61.1
5172
ἢν γὰρ κρατήσωμεν νῦν ταῖς ναυσίν , ἔστι τῳ τὴν ὑπάρχουσάν που οἰκείαν πόλιν ἐπιδεῖν .
since if we now gain a victory with our fleet, each one may see his native city again, wherever it may be.


7.61.2
5173
ἀθυμεῖν δὲ οὐ χρὴ οὐδὲ πάσχειν ὅπερ οἱ ἀπειρότατοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων , οἳ τοῖς πρώτοις ἀγῶσι σφαλέντες ἔπειτα διὰ παντὸς τὴν ἐλπίδα τοῦ φόβου ὁμοίαν ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς ἔχουσιν .
Nor should you be disheartened, or feel like the most inexperienced of men, who, after failing in their first attempts, ever after have the anticipation of their fear taking the colour of their disasters.


7.61.3
5174
ἀλλ’ ὅσοι τε Ἀθηναίων πάρεστε , πολλῶν ἤδη πολέμων ἔμπειροι ὄντες , καὶ ὅσοι τῶν ξυμμάχων , ξυστρατευόμενοι αἰεί , μνήσθητε τῶν ἐν τοῖς πολέμοις παραλόγων , καὶ τὸ τῆς τύχης κἂν μεθ’ ἡμῶν ἐλπίσαντες στῆναι καὶ ὡς ἀναμαχούμενοι ἀξίως τοῦδε τοῦ πλήθους , ὅσον αὐτοὶ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν ἐφορᾶτε , παρασκευάζεσθε .
But as many of you here as are Athenians, having already had experience in many wars, and all the allies who have ever joined us in our expeditions, remember the unexpected results that occur in warfare; and make your preparations with a hope that fortune may at length side with  and with a determination to renew the conflict in a manner worthy of your numbers, which you see yourselves to be so great.


7.62.1
5175
&quot; ἃ δὲ ἀρωγὰ ἐνείδομεν ἐπὶ τῇ τοῦ λιμένος στενότητι πρὸς τὸν μέλλοντα ὄχλον τῶν νεῶν ἔσεσθαι καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἐκείνων ἐπὶ τῶν καταστρωμάτων παρασκευήν , οἷς πρότερον ἐβλαπτόμεθα , πάντα καὶ ἡμῖν νῦν ἐκ τῶν παρόντων μετὰ τῶν κυβερνητῶν ἐσκεμμένα ἡτοίμασται .
"Now whatever we saw likely to be serviceable against the confined space of the harbour, with reference to the crowd of ships that there will be, and the enemy's troops upon their decks, from which we suffered before, every thing has now been looked to and prepared by us also, as far as present circumstances would allow, with the co-operation of the masters of our vessels.


7.62.2
5176
καὶ γὰρ τοξόται πολλοὶ καὶ ἀκοντισταὶ ἐπιβήσονται καὶ ὄχλος , ᾧ ναυμαχίαν μὲν ποιούμενοι ἐν πελάγει οὐκ ἂν ἐχρώμεθα διὰ τὸ βλάπτειν ἂν τὸ τῆς ἐπιστήμης τῇ βαρύτητι τῶν νεῶν , ἐν δὲ τῇ ἐνθάδε ἠναγκασμένῃ ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν πεζομαχίᾳ πρόσφορα ἔσται .
For great numbers of bow-men and dart-men will go on board, and a multitude such as we should not have used, had we been fighting in the open sea, as it would have interfered with the display of our skill through the weight of our ships; but in the present  which we are compelled to make on board our ships, these things will be of service.


7.62.3
5177
ηὕρηται δ’ ἡμῖν ὅσα χρὴ ἀντιναυπηγῆσαι , καὶ πρὸς τὰς τῶν ἐπωτίδων αὐτοῖς παχύτητας , ᾧπερ δὴ μάλιστα ἐβλαπτόμεθα , χειρῶν σιδηρῶν ἐπιβολαί , αἳ σχήσουσι τὴν πάλιν ἀνάκρουσιν τῆς προσπεσούσης νεώς , ἢν τὰ ἐπὶ τούτοις οἱ ἐπιβάται ὑπουργῶσιν .
We have also ascertained the different ways in which we must adapt the structure of our vessels for opposing theirs, and especially, against the stoutness of their cheeks, from which we received most damage, we have provided grappling irons, which will prevent the ship's retiring again after it has once charged, if the soldiers on board then do their duty.


7.62.4
5178
ἐς τοῦτο γὰρ δὴ ἠναγκάσμεθα ὥστε πεζομαχεῖν ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν , καὶ τὸ μήτε αὐτοὺς ἀνακρούεσθαι μήτ’ ἐκείνους ἐᾶν ὠφέλιμον φαίνεται , ἄλλως τε καὶ τῆς γῆς , πλὴν ὅσον ἂν ὁ πεζὸς ἡμῶν ἐπέχῃ , πολεμίας οὔσης .
For to this necessity are we reduced, that we must maintain a land-fight on board our fleet; and it seems to be our interest neither to retire ourselves, nor to suffer them to do it; especially as the shore, except so far as our troops occupy it, is in possession of the enemy.


7.63.1
5179
&quot; ὧν χρὴ μεμνημένους διαμάχεσθαι ὅσον ἂν δύνησθε καὶ μὴ ἐξωθεῖσθαι ἐς αὐτήν , ἀλλὰ ξυμπεσούσης νηὶ νεὼς μὴ πρότερον ἀξιοῦν ἀπολύεσθαι ἢ τοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ πολεμίου καταστρώματος ὁπλίτας ἀπαράξητε .
"Remembering this, then, you must fight on as long as you can, and not be driven to land, but determine, when one ship has closed with another, not to separate before you have swept off the soldiers from your enemy's deck.


7.63.2
5180
καὶ ταῦτα τοῖς ὁπλίταις οὐχ ἧσσον τῶν ναυτῶν παρακελεύομαι , ὅσῳ τῶν ἄνωθεν μᾶλλον τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο ·
And this exhortation I offer to the soldiers not less than to the sailors, inasmuch as this work belongs more to those upon deck.


7.63.2
5181
ὑπάρχει δ’ ἡμῖν ἔτι νῦν γε τὰ πλείω τῷ πεζῷ ἐπικρατεῖν .
And we have still even now a general superiority with our troops.


7.63.3
5182
τοῖς δὲ ναύταις παραινῶ καὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ τῷδε καὶ δέομαι μὴ ἐκπεπλῆχθαί τι ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς ἄγαν , τήν τε παρασκευὴν ἀπὸ τῶν καταστρωμάτων βελτίω νῦν ἔχοντας καὶ τὰς ναῦς πλείους , ἐκείνην τε τὴν ἡδονὴν ἐνθυμεῖσθαι ὡς ἀξία ἐστὶ διασώσασθαι , οἳ τέως Ἀθηναῖοι νομιζόμενοι καὶ μὴ ὄντες ἡμῶν τῆς τε φωνῆς τῇ ἐπιστήμῃ καὶ τῶν τρόπων τῇ μιμήσει ἐθαυμάζεσθε κατὰ τὴν Ἑλλάδα , καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς τῆς ἡμετέρας οὐκ ἔλασσον κατὰ τὸ ὠφελεῖσθαι ἔς τε τὸ φοβερὸν τοῖς ὑπηκόοις καὶ τὸ μὴ ἀδικεῖσθαι πολὺ πλέον μετείχετε .
On the other hand, I advise the seamen, and entreat them too at the same time, not to be too much dismayed by their misfortunes, as we have now superior resources on our decks, and a larger number of ships. Consider, too, how well worth preserving is that pleasure enjoyed by those of you, who, being hitherto considered as Athenians, even though you are not, from your knowledge of our language and your imitation of our customs, were respected through Greece, and enjoyed no less a share of our empire as regarded the benefits you derived from it, and a far greater share as regards being feared by our subjects, and being secured from injuries.


7.63.4
5183
ὥστε κοινωνοὶ μόνοι ἐλευθέρως ἡμῖν τῆς ἀρχῆς ὄντες δικαίως ἂν αὐτὴν νῦν μὴ καταπροδίδοτε , καταφρονήσαντες δὲ Κορινθίων τε , οὓς πολλάκις νενικήκατε , καὶ Σικελιωτῶν , ὧν οὐδ’ ἀντιστῆναι οὐδεὶς ἕως ἤκμαζε τὸ ναυτικὸν ἡμῖν ἠξίωσεν , ἀμύνασθε αὐτούς , καὶ δείξατε ὅτι καὶ μετ’ ἀσθενείας καὶ ξυμφορῶν ἡ ὑμετέρα ἐπιστήμη κρείσσων ἐστὶν ἑτέρας εὐτυχούσης ῥώμης .
Since then you alone, as free men, share our empire with us, abstain, as just men, from now utterly betraying it. And with contempt for Corinthians, whom you have often conquered, and for Siceliots, none of whom presumed, while our fleet was in fine condition, so much as to stand up against us, repel them, and show that, even when attended by weakness and misfortunes, your skill is superior to the fortunate strength of any others.


7.64.1
5184
τούς τε Ἀθηναίους ὑμῶν πάλιν αὖ καὶ τάδε ὑπομιμνῄσκω , ὅτι οὔτε ναῦς ἐν τοῖς νεωσοίκοις ἄλλας ὁμοίας ταῖσδε οὔτε ὁπλιτῶν ἡλικίαν ὑπελίπετε , εἴ τε ξυμβήσεταί τι ἄλλο ἢ τὸ κρατεῖν ὑμῖν , τούς τε ἐνθάδε πολεμίους εὐθὺς ἐπ’ ἐκεῖνα πλευσομένους καὶ τοὺς ἐκεῖ ὑπολοίπους ἡμῶν ἀδυνάτους ἐσομένους τούς τε αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἐπελθόντας ἀμύνασθαι .
Those of you, again, who are Athenians, I must remind of this also, that you left behind you no more such ships in your docks, nor so fine a body of heavy-armed troops;


7.64.1
5185
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἂν ὑπὸ Συρακοσίοις εὐθὺς γίγνοισθε , οἷς αὐτοὶ ἴστε οἵᾳ γνώμῃ ἐπήλθετε , οἱ δὲ ἐκεῖ ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίοις .
and that if anything else befall you but victory, your enemies here will immediately sail thither, and those of our countrymen who are left behind there will be unable to defend themselves against both their opponents on the spot and those who will join them; and thus at the same time you who are here will be at the mercy of the Syracusans, (and you know with what feelings you came against them,) and those who are there at home at that of the Lacedaemonians."


7.64.2
5186
ὥστε ἐν ἑνὶ τῷδε ὑπὲρ ἀμφοτέρων ἀγῶνι καθεστῶτες καρτερήσατε , εἴπερ ποτέ , καὶ ἐνθυμεῖσθε καθ’ ἑκάστους τε καὶ ξύμπαντες ὅτι οἱ ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶν ὑμῶν νῦν ἐσόμενοι καὶ πεζοὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις εἰσὶ καὶ νῆες καὶ ἡ ὑπόλοιπος πόλις καὶ τὸ μέγα ὄνομα τῶν Ἀθηνῶν , περὶ ὧν , εἴ τίς τι ἕτερος ἑτέρου προφέρει ἢ ἐπιστήμῃ ἢ εὐψυχίᾳ , οὐκ ἂν ἐν ἄλλῳ μᾶλλον καιρῷ ἀποδειξάμενος αὐτός τε αὑτῷ ὠφέλιμος γένοιτο καὶ τοῖς ξύμπασι σωτήριος &quot; .
" Being brought then to this one struggle for both parties, fight bravely now, if you ever did; and reflect, both individually and collectively, that those of you who will now be on board your ships represent both the army and the navy of the Athenians, all that is left of your country, and the great name of Athens: in behalf of which, whatever be the point in which one man excels another, either in science or courage, on no other occasion could he better display it, so as both to benefit himself and to contribute to the preservation of all."


7.65.1
5187
ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοσαῦτα παρακελευσάμενος εὐθὺς ἐκέλευε πληροῦν τὰς ναῦς .
Nicias delivered this exhortation to them, and immediately commanded them to man the ships.


7.65.1
5188
τῷ δὲ Γυλίππῳ καὶ τοῖς Συρακοσίοις παρῆν μὲν αἰσθάνεσθαι , ὁρῶσι καὶ αὐτὴν τὴν παρασκευήν , ὅτι ναυμαχήσουσιν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , προηγγέλθη δ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ ἡ ἐπιβολὴ τῶν σιδηρῶν χειρῶν , καὶ πρός τε τ- ἄλλα ἐξηρτύσαντο ὡς ἕκαστα καὶ πρὸς τοῦτο ·
Gylippus and the Syracusans, on the other hand, were able to perceive, from the sight of their very preparations, that the Athenians were about to engage them at sea, and the device of throwing the grappling irons had also been previously reported to them.


7.65.2
5189
τὰς γὰρ πρῴρας καὶ τῆς νεὼς ἄνω ἐπὶ πολὺ κατεβύρσωσαν , ὅπως ἂν ἀπολισθάνοι καὶ μὴ ἔχοι ἀντιλαβὴν ἡ χεὶρ ἐπιβαλλομένη .
They prepared themselves therefore on all other points severally, and on this also; for they covered over with hides their prows and a considerable space of the upper part of the vessel, so that the grapple, when thrown, might slip off, and not obtain any hold on them.


7.65.3
5190
καὶ ἐπειδὴ πάντα ἑτοῖμα ἦν , παρεκελεύσαντο ἐκείνοις οἵ τε στρατηγοὶ καὶ Γύλιππος καὶ ἔλεξαν τοιάδε .
And now, when every thing was ready, their generals, together with Gylippus, exhorted them by speaking as follows:


7.66.1
5191
&quot; ὅτι μὲν καλὰ τὰ προειργασμένα καὶ ὑπὲρ καλῶν τῶν μελλόντων ὁ ἀγὼν ἔσται , ὦ Συρακόσιοι καὶ ξύμμαχοι , οἵ τε πολλοὶ δοκεῖτε ἡμῖν εἰδέναι ( οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν οὕτως αὐτῶν προθύμως ἀντελάβεσθε ) , καὶ εἴ τις μὴ ἐπὶ ὅσον δεῖ ᾔσθηται , σημανοῦμεν .
"That our former achievements have been glorious ones, Syracusans and allies, and that this struggle will be for glorious results in future, most of you seem to us to be aware, (for you would not else have devoted yourselves so eagerly to it,) and if any one is not as sensible of it as he ought to be, we will prove it to him.


7.66.2
5192
Ἀθηναίους γὰρ ἐς τὴν χώραν τήνδε ἐλθόντας πρῶτον μὲν ἐπὶ τῆς Σικελίας καταδουλώσει , ἔπειτ’ , εἰ κατορθώσειαν , καὶ τῆς Πελοποννήσου καὶ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος , καὶ ἀρχὴν τὴν ἤδη μεγίστην τῶν τε πρὶν Ἑλλήνων καὶ τῶν νῦν κεκτημένους , πρῶτοι ἀνθρώπων ὑποστάντες τῷ ναυτικῷ , ᾧπερ πάντα κατέσχον , τὰς μὲν νενικήκατε ἤδη ναυμαχίας , τὴν δ’ ἐκ τοῦ εἰκότος νῦν νικήσετε .
For when the Athenians had come to this country, for the subjugation of Sicily in the first place, and then, if they succeeded, for that of the Peloponnese also, and the rest of Greece; and when they possessed the largest empire enjoyed hitherto, either by Greeks of former times or of the present, you were the first men in the world who withstood their navy, with which they had borne down every thing, and have already conquered them in some sea-fights, and will now, in all probability, conquer them in this.


7.66.3
5193
ἄνδρες γὰρ ἐπειδὰν ᾧ ἀξιοῦσι προύχειν κολουθῶσι , τό γ’ ὑπόλοιπον αὐτῶν τῆς δόξης ἀσθενέστερον αὐτὸ ἑαυτοῦ ἐστὶν ἢ εἰ μηδ’ ᾠήθησαν τὸ πρῶτον , καὶ τῷ παρ’ ἐλπίδα τοῦ αὐχήματος σφαλλόμενοι καὶ παρὰ ἰσχὺν τῆς δυνάμεως ἐνδιδόασιν ·
For when men have been put down in that in which they claim to excel, their opinion of themselves in future is far lower than if they had never entertained such an idea at first;


7.66.3
5194
ὃ νῦν Ἀθηναίους εἰκὸς πεπονθέναι .
and failing through the disappointment of their boasting, they give way even beyond the degree of their power. And such, probably, is now the feeling of the Athenians.


7.67.1
5195
ἡμῶν δὲ τό τε ὑπάρχον πρότερον , ᾧπερ καὶ ἀνεπιστήμονες ἔτι ὄντες ἀπετολμήσαμεν , βεβαιότερον νῦν , καὶ τῆς δοκήσεως προσγεγενημένης αὐτῷ , τὸ κρατίστους εἶναι εἰ τοὺς κρατίστους ἐνικήσαμεν , διπλασία ἑκάστου ἡ ἐλπίς ·
"But in our case, both the opinion we entertained before, and with which, even while we were yet unskilful, we were full of daring, has now been confirmed;


7.67.1
5196
τὰ δὲ πολλὰ πρὸς τὰς ἐπιχειρήσεις ἡ μεγίστη ἐλπὶς μεγίστην καὶ τὴν προθυμίαν παρέχεται .
and from the addition to it of the thought that we must be the best seamen in the world, since we have conquered the best, each man's hope is doubled. And, generally speaking, it is the greatest hope that supplies also the greatest spirit for undertakings.


7.67.2
5197
&quot; τά τε τῆς ἀντιμιμήσεως αὐτῶν τῆς παρασκευῆς ἡμῶν τῷ μὲν ἡμετέρῳ τρόπῳ ξυνήθη τέ ἐστι καὶ οὐκ ἀνάρμοστοι πρὸς ἕκαστον αὐτῶν ἐσόμεθα ·
Again, those points in which they are imitating our equipments are familiar to our habits, and we shall not be awkward at each of them:


7.67.2
5198
οἱ δ’ , ἐπειδὰν πολλοὶ μὲν ὁπλῖται ἐπὶ τῶν καταστρωμάτων παρὰ τὸ καθεστηκὸς ὦσι , πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ ἀκοντισταὶ χερσαῖοι ὡς εἰπεῖν Ἀκαρνᾶνές τε καὶ ἄλλοι ἐπὶ ναῦς ἀναβάντες , οἳ οὐδ’ ὅπως καθεζομένους χρὴ τὸ βέλος ἀφεῖναι εὑρήσουσι , πῶς οὐ σφαλοῦσί τε τὰς ναῦς καὶ ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς πάντες οὐκ ἐν τῷ ἑαυτῶν τρόπῳ κινούμενοι ταράξονται ;
whereas, on their side, when many soldiers are on their decks contrary to their custom, and many dart-men, mere land-lubbers, (so to speak,) Acarnanians and others, have gone on board their ships, who will not so much as know how to discharge their weapons while stationary, how can they avoid swaying the ships, and falling all into confusion amongst themselves, by not moving according to their own fashion?


7.67.3
5199
ἐπεὶ καὶ τῷ πλήθει τῶν νεῶν οὐκ ὠφελήσονται , εἴ τις καὶ τόδε ὑμῶν , ὅτι οὐκ ἴσαις ναυμαχήσει , πεφόβηται ·
For neither will they derive any benefit from the superior number of their ships, (if any of you be afraid of this, I mean the idea of his not going to fight them with an equal number;)


7.67.3
5200
ἐν ὀλίγῳ γὰρ πολλαὶ ἀργότεραι μὲν ἐς τὸ δρᾶν τι ὧν βούλονται ἔσονται , ῥᾷσται δὲ ἐς τὸ βλάπτεσθαι ἀφ’ ὧν ἡμῖν παρεσκεύασται .
for many ships in a small space will be less effective for executing any of the movements they may wish, while they are most liable to he injured by our preparations. On the contrary, be assured of this, which is most true, according to the certain information which we believe we have received.


7.67.4
5201
τὸ δ’ ἀληθέστατον γνῶτε ἐξ ὧν ἡμεῖς οἰόμεθα σαφῶς πεπύσθαι ·
It is through the excess of their miseries, and from being forced to it by their present distress, that they are induced to make a desperate effort;


7.67.4
5202
ὑπερβαλλόντων γὰρ αὐτοῖς τῶν κακῶν καὶ βιαζόμενοι ὑπὸ τῆς παρούσης ἀπορίας ἐς ἀπόνοιαν καθεστήκασιν οὐ παρασκευῆς πίστει μᾶλλον ἢ τύχης ἀποκινδυνεῦσαι οὕτως ὅπως δύνανται , ἵν’ ἢ βιασάμενοι ἐκπλεύσωσιν ἢ κατὰ γῆν μετὰ τοῦτο τὴν ἀποχώρησιν ποιῶνται , ὡς τῶν γε παρόντων οὐκ ἂν πράξαντες χεῖρον .
not so much from confidence in their resources, as from hazarding a chance, in whatever way they can, that they may either force their passage and sail out, or afterwards retreat by land; since, at any rate, they could not fare worse than at present.


7.68.1
5203
πρὸς οὖν ἀταξίαν τε τοιαύτην καὶ τύχην ἀνδρῶν ἑαυτὴν παραδεδωκυῖαν πολεμιωτάτων ὀργῇ προσμείξωμεν , καὶ νομίσωμεν ἅμα μὲν νομιμώτατον εἶναι πρὸς τοὺς ἐναντίους οἳ ἂν ὡς ἐπὶ τιμωρίᾳ τοῦ προσπεσόντος δικαιώσωσιν ἀποπλῆσαι τῆς γνώμης τὸ θυμούμενον , ἅμα δὲ ἐχθροὺς ἀμύνασθαι ἐκγενησόμενον ἡμῖν καὶ τὸ λεγόμενόν που ἥδιστον εἶναι .
" To avail yourselves then of such confusion, and of the very fortune of our bitterest enemies, which has betrayed itself, let us close with them in wrath, and consider that the feeling of those men is most lawful, with regard to their enemies, who determine, when taking vengeance on their aggressor, to glut the animosity of their heart: and that we too shall have an opportunity of avenging ourselves on our foes—the very thing which is every where said to be most sweet."


7.68.2
5204
ὡς δὲ ἐχθροὶ καὶ ἔχθιστοι , πάντες ἴστε , οἵ γε ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμετέραν ἦλθον δουλωσόμενοι , ἐν ᾧ , εἰ κατώρθωσαν , ἀνδράσι μὲν ἂν τ- ἄλγιστα προσέθεσαν , παισὶ δὲ καὶ γυναιξὶ τὰ ἀπρεπέστατα , πόλει δὲ τῇ πάσῃ τὴν αἰσχίστην ἐπίκλησιν .
" For that they are our foes, and our bitterest foes, you all know; inasmuch as they came against our country to enslave it, and if they had succeeded, would have imposed on our men all that was most painful; on our children and wives, all that is most dishonourable; and on our whole country, the title which is most degrading."


7.68.3
5205
ἀνθ’ ὧν μὴ μαλακισθῆναί τινα πρέπει μηδὲ τὸ ἀκινδύνως ἀπελθεῖν αὐτοὺς κέρδος νομίσαι .
Wherefore no one ought to relent, or deem it gain that they should merely go away without danger to us.


7.68.3
5206
τοῦτο μὲν γὰρ καὶ ἐὰν κρατήσωσιν ὁμοίως δράσουσιν ·
For that they will do just the same, even if they gain the victory.


7.68.3
5207
τὸ δὲ πραξάντων ἐκ τοῦ εἰκότος ἃ βουλόμεθα τούσδε τε κολασθῆναι καὶ τῇ πάσῃ Σικελίᾳ καρπουμένῃ καὶ πρὶν ἐλευθερίαν βεβαιοτέραν παραδοῦναι , καλὸς ὁ ἀγών .
But that, through our succeeding (as we probably shall do) in our wishes, these men should be punished, and should leave a more secure liberty for the whole of Sicily, which even before enjoyed that blessing; this is a glorious object to contend for.


7.68.3
5208
καὶ κινδύνων οὗτοι σπανιώτατοι οἳ ἂν ἐλάχιστα ἐκ τοῦ σφαλῆναι βλάπτοντες πλεῖστα διὰ τὸ εὐτυχῆσαι ὠφελῶσιν &quot; .
And of all hazards those are most rare, which, while they cause least harm by failure, confer most advantage by success."


7.69.1
5209
καὶ οἱ μὲν τῶν Συρακοσίων στρατηγοὶ καὶ Γύλιππος τοιαῦτα καὶ αὐτοὶ τοῖς σφετέροις στρατιώταις παρακελευσάμενοι ἀντεπλήρουν τὰς ναῦς εὐθὺς ἐπειδὴ καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ᾐσθάνοντο .
The Syracusan commanders and Gylippus having in their turn thus exhorted their men, immediately manned the ships on their side also, since they saw that the Athenians were doing it.


7.69.2
5210
ὁ δὲ Νικίας ὑπὸ τῶν παρόντων ἐκπεπληγμένος καὶ ὁρῶν οἷος ὁ κίνδυνος καὶ ὡς ἐγγὺς ἤδη ἦν , ἐπειδὴ καὶ ὅσον οὐκ ἔμελλον ἀνάγεσθαι , καὶ νομίσας , ὅπερ πάσχουσιν ἐν τοῖς μεγάλοις ἀγῶσι , πάντα τε ἔργῳ ἔτι σφίσιν ἐνδεᾶ εἶναι καὶ λόγῳ αὐτοῖς οὔπω ἱκανὰ εἰρῆσθαι , αὖθις τῶν τριηράρχων ἕνα ἕκαστον ἀνεκάλει , πατρόθεν τε ἐπονομάζων καὶ αὐτοὺς ὀνομαστὶ καὶ φυλήν , ἀξιῶν τό τε καθ’ ἑαυτόν , ᾧ ὑπῆρχε λαμπρότητός τι , μὴ προδιδόναι τινὰ καὶ τὰς πατρικὰς ἀρετάς , ὧν ἐπιφανεῖς ἦσαν οἱ πρόγονοι , μὴ ἀφανίζειν , πατρίδος τε τῆς ἐλευθερωτάτης ὑπομιμνῄσκων καὶ τῆς ἐν αὐτῇ ἀνεπιτάκτου πᾶσιν ἐς τὴν δίαιταν ἐξουσίας , ἄλλα τε λέγων ὅσα ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ ἤδη τοῦ καιροῦ ὄντες ἄνθρωποι οὐ πρὸς τὸ δοκεῖν τινὶ ἀρχαιολογεῖν φυλαξάμενοι εἴποιεν ἄν , καὶ ὑπὲρ ἁπάντων παραπλήσια ἔς τε γυναῖκας καὶ παῖδας καὶ θεοὺς πατρῴους προφερόμενα , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τῇ παρούσῃ ἐκπλήξει ὠφέλιμα νομίζοντες ἐπιβοῶνται .
Nicias, on the other hand, being dismayed at the present circumstances of himself and his colleagues, and seeing how great and how close at hand now their peril was, since they were all but on the point of putting out; considering, too, (as men usually feel in great emergencies,) that in deed every thing fell short of what they would have it, while in word enough had not yet been said by them; again called to him each one of the Trierarchs, addressing them severally by their father's name, their own, and that of their tribe; begging each one who enjoyed any previous distinction, from personal considerations not to sacrifice it, nor to obscure those hereditary virtues for which his forefathers were illustrious; reminding them too of their country—the most free one in the world—and the power, subject to no man's dictation, which all enjoyed in it with regard to their mode of life; mentioning other things also, such as men would say at a time now so critical, not guarding against being thought by any one to bring forward old and hackneyed topics, and such as are advanced in all cases alike, about men's wives and children and country's gods, but loudly appealing to them, because they think they may be of service in the present consternation.


7.69.3
5211
καὶ ὁ μὲν οὐχ ἱκανὰ μᾶλλον ἢ καὶ ἀναγκαῖα νομίσας παρῃνῆσθαι , ἀποχωρήσας ἦγε τὸν πεζὸν πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ παρέταξεν ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐδύνατο , ὅπως ὅτι μεγίστη τοῖς ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶν ὠφελία ἐς τὸ θαρσεῖν γίγνοιτο ·
Thus he, thinking that he had addressed to them an exhortation which was not so much a satisfactory one, as one that he was compelled to be content with, went away from them, and led the troops down to the beach, and ranged them over as large a space as he could, that the greatest possible assistance might be given to those on board towards keeping up their spirits.


7.69.4
5212
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης καὶ Μένανδρος καὶ Εὐθύδημος ( οὗτοι γὰρ ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγοὶ ἐπέβησαν ) ἄραντες ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑαυτῶν στρατοπέδου εὐθὺς ἔπλεον πρὸς τὸ ζεῦγμα τοῦ λιμένος καὶ τὸν παραλειφθέντα διέκπλουν , βουλόμενοι βιάσασθαι ἐς τὸ ἔξω .
Demosthenes, Menander, and Euthydemus, who went on board the Athenian fleet to take the command, put out from their own station, and immediately sailed to the bar at the mouth of the harbour, and the passage through it which had been closed up, wishing to force their way to the outside.


7.70.1
5213
προεξαγαγόμενοι δὲ οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ναυσὶ παραπλησίαις τὸν ἀριθμὸν καὶ πρότερον , κατά τε τὸν ἔκπλουν μέρει αὐτῶν ἐφύλασσον καὶ κατὰ τὸν ἄλλον κύκλῳ λιμένα , ὅπως πανταχόθεν ἅμα προσπίπτοιεν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , καὶ ὁ πεζὸς ἅμα αὐτοῖς παρεβοήθει ᾗπερ καὶ αἱ νῆες κατίσχοιεν .
The Syracusans and their allies, having previously put out with pretty nearly the same number of ships as before, proceeded to keep guard with part of them at the passage out, and also round the circumference of the whole harbour, that they might fall upon the Athenians on all sides at once, while their troops also at the same time came to their aid at whatever part their vessels might put in to shore.


7.70.1
5214
ἦρχον δὲ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ τοῖς Συρακοσίοις Σικανὸς μὲν καὶ Ἀγάθαρχος , κέρας ἑκάτερος τοῦ παντὸς ἔχων , Πυθὴν δὲ καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι τὸ μέσον .
The commanders of the Syracusan fleet were Sicanus and Agatharchus, each occupying a wing of the whole force, with Pythen and the Corinthians in the centre.


7.70.2
5215
ἐπειδὴ δὲ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἀθηναῖοι προσέμισγον τῷ ζεύγματι , τῇ μὲν πρώτῃ ῥύμῃ ἐπιπλέοντες ἐκράτουν τῶν τεταγμένων νεῶν πρὸς αὐτῷ καὶ ἐπειρῶντο λύειν τὰς κλῄσεις ·
When the Athenians came up to the bar, in the first rush with which they charged they got the better of the ships posted at it, and endeavoured to break the fastenings.


7.70.2
5216
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο πανταχόθεν σφίσι τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ξυμμάχων ἐπιφερομένων οὐ πρὸς τῷ ζεύγματι ἔτι μόνον ἡ ναυμαχία , ἀλλὰ καὶ κατὰ τὸν λιμένα ἐγίγνετο , καὶ ἦν καρτερὰ καὶ οἵα οὐχ ἑτέρα τῶν προτέρων .
Afterwards, when the Syracusans and their allies bore down upon them from all quarters, the engagement was going on no longer at the bar alone, but over the harbour also; and an obstinate one it was, such as none of the previous ones had been. For great eagerness for the attack was exhibited by the seamen on both sides, when the command was given;


7.70.3
5217
πολλὴ μὲν γὰρ ἑκατέροις προθυμία ἀπὸ τῶν ναυτῶν ἐς τὸ ἐπιπλεῖν ὁπότε κελευσθείη ἐγίγνετο , πολλὴ δὲ ἡ ἀντιτέχνησις τῶν κυβερνητῶν καὶ ἀγωνισμὸς πρὸς ἀλλήλους ·
and there was much counter-manoeuvring on the part of the masters, and rivalry with each other;


7.70.3
5218
οἵ τε ἐπιβάται ἐθεράπευον , ὁπότε προσπέσοι ναῦς νηί , μὴ λείπεσθαι τὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ καταστρώματος τῆς ἄλλης τέχνης ·
while the soldiers on board exerted themselves, when vessel came in collision with vessel, that the operations on deck might not fall short of the skill shown by others.


7.70.3
5219
πᾶς τέ τις ἐν ᾧ προσετέτακτο αὐτὸς ἕκαστος ἠπείγετο πρῶτος φαίνεσθαι .
Indeed every one, whatever the duty assigned him, made every effort that he might himself in each case appear the best man.


7.70.4
5220
ξυμπεσουσῶν δὲ ἐν ὀλίγῳ πολλῶν νεῶν ( πλεῖσται γὰρ δὴ αὗται ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ ἐναυμάχησαν ·
And as a great number of ships were engaged in a small compass, (for indeed they were the largest fleets fighting in the narrowest space that had ever been known, since both of them together fell little short of two hundred,)


7.70.4
5221
βραχὺ γὰρ ἀπέλιπον ξυναμφότεραι διακόσιαι γενέσθαι ) αἱ μὲν ἐμβολαὶ διὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι τὰς ἀνακρούσεις καὶ διέκπλους ὀλίγαι ἐγίγνοντο , αἱ δὲ προσβολαί , ὡς τύχοι ναῦς νηὶ προσπεσοῦσα ἢ διὰ τὸ φεύγειν ἢ ἄλλῃ ἐπιπλέουσα , πυκνότεραι ἦσαν .
the attacks made with the beaks were few, as there were no means of backing water, or cutting through the enemy's line; but chance collisions were more frequent, just as one ship might happen to run into another, either in flying from or attacking a second.


7.70.5
5222
καὶ ὅσον μὲν χρόνον προσφέροιτο ναῦς , οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν καταστρωμάτων τοῖς ἀκοντίοις καὶ τοξεύμασι καὶ λίθοις ἀφθόνως ἐπ’ αὐτὴν ἐχρῶντο ·
So long as a vessel was coming up to the charge, those on her decks plied their javelins, arrows, and stones in abundance against her;


7.70.5
5223
ἐπειδὴ δὲ προσμείξειαν , οἱ ἐπιβάται ἐς χεῖρας ἰόντες ἐπειρῶντο ταῖς ἀλλήλων ναυσὶν ἐπιβαίνειν .
but when they came to close quarters, the heavy-armed marines, fighting hand to hand, endeavoured to board each others ships.


7.70.6
5224
ξυνετύγχανέ τε πολλαχοῦ διὰ τὴν στενοχωρίαν τὰ μὲν ἄλλοις ἐμβεβληκέναι , τὰ δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐμβεβλῆσθαι , δύο τε περὶ μίαν καὶ ἔστιν ᾗ καὶ πλείους ναῦς κατ’ ἀνάγκην ξυνηρτῆσθαι , καὶ τοῖς κυβερνήταις τῶν μὲν φυλακήν , τῶν δ’ ἐπιβουλήν , μὴ καθ’ ἓν ἕκαστον , κατὰ πολλὰ δὲ πανταχόθεν , περιεστάναι , καὶ τὸν κτύπον μέγαν ἀπὸ πολλῶν νεῶν ξυμπιπτουσῶν ἔκπληξίν τε ἅμα καὶ ἀποστέρησιν τῆς ἀκοῆς ὧν οἱ κελευσταὶ φθέγγοιντο παρέχειν .
In many cases too it happened, through want of room, that on one side they were charging an enemy, and on the other were being charged themselves, and that two ships, and sometimes even more, were by compulsion eutangled round one. And thus the masters had to guard against some, and to concert measures against others—not one thing at a time, but many things on every side—while the great din from such a number of ships coming into collision both spread dismay and prevented their hearing what the boatswains said.


7.70.7
5225
πολλὴ γὰρ δὴ ἡ παρακέλευσις καὶ βοὴ ἀφ’ ἑκατέρων τοῖς κελευσταῖς κατά τε τὴν τέχνην καὶ πρὸς τὴν αὐτίκα φιλονικίαν ἐγίγνετο , τοῖς μὲν Ἀθηναίοις βιάζεσθαί τε τὸν ἔκπλουν ἐπιβοῶντες καὶ περὶ τῆς ἐς τὴν πατρίδα σωτηρίας νῦν , εἴ ποτε καὶ αὖθις , προθύμως ἀντιλαβέσθαι , τοῖς δὲ Συρακοσίοις καὶ ξυμμάχοις καλὸν εἶναι κωλῦσαί τε αὐτοὺς διαφυγεῖν καὶ τὴν οἰκείαν ἑκάστους πατρίδα νικήσαντας ἐπαυξῆσαι .
For many were the orders given and the shouts raised by those officers on each side, both in the discharge of their duty, and from their present eagerness for the battle: while they cried out to the Athenians, " to force the passage, and now, if ever they meant to do it hereafter, to exert themselves heartily for a safe return to their country;"  and to the Syracusans and their allies, " that it would be a glorious achievement for them to prevent the enemy's escape, and by gaining the victory to confer honour on their respective countries."


7.70.8
5226
καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ προσέτι ἑκατέρων , εἴ τινά που ὁρῷεν μὴ κατ’ ἀνάγκην πρύμναν κρουόμενον , ἀνακαλοῦντες ὀνομαστὶ τὸν τριήραρχον ἠρώτων , οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι εἰ τὴν πολεμιωτάτην γῆν οἰκειοτέραν ἤδη τῆς οὐ δι’ ὀλίγου πόνου κεκτημένης θαλάσσης ἡγούμενοι ὑποχωροῦσιν , οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι εἰ οὓς σαφῶς ἴσασι προθυμουμένους Ἀθηναίους παντὶ τρόπῳ διαφυγεῖν , τούτους αὐτοὶ φεύγοντας φεύγουσιν .
The commanders, moreover, on each side, if they saw any captain in any part unnecessarily rowing astern, called out on him by name and asked him, on the side of the Athenians, " whether they were retreating because they considered the land, which was in the possession of their bitterest enemies, as more their own than the sea, which had been won with no small trouble?"  on that of the Syracusans, " whether they were themselves flying from the flying Athenians, whom they knew for certain to be anxious to escape from them in any way whatever?"


7.71.1
5227
ὅ τε ἐκ τῆς γῆς πεζὸς ἀμφοτέρων ἰσορρόπου τῆς ναυμαχίας καθεστηκυίας πολὺν τὸν ἀγῶνα καὶ ξύστασιν τῆς γνώμης εἶχε , φιλονικῶν μὲν ὁ αὐτόθεν περὶ τοῦ πλέονος ἤδη καλοῦ , δεδιότες δὲ οἱ ἐπελθόντες μὴ τῶν παρόντων ἔτι χείρω πράξωσιν .
The troops on shore too, on both sides, when the sea-fight was so equally balanced, suffered a great agony and conflict of feelings; those of the country being ambitious now of still greater honour, while their invaders were afraid of faring even worse than at present.


7.71.2
5228
πάντων γὰρ δὴ ἀνακειμένων τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐς τὰς ναῦς ὅ τε φόβος ἦν ὑπὲρ τοῦ μέλλοντος οὐδενὶ ἐοικώς , καὶ διὰ τὸ ἀνώμαλον τῆς ναυμαχίας ἀνώμαλον καὶ τὴν ἔποψιν ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἠναγκάζοντο ἔχειν .
For, since the Athenians' all was staked on their fleet, their fear for the future was like none they had ever felt before; and from the unequal nature of the engagement they were also compelled to have an unequal view of it from the beach.


7.71.3
5229
δι’ ὀλίγου γὰρ οὔσης τῆς θέας καὶ οὐ πάντων ἅμα ἐς τὸ αὐτὸ σκοπούντων , εἰ μέν τινες ἴδοιέν πῃ τοὺς σφετέρους ἐπικρατοῦντας , ἀνεθάρσησάν τε ἂν καὶ πρὸς ἀνάκλησιν θεῶν μὴ στερῆσαι σφᾶς τῆς σωτηρίας ἐτρέποντο , οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ τὸ ἡσσώμενον βλέψαντες ὀλοφυρμῷ τε ἅμα μετὰ βοῆς ἐχρῶντο καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν δρωμένων τῆς ὄψεως καὶ τὴν γνώμην μᾶλλον τῶν ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ ἐδουλοῦντο ·
For as the spectacle was near at hand, and as they did not all look at the same part at once, if any saw their own men victorious in any quarter, they would be encouraged, and turn to calling on the gods not to deprive them of safety;


7.71.3
5230
ἄλλοι δὲ καὶ πρὸς ἀντίπαλόν τι τῆς ναυμαχίας ἀπιδόντες , διὰ τὸ ἀκρίτως ξυνεχὲς τῆς ἁμίλλης καὶ τοῖς σώμασιν αὐτοῖς ἴσα τῇ δόξῃ περιδεῶς ξυναπονεύοντες ἐν τοῖς χαλεπώτατα διῆγον ·
while those who looked on the part that was being beaten, uttered lamentations at the same time as cries, and from the sight they had of what was going on, expressed their feelings more than those engaged in the action.


7.71.3
5231
αἰεὶ γὰρ παρ’ ὀλίγον ἢ διέφευγον ἢ ἀπώλλυντο .
Others, again, looking on a doubtful point of the engagement, in consequence of the indecisive continuance of the conflict, in their excessive fear made gestures with their very bodies, corresponding with their thoughts, and continued in the most distressing state, for they were constantly within a little of escaping, or of being destroyed.


7.71.4
5232
ἦν τε ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ στρατεύματι τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ἕως ἀγχώμαλα ἐναυμάχουν , πάντα ὁμοῦ ἀκοῦσαι , ὀλοφυρμὸς βοή , νικῶντες κρατούμενοι , ἄλλα ὅσα ἐν μεγάλῳ κινδύνῳ μέγα στρατόπεδον πολυειδῆ ἀναγκάζοιτο φθέγγεσθαι .
And thus amongst the troops of the Athenians, as long as they ware fighting at sea on equal terms, every sound might be heard at once, wailing, shouting, " they conquer,"  " they are conquered,"  and all the other various exclamations which a great armament in great peril would be constrained to utter—


7.71.5
5233
παραπλήσια δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ τῶν νεῶν αὐτοῖς ἔπασχον , πρίν γε δὴ οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐπὶ πολὺ ἀντισχούσης τῆς ναυμαχίας ἔτρεψάν τε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ ἐπικείμενοι λαμπρῶς , πολλῇ κραυγῇ καὶ διακελευσμῷ χρώμενοι , κατεδίωκον ἐς τὴν γῆν .
very much in the same way as their men on board their ships were affected—until at length, after the battle had continued for a long time, the Syracusans and their allies routed the Athenians, and pressing on them in a decisive manner, with much shouting and cheering of each other on, pursued them to the shore.


7.71.6
5234
τότε δὲ ὁ μὲν ναυτικὸς στρατὸς ἄλλος ἄλλῃ , ὅσοι μὴ μετέωροι ἑάλωσαν , κατενεχθέντες ἐξέπεσον ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον ·
Then the sea forces, as many as were not taken afloat, put in to the land at different parts, and rushed from on board to the camp;


7.71.6
5235
ὁ δὲ πεζὸς οὐκέτι διαφόρως , ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ μιᾶς ὁρμῆς οἰμωγῇ τε καὶ στόνῳ πάντες δυσανασχετοῦντες τὰ γιγνόμενα , οἱ μὲν ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς παρεβοήθουν , οἱ δὲ πρὸς τὸ λοιπὸν τοῦ τείχους ἐς φυλακήν , ἄλλοι δὲ καὶ οἱ πλεῖστοι ἤδη περὶ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ ὅπῃ σωθήσονται διεσκόπουν .
while the army, no longer with any different feelings, but all on one impulse, lamenting and groaning, deplored the event, and proceeded, some to succour the ships, others to guard what remained of their wall; while others, and those the greatest part, began now to think of themselves, and how they should best provide for their own preservation.


7.71.7
5236
ἦν τε ἐν τῷ παραυτίκα οὐδεμιᾶς δὴ τῶν ξυμπασῶν ἐλάσσων ἔκπληξις .
Indeed their dismay at the moment had been exceeded by none of all they had ever felt.


7.71.7
5237
παραπλήσιά τε ἐπεπόνθεσαν καὶ ἔδρασαν αὐτοὶ ἐν Πύλῳ ·
And they now experienced pretty nearly what they had themselves inflicted at Pylus:


7.71.7
5238
διαφθαρεισῶν γὰρ τῶν νεῶν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις προσαπώλλυντο αὐτοῖς καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ἄνδρες διαβεβηκότες , καὶ τότε τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἀνέλπιστον ἦν τὸ κατὰ γῆν σωθήσεσθαι , ἢν μή τι παρὰ λόγον γίγνηται .
for by the Lacedaemonians' losing their ships, their men who had crossed over into the island were lost to them besides: and at this time for the Athenians to escape by land was hopeless, unless something beyond all expectation should occur.


7.72.1
5239
γενομένης δ’ ἰσχυρᾶς τῆς ναυμαχίας καὶ πολλῶν νεῶν ἀμφοτέροις καὶ ἀνθρώπων ἀπολομένων οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐπικρατήσαντες τά τε ναυάγια καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ἀνείλοντο , καὶ ἀποπλεύσαντες πρὸς τὴν πόλιν τροπαῖον ἔστησαν , οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ὑπὸ μεγέθους τῶν παρόντων κακῶν νεκρῶν μὲν πέρι ἢ ναυαγίων οὐδὲ ἐπενόουν αἰτῆσαι ἀναίρεσιν , τῆς δὲ νυκτὸς ἐβουλεύοντο εὐθὺς ἀναχωρεῖν .
After the battle had been thus obstinately disputed, and many ships and men destroyed on both sides, the Syracusans and allies, having gained the victory, took up their wrecks and dead, and then sailed away to the city, and erected a trophy.


7.72.3
5240
Δημοσθένης δὲ Νικίᾳ προσελθὼν γνώμην ἐποιεῖτο πληρώσαντας ἔτι τὰς λοιπὰς τῶν νεῶν βιάσασθαι , ἢν δύνωνται , ἅμα ἕῳ τὸν ἔκπλουν , λέγων ὅτι πλείους ἔτι αἱ λοιπαί εἰσι νῆες χρήσιμαι σφίσιν ἢ τοῖς πολεμίοις ·
Demosthenes, however, went to Nicias, and expressed it as his opinion, that they should still man their remaining ships, and force their passage; out, if they could, in the morning; alleging that they still had left more ships fit for service than the enemy;


7.72.3
5241
ἦσαν γὰρ τοῖς μὲν Ἀθηναίοις περίλοιποι ὡς ἑξήκοντα , τοῖς δ’ ἐναντίοις ἐλάσσους ἢ πεντήκοντα .
for the Athenians had about sixty remaining, while their adversaries had less than fifty.


7.72.4
5242
καὶ ξυγχωροῦντος Νικίου τῇ γνώμῃ καὶ βουλομένων πληροῦν αὐτῶν οἱ ναῦται οὐκ ἤθελον ἐσβαίνειν διὰ τὸ καταπεπλῆχθαί τε τῇ ἥσσῃ καὶ μὴ ἂν ἔτι οἴεσθαι κρατῆσαι .
But when Nicias agreed with this opinion, and they wished to man them, the seamen would not embark, through being dismayed at their defeat, and thinking that they could not now gain a victory. And so they all now made up their minds to retreat by land.


7.73.1
5243
καὶ οἱ μὲν ὡς κατὰ γῆν ἀναχωρήσοντες ἤδη ξύμπαντες τὴν γνώμην εἶχον , Ἑρμοκράτης δὲ ὁ Συρακόσιος ὑπονοήσας αὐτῶν τὴν διάνοιαν καὶ νομίσας δεινὸν εἶναι εἰ τοσαύτη στρατιὰ κατὰ γῆν ὑποχωρήσασα καὶ καθεζομένη ποι τῆς Σικελίας βουλήσεται αὖθις σφίσι τὸν πόλεμον ποιεῖσθαι , ἐσηγεῖται ἐλθὼν τοῖς ἐν τέλει οὖσιν ὡς οὐ χρεὼν ἀποχωρῆσαι τῆς νυκτὸς αὐτοὺς περιιδεῖν , λέγων ταῦτα ἃ καὶ αὐτῷ ἐδόκει , ἀλλὰ ἐξελθόντας ἤδη πάντας Συρακοσίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους τάς τε ὁδοὺς ἀποικοδομῆσαι καὶ τὰ στενόπορα τῶν χωρίων προδιαλαβόντας φυλάσσειν .
But Hermocrates the Syracusan, suspecting their purpose, and thinking that it would be a dreadful thing, if so large a force, after retreating by land and settling any where in Sicily, should choose again to carry on the war with them, went to the authorities, and explained to them that they ought not to suffer them to retreat during the night, (stating what he himself thought,) but that all the Syracusans and allies should at once go out, and block up the roads, and keep guard beforehand at the narrow passes.


7.73.2
5244
οἱ δὲ ξυνεγίγνωσκον μὲν καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐχ ἧσσον ταῦτα ἐκείνου , καὶ ἐδόκει ποιητέα εἶναι , τοὺς δὲ ἀνθρώπους ἄρτι ἀσμένους ἀπὸ ναυμαχίας τε μεγάλης ἀναπεπαυμένους καὶ ἅμα ἑορτῆς οὔσης ( ἔτυχε γὰρ αὐτοῖς Ἡρακλεῖ ταύτην τὴν ἡμέραν θυσία οὖσα ) οὐ δοκεῖν ἂν ῥᾳδίως ἐθελῆσαι ὑπακοῦσαι ·
But though the magistrates also agreed with him in thinking this, no less than himself, and were of opinion that it ought to be done,


7.73.2
5245
ὑπὸ γὰρ τοῦ περιχαροῦς τῆς νίκης πρὸς πόσιν τετράφθαι τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ , καὶ πάντα μᾶλλον ἐλπίζειν ἂν σφῶν πείθεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἢ ὅπλα λαβόντας ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἐξελθεῖν .
yet they thought that the people, in their recent joy and relaxation after the labours of a great sea-fight, especially, too, as it was a time of feasting, (for they happened to celebrate on this day a sacrifice to Hercules,) would not easily be induced to listen to them; as the majority, from excessive gladness at their victory, had fallen to drinking during the festival, and would, they expected, rather obey them in any thing than in taking arms, just at present, and marching out.


7.73.3
5246
ὡς δὲ τοῖς ἄρχουσι ταῦτα λογιζομένοις ἐφαίνετο ἄπορα καὶ οὐκέτι ἔπειθεν αὐτοὺς ὁ Ἑρμοκράτης , αὐτὸς ἐπὶ τούτοις τάδε μηχανᾶται , δεδιὼς μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καθ’ ἡσυχίαν προφθάσωσιν ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ διελθόντες τὰ χαλεπώτατα τῶν χωρίων .
When, on consideration of this, it appeared a difficulty to the magistrates, and Hermocrates could not then prevail upon them to attempt it, he afterwards devised the following scheme.


7.73.3
5247
πέμπει τῶν ἑταίρων τινὰς τῶν ἑαυτοῦ μετὰ ἱππέων πρὸς τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατόπεδον , ἡνίκα ξυνεσκόταζεν ·
Being afraid that the Athenians might get the start of them by quietly passing during the night the most difficult points of the country, he sent certain of his own friends with some cavalry to the Athenian camp, as soon as it grew dark.


7.73.3
5248
οἳ προσελάσαντες ἐξ ὅσου τις ἔμελλεν ἀκούσεσθαι καὶ ἀνακαλεσάμενοί τινας ὡς ὄντες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπιτήδειοι ( ἦσαν γάρ τινες τῷ Νικίᾳ διάγγελοι τῶν ἔνδοθεν ) ἐκέλευον φράζειν Νικίᾳ μὴ ἀπάγειν τῆς νυκτὸς τὸ στράτευμα ὡς Συρακοσίων τὰς ὁδοὺς φυλασσόντων , ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν τῆς ἡμέρας παρασκευασάμενον ἀποχωρεῖν .
These, riding up to within hearing, and calling to them certain individuals, as though they were friends of the Athenians, (for there were some who sent tidings to Nicias of what passed within the city,) desired them to tell that general not to lead off his army by night, as the Syracusans were guarding the roads; but to retire leisurely by day after making his preparations.


7.73.4
5249
καὶ οἱ μὲν εἰπόντες ἀπῆλθον , καὶ οἱ ἀκούσαντες διήγγειλαν τοῖς στρατηγοῖς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ·
They then, after delivering this message, returned; while those who heard it, reported the same to the Athenian generals.


7.74.1
5250
οἱ δὲ πρὸς τὸ ἄγγελμα ἐπέσχον τὴν νύκτα , νομίσαντες οὐκ ἀπάτην εἶναι .
They, in accordance with the information, stopped for the night, considering it to be no false statement.


7.74.1
5251
καὶ ἐπειδὴ καὶ ὣς οὐκ εὐθὺς ὥρμησαν , ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς καὶ τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν ἡμέραν περιμεῖναι , ὅπως ξυσκευάσαιντο ὡς ἐκ τῶν δυνατῶν οἱ στρατιῶται ὅτι χρησιμώτατα , καὶ τὰ μὲν ἄλλα πάντα καταλιπεῖν , ἀναλαβόντες δὲ αὐτὰ ὅσα περὶ τὸ σῶμα ἐς δίαιταν ὑπῆρχεν ἐπιτήδεια ἀφορμᾶσθαι .
And since they had not, as it was, set out immediately, they determined to remain over the next day also, that the soldiers might pack up, as well as they could, the most useful articles; and though they left every thing else behind, to take with them, when they started, just what was necessary for their personal support.


7.74.2
5252
Συρακόσιοι δὲ καὶ Γύλιππος τῷ μὲν πεζῷ προεξελθόντες τάς τε ὁδοὺς τὰς κατὰ τὴν χώραν , ᾗ εἰκὸς ἦν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἰέναι , ἀπεφάργνυσαν καὶ τῶν ῥείθρων καὶ τῶν ποταμῶν τὰς διαβάσεις ἐφύλασσον καὶ ἐς ὑποδοχὴν τοῦ στρατεύματος ὡς κωλύσοντες ᾗ ἐδόκει ἐτάσσοντο ·
But the Syracusans and Gylippus had marched out before with their troops, and were blocking up the roads through the country where it was likely the Athenians would advance, as well as guarding the passages of the streams and rivers, and posting themselves for the reception of the army, in order to stop it where they thought best;


7.74.2
5253
ταῖς δὲ ναυσὶ προσπλεύσαντες τὰς ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰγιαλοῦ ἀφεῖλκον ( ἐνέπρησαν δέ τινας ὀλίγας , ὥσπερ διενοήθησαν , αὐτοὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ) , τὰς δ’ ἄλλας καθ’ ἡσυχίαν οὐδενὸς κωλύοντος ὡς ἑκάστην ποι ἐκπεπτωκυῖαν ἀναδησάμενοι ἐκόμιζον ἐς τὴν πόλιν .
while with their ships they sailed to those of the Athenians, and towed them off from the beach. Some few indeed the Athenians themselves had burnt, as they had intended; but the rest they lashed to their own at their leisure, as each had been thrown up on any part of the beach, and, without any one trying to stop them, conveyed them to the city.


7.75.1
5254
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο , ἐπειδὴ ἐδόκει τῷ Νικίᾳ καὶ τῷ Δημοσθένει ἱκανῶς παρεσκευάσθαι , καὶ ἡ ἀνάστασις ἤδη τοῦ στρατεύματος τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπὸ τῆς ναυμαχίας ἐγίγνετο .
After this, when Nicias and Demosthenes thought they were sufficiently prepared, the removal of the army took place, on the third day after the sea-fight.


7.75.2
5255
δεινὸν οὖν ἦν οὐ καθ’ ἓν μόνον τῶν πραγμάτων , ὅτι τάς τε ναῦς ἀπολωλεκότες πάσας ἀπεχώρουν καὶ ἀντὶ μεγάλης ἐλπίδος καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ ἡ πόλις κινδυνεύοντες , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀπολείψει τοῦ στρατοπέδου ξυνέβαινε τῇ τε ὄψει ἑκάστῳ ἀλγεινὰ καὶ τῇ γνώμῃ αἰσθέσθαι .
It was a wretched scene then, not on account of the single circumstance alone, that they were retreating after having lost all their ships, and while both themselves and their country were in danger, instead of being in high hope; but also because, on leaving their camp, every one had grievous things both to behold with his eyes and to feel in his heart.


7.75.3
5256
τῶν τε γὰρ νεκρῶν ἀτάφων ὄντων , ὁπότε τις ἴδοι τινὰ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων κείμενον , ἐς λύπην μετὰ φόβου καθίστατο , καὶ οἱ ζῶντες καταλειπόμενοι τραυματίαι τε καὶ ἀσθενεῖς πολὺ τῶν τεθνεώτων τοῖς ζῶσι λυπηρότεροι ἦσαν καὶ τῶν ἀπολωλότων ἀθλιώτεροι .
For as the dead lay unburied, and any one saw a friend on the ground, he was struck at once with grief and fear. And the living who were being left behind, wounded or sick, were to the living a much more sorrowful spectacle than the dead, and more piteous than those who had perished.


7.75.4
5257
πρὸς γὰρ ἀντιβολίαν καὶ ὀλοφυρμὸν τραπόμενοι ἐς ἀπορίαν καθίστασαν , ἄγειν τε σφᾶς ἀξιοῦντες καὶ ἕνα ἕκαστον ἐπιβοώμενοι , εἴ τινά πού τις ἴδοι ἢ ἑταίρων ἢ οἰκείων , τῶν τε ξυσκήνων ἤδη ἀπιόντων ἐκκρεμαννύμενοι καὶ ἐπακολουθοῦντες ἐς ὅσον δύναιντο , εἴ τῳ δὲ προλίποι ἡ ῥώμη καὶ τὸ σῶμα , οὐκ ἄνευ ὀλίγων ἐπιθειασμῶν καὶ οἰμωγῆς ὑπολειπόμενοι , ὥστε δάκρυσι πᾶν τὸ στράτευμα πλησθὲν καὶ ἀπορίᾳ τοιαύτῃ μὴ ῥᾳδίως ἀφορμᾶσθαι , καίπερ ἐκ πολεμίας τε καὶ μείζω ἢ κατὰ δάκρυα τὰ μὲν πεπονθότας ἤδη , τὰ δὲ περὶ τῶν ἐν ἀφανεῖ δεδιότας μὴ πάθωσιν .
For having recourse to entreaties and wailings, they reduced them to utter perplexity, begging to be taken away, and appealing to each individual friend or relative that any of them might any where see; ZZZ hanging on their comrades, as they were now going away; or following as far as they could, and when in any case the strength of their body failed, not being left behind without many appeals to heaven and many lamentations. So that the whole army, being filled with tears and distress of this kind, did not easily get away, although from an enemy's country, and although they had both suffered already miseries too great for tears to express, and were still afraid for the future, lest they might suffer more.


7.75.5
5258
κατήφειά τέ τις ἅμα καὶ κατάμεμψις σφῶν αὐτῶν πολλὴ ἦν .
There was also amongst them much dejection and depreciation of their own strength.


7.75.5
5259
οὐδὲν γὰρ ἄλλο ἢ πόλει ἐκπεπολιορκημένῃ ἐῴκεσαν ὑποφευγούσῃ , καὶ ταύτῃ οὐ σμικρᾷ ·
For they resembled nothing but a city starved out and attempting to escape; and no small one too,


7.75.5
5260
μυριάδες γὰρ τοῦ ξύμπαντος ὄχλου οὐκ ἐλάσσους τεσσάρων ἅμα ἐπορεύοντο .
for of their whole multitude there were not less than forty thousand on the march.


7.75.5
5261
καὶ τούτων οἵ τε ἄλλοι πάντες ἔφερον ὅτι τις ἐδύνατο ἕκαστος χρήσιμον , καὶ οἱ ὁπλῖται καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς παρὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς αὐτοὶ τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν σιτία ὑπὸ τοῖς ὅπλοις , οἱ μὲν ἀπορίᾳ ἀκολούθων , οἱ δὲ ἀπιστίᾳ ·
Of these, all the rest took whatever each one could that was useful, and the heavy-armed and cavalry themselves, contrary to custom, carried their own food under their arms, some for want of servants, others through distrusting them;


7.75.5
5262
ἀπηυτομολήκεσαν γὰρ πάλαι τε καὶ οἱ πλεῖστοι παραχρῆμα .
for they had for a long time been deserting, and did so in greatest numbers at that moment.


7.75.5
5263
ἔφερον δὲ οὐδὲ ταῦτα ἱκανά ·
And even what they carried was not sufficient;


7.75.5
5264
σῖτος γὰρ οὐκέτι ἦν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ .
for there was no longer any food in the camp.


7.75.6
5265
καὶ μὴν ἡ ἄλλη αἰκία καὶ ἡ ἰσομοιρία τῶν κακῶν , ἔχουσά τινα ὅμως τὸ μετὰ πολλῶν κούφισιν , οὐδ’ ὣς ῥᾳδία ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἐδοξάζετο , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἀπὸ οἵας λαμπρότητος καὶ αὐχήματος τοῦ πρώτου ἐς οἵαν τελευτὴν καὶ ταπεινότητα ἀφῖκτο .
Nor, again, was their other misery, and their equal participation in sufferings, (though it affords some alleviation to endure with others,) considered even on that account easy to bear at the present time; especially, when they reflected from what splendour and boasting at first they had been reduced to such an abject termination.


7.75.7
5266
μέγιστον γὰρ δὴ τὸ διάφορον τοῦτο τῷ Ἑλληνικῷ στρατεύματι ἐγένετο , οἷς ἀντὶ μὲν τοῦ ἄλλους δουλωσομένους ἥκειν αὐτοὺς τοῦτο μᾶλλον δεδιότας μὴ πάθωσι ξυνέβη ἀπιέναι , ἀντὶ δ’ εὐχῆς τε καὶ παιάνων , μεθ’ ὧν ἐξέπλεον , πάλιν τούτων τοῖς ἐναντίοις ἐπιφημίσμασιν ἀφορμᾶσθαι ,πεζούς τε ἀντὶ ναυβατῶν πορευομένους καὶ ὁπλιτικῷ προσέχοντας μᾶλλον ἢ ναυτικῷ .
For this was the greatest reverse that ever befell a Grecian army; since, in contrast to their having come to enslave others, they had to depart in fear of undergoing that themselves; and instead of prayers and hymns, with which they sailed from home, they had to start on their return with omens the very contrary of these; going by land, instead of by sea, and relying on a military rather than a naval force.


7.75.7
5267
ὅμως δὲ ὑπὸ μεγέθους τοῦ ἐπικρεμαμένου ἔτι κινδύνου πάντα ταῦτα αὐτοῖς οἰστὰ ἐφαίνετο .
But nevertheless, in consequence of the greatness of the danger still impending, all these things seemed endurable to them.


7.76.1
5268
ὁρῶν δὲ ὁ Νικίας τὸ στράτευμα ἀθυμοῦν καὶ ἐν μεγάλῃ μεταβολῇ ὄν , ἐπιπαριὼν ὡς ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ἐθάρσυνέ τε καὶ παρεμυθεῖτο , βοῇ τε χρώμενος ἔτι μᾶλλον ἑκάστοις καθ’ οὓς γίγνοιτο ὑπὸ προθυμίας καὶ βουλόμενος ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον γεγωνίσκων ὠφελεῖν τι .
Nicias, seeing the army dejected, and greatly changed, passed along the ranks, and encouraged and cheered them, as well as existing circumstances allowed; speaking still louder than before, as he severally came opposite to them, in the earnestness of his feeling, and from wishing to be of service to them by making himself audible to as many as possible.


7.77.1
5269
&quot; καὶ ἐκ τῶν παρόντων , ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ ξύμμαχοι , ἐλπίδα χρὴ ἔχειν ( ἤδη τινὲς καὶ ἐκ δεινοτέρων ἢ τοιῶνδε ἐσώθησαν ) , μηδὲ καταμέμφεσθαι ὑμᾶς ἄγαν αὐτοὺς μήτε ταῖς ξυμφοραῖς μήτε ταῖς παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν νῦν κακοπαθίαις .
" Still, even in our present circumstances, Athenians and allies, must we cherish hope; for some men have, ere now, been preserved even from more dreadful circumstances than these. Nor should you think too meanly of yourselves, or yield too much to your misfortunes and present sufferings, which are beyond your desert."


7.77.2
5270
κ- ἐγώ τοι οὐδενὸς ὑμῶν οὔτε ῥώμῃ προφέρων ( ἀλλ’ ὁρᾶτε δὴ ὡς διάκειμαι ὑπὸ τῆς νόσου ) οὔτ’ εὐτυχίᾳ δοκῶν που ὕστερός του εἶναι κατά τε τὸν ἴδιον βίον καὶ ἐς τὰ ἄλλα , νῦν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κινδύνῳ τοῖς φαυλοτάτοις αἰωροῦμαι ·
For my own part, though I am not superior to any of you in strength, (for you see what a state I am in through disease,) and though I consider myself to be second to none, whether in my private life or in other respects,


7.77.2
5271
καίτοι πολλὰ μὲν ἐς θεοὺς νόμιμα δεδιῄτημαι , πολλὰ δὲ ἐς ἀνθρώπους δίκαια καὶ ἀνεπίφθονα .
yet now I am exposed to every danger, like the very meanest. And yet I have lived with much devotion, as regards the gods, and much justice and freedom from reproach, as regards men. And therefore my hope is still strong for the future;


7.77.3
5272
ἀνθ’ ὧν ἡ μὲν ἐλπὶς ὅμως θρασεῖα τοῦ μέλλοντος , αἱ δὲ ξυμφοραὶ οὐ κατ’ ἀξίαν δὴ φοβοῦσιν .
and my calamities do not terrify me, so much as they might.


7.77.3
5273
τάχα δὲ ἂν καὶ λωφήσειαν ·
Nay, they may perhaps be alleviated;


7.77.3
5274
ἱκανὰ γὰρ τοῖς τε πολεμίοις ηὐτύχηται , καὶ εἴ τῳ θεῶν ἐπίφθονοι ἐστρατεύσαμεν , ἀποχρώντως ἤδη τετιμωρήμεθα .
for our enemies have enjoyed enough good fortune; and if we displeased any of the gods by making this expedition, we have already been sufficiently punished for it. Others also, we know, have ere now marched against their neighbours;


7.77.4
5275
ἦλθον γάρ που καὶ ἄλλοι τινὲς ἤδη ἐφ’ ἑτέρους , καὶ ἀνθρώπεια δράσαντες ἀνεκτὰ ἔπαθον .
and after acting as men do, have suffered what they could endure.


7.77.4
5276
καὶ ἡμᾶς εἰκὸς νῦν τά τε ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐλπίζειν ἠπιώτερα ἕξειν ( οἴκτου γὰρ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἀξιώτεροι ἤδη ἐσμὲν ἢ φθόνου ) , καὶ ὁρῶντες ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς οἷοι ὁπλῖται ἅμα καὶ ὅσοι ξυντεταγμένοι χωρεῖτε μὴ καταπέπληχθε ἄγαν , λογίζεσθε δὲ ὅτι αὐτοί τε πόλις εὐθύς ἐστε ὅποι ἂν καθέζησθε καὶ ἄλλη οὐδεμία ὑμᾶς τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ οὔτ’ ἂν ἐπιόντας δέξαιτο ῥᾳδίως οὔτ’ ἂν ἱδρυθέντας που ἐξαναστήσειεν .
And so in our case it is reasonable now to hope that we shall find the wrath of the gods mitigated; for we are now deserving of pity at their hands, rather than of envy. Looking, too, on your own ranks, what experienced and numerous men of arms there are with you, advancing in battle-array together, do not be too much dismayed, but consider that you are yourselves at once a city, wherever you may settle; and that there is no other in Sicily that would either easily resist your attack, or expel you when settled any where. With regard to the march, that it may be safe and orderly, look to that yourselves;


7.77.5
5277
τὴν δὲ πορείαν ὥστ’ ἀσφαλῆ καὶ εὔτακτον εἶναι αὐτοὶ φυλάξατε , μὴ ἄλλο τι ἡγησάμενος ἕκαστος ἢ ἐν ᾧ ἂν ἀναγκασθῇ χωρίῳ μάχεσθαι , τοῦτο καὶ πατρίδα καὶ τεῖχος κρατήσας ἕξειν .
" with no other consideration, each of you, than that whatever the spot on which he may be compelled to fight, on that he will have, if victorious, both a country and a fortress."


7.77.6
5278
σπουδὴ δὲ ὁμοίως καὶ νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν ἔσται τῆς ὁδοῦ ·
And we shall hurry on our way both by day and night alike, as we have but scanty provisions;


7.77.6
5279
τὰ γὰρ ἐπιτήδεια βραχέα ἔχομεν , καὶ ἢν ἀντιλαβώμεθά του φιλίου χωρίου τῶν Σικελῶν ( οὗτοι γὰρ ἡμῖν διὰ τὸ Συρακοσίων δέος ἔτι βέβαιοι εἰσίν ) , ἤδη νομίζετε ἐν τῷ ἐχυρῷ εἶναι .
and if we can only reach some friendly town of the Sicels, (for they, through their fear of the Syracusans, are still true to us,) then consider yourselves to be in security.


7.77.6
5280
προπέπεμπται δ’ ὡς αὐτούς , καὶ ἀπαντᾶν εἰρημένον καὶ σιτία ἄλλα κομίζειν .
And a message has been sent forward to them, and directions have been given them to meet us, and bring a fresh supply of provisions."


7.77.7
5281
&quot; τό τε ξύμπαν γνῶτε , ὦ ἄνδρες στρατιῶται , ἀναγκαῖόν τε ὂν ὑμῖν ἀνδράσιν ἀγαθοῖς γίγνεσθαι ὡς μὴ ὄντος χωρίου ἐγγὺς ὅποι ἂν μαλακισθέντες σωθείητε καί , ἢν νῦν διαφύγητε τοὺς πολεμίους , οἵ τε ἄλλοι τευξόμενοι ὧν ἐπιθυμεῖτέ που ἐπιδεῖν καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὴν μεγάλην δύναμιν τῆς πόλεως καίπερ πεπτωκυῖαν ἐπανορθώσοντες ·
In short, you must be convinced, soldiers, both that it is necessary for you to be brave men—since there is no place near which you can reach in safety, if you act like cowards—


7.77.7
5282
ἄνδρες γὰρ πόλις , καὶ οὐ τείχη οὐδὲ νῆες ἀνδρῶν κεναί &quot; .
and, at the same time, that if you escape from your enemies now, the rest of you will gain a sight of all you may any where wish to see; and the Athenians will raise up again, though fallen at present, the great power of their country. For it is men that make a city, and not walls, or ships, without any to man them.


7.78.1
5283
ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοιάδε παρακελευόμενος ἅμα ἐπῄει τὸ στράτευμα , καὶ εἴ πῃ ὁρῴη διεσπασμένον καὶ μὴ ἐν τάξει χωροῦν ξυνάγων καὶ καθιστάς , καὶ ὁ Δημοσθένης οὐδὲν ἧσσον τοῖς καθ’ ἑαυτὸν τοιαῦτά τε καὶ παραπλήσια λέγων .
Nicias, then, delivered this exhortation, and at the same time went up to the troops, and if he saw them any where straggling, and not marching in order, he collected and brought them to their post; while Demosthenes also did no less to those who were near him, addressing them in a similar manner.


7.78.2
5284
τὸ δὲ ἐχώρει ἐν πλαισίῳ τεταγμένον , πρῶτον μὲν ἡγούμενον τὸ Νικίου , ἐφεπόμενον δὲ τὸ Δημοσθένους ·
They marched in the form of a hollow square, the division under Nicias taking the lead, and that of Demosthenes following;


7.78.2
5285
τοὺς δὲ σκευοφόρους καὶ τὸν πλεῖστον ὄχλον ἐντὸς εἶχον οἱ ὁπλῖται .
while the baggage bearers and the main crowd of camp followers were enclosed within the heavy-armed.


7.78.3
5286
καὶ ἐπειδή τε ἐγένοντο ἐπὶ τῇ διαβάσει τοῦ Ἀνάπου ποταμοῦ , ηὗρον ἐπ’ αὐτῷ παρατεταγμένους τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ξυμμάχων , καὶ τρεψάμενοι αὐτοὺς καὶ κρατήσαντες τοῦ πόρου ἐχώρουν ἐς τὸ πρόσθεν ·
When they had come to the ford of the river Anapus, they found drawn up at it a body of the Syracusans and allies;


7.78.3
5287
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι παριππεύοντές τε προσέκειντο καὶ ἐσακοντίζοντες οἱ ψιλοί .
but having routed these, and secured the passage, they proceeded onwards; while the Syracusans pressed them with charges of horse, as their light-armed did with their missiles.


7.78.4
5288
καὶ ταύτῃ μὲν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ προελθόντες σταδίους ὡς τεσσαράκοντα ηὐλίσαντο πρὸς λόφῳ τινὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ·
On that day the Athenians advanced about forty stades, and then halted for the night on a hill.


7.78.4
5289
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ πρῲ ἐπορεύοντο καὶ προῆλθον ὡς εἴκοσι σταδίους , καὶ κατέβησαν ἐς χωρίον ἄπεδόν τι καὶ αὐτοῦ ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο , βουλόμενοι ἔκ τε τῶν οἰκιῶν λαβεῖν τι ἐδώδιμον ( ᾠκεῖτο γὰρ ὁ χῶρος ) καὶ ὕδωρ μετὰ σφῶν αὐτῶν φέρεσθαι αὐτόθεν ·
The next day, starting early, they marched about twenty stades, and descended to a level place where they encamped, intending to obtain provisions from the houses (for the place was inhabited) and to carry water with them from there;


7.78.4
5290
ἐν γὰρ τῷ πρόσθεν ἐπὶ πολλὰ στάδια , ᾗ ἔμελλον ἰέναι , οὐκ ἄφθονον ἦν .
for ahead, for many stades, where they were about to go, there was no abundance.


7.78.5
5291
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι ἐν τούτῳ προελθόντες τὴν δίοδον τὴν ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν ἀπετείχιζον ·
The Syracusans, in the meantime, had gone on before, and were blocking up the pass in advance of them.


7.78.5
5292
ἦν δὲ λόφος καρτερὸς καὶ ἑκατέρωθεν αὐτοῦ χαράδρα κρημνώδης , ἐκαλεῖτο δὲ Ἀκραῖον λέπας .
For there was there a steep hill, with a precipitous ravine on either side of it, called the Acraeum Lepas.


7.78.6
5293
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι προῇσαν , καὶ οἱ τῶν Συρακοσίων καὶ ξυμμάχων αὐτοὺς ἱππῆς καὶ ἀκοντισταὶ ὄντες πολλοὶ ἑκατέρωθεν ἐκώλυον καὶ ἐσηκόντιζόν τε καὶ παρίππευον .
The next day the Athenians advanced, and the horse and dart-men of the Syracusans and allies, each in great numbers, impeded their progress, hurling their missiles upon them, and annoying them with cavalry charges.


7.78.6
5294
καὶ χρόνον μὲν πολὺν ἐμάχοντο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἔπειτα ἀνεχώρησαν πάλιν ἐς τὸ αὐτὸ στρατόπεδον .
The Athenians fought for a long time, and then returned again to the same camp,


7.78.6
5295
καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια οὐκέτι ὁμοίως εἶχον ·
no longer having provisions as they had before;


7.78.6
5296
οὐ γὰρ ἔτι ἀποχωρεῖν οἷόν τ’ ἦν ὑπὸ τῶν ἱππέων .
for it was no more possible to leave their position, because of the cavalry.


7.79.1
5297
πρῲ δὲ ἄραντες ἐπορεύοντο αὖθις , καὶ ἐβιάσαντο πρὸς τὸν λόφον ἐλθεῖν τὸν ἀποτετειχισμένον , καὶ ηὗρον πρὸ ἑαυτῶν ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἀποτειχίσματος τὴν πεζὴν στρατιὰν παρατεταγμένην οὐκ ἐπ’ ὀλίγων ἀσπίδων ·
Having started early, they began their march again, and forced their way to the hill which had been fortified;


7.79.1
5298
στενὸν γὰρ ἦν τὸ χωρίον .
where they found before them the enemy's infantry drawn up for the defence of the wall many spears deep; for the pass was but narrow.


7.79.2
5299
καὶ προσβαλόντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐτειχομάχουν , καὶ βαλλόμενοι ὑπὸ πολλῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ λόφου ἐπάντους ὄντος ( διικνοῦντο γὰρ ῥᾷον οἱ ἄνωθεν ) καὶ οὐ δυνάμενοι βιάσασθαι ἀνεχώρουν πάλιν καὶ ἀνεπαύοντο .
The Athenians charged and assaulted the wall, but being annoyed with missiles by a large body from the hill, which was steep, (for those on the heights more easily reached their aim,) and not being able to force a passage, they retreated again, and rested.


7.79.3
5300
ἔτυχον δὲ καὶ βρονταί τινες ἅμα γενόμεναι καὶ ὕδωρ , οἷα τοῦ ἔτους πρὸς μετόπωρον ἤδη ὄντος φιλεῖ γίγνεσθαι ·
There happened also to be at the same time some claps of thunder and rain, as is generally the case when the year is now verging on autumn;


7.79.3
5301
ἀφ’ ὧν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι μᾶλλον ἔτι ἠθύμουν καὶ ἐνόμιζον ἐπὶ τῷ σφετέρῳ ὀλέθρῳ καὶ ταῦτα πάντα γίγνεσθαι .
in consequence of which the Athenians were still more dispirited, and thought that all these things also were conspiring together for their ruin.


7.79.4
5302
ἀναπαυομένων δ’ αὐτῶν ὁ Γύλιππος καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι πέμπουσι μέρος τι τῆς στρατιᾶς ἀποτειχιοῦντας αὖ ἐκ τοῦ ὄπισθεν αὐτοὺς ᾗ προεληλύθεσαν ·
While they were resting, Gylippus and the Syracusans sent a part of their troops to intercept them again with a wall on their rear, where they had already passed:


7.79.4
5303
ἀντιπέμψαντες δὲ κ- ἐκεῖνοι σφῶν αὐτῶν τινὰς διεκώλυσαν .
but they, on their side also, sent some of their men against them, and prevented their doing it.


7.79.5
5304
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ ἀναχωρήσαντες πρὸς τὸ πεδίον μᾶλλον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ηὐλίσαντο .
After this, the Athenians returned again with all their army into the more level country, and there halted for the night.


7.79.5
5305
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ προυχώρουν , καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι προσέβαλλόν τε πανταχῇ αὐτοῖς κύκλῳ καὶ πολλοὺς κατετραυμάτιζον , καὶ εἰ μὲν ἐπίοιεν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὑπεχώρουν , εἰ δ’ ἀναχωροῖεν , ἐπέκειντο , καὶ μάλιστα τοῖς ὑστάτοις προσπίπτοντες , εἴ πως κατὰ βραχὺ τρεψάμενοι πᾶν τὸ στράτευμα φοβήσειαν .
The next day they marched forward, while the Syracusans discharged their weapons on them, surrounding them on all sides, and disabled many with wounds; retreating if the Athenians advanced against them, and pressing on them if they gave way; most especially attacking their extreme rear, in the hope that by routing them little by little, they might strike terror into the whole army.


7.79.6
5306
καὶ ἐπὶ πολὺ μὲν τοιούτῳ τρόπῳ ἀντεῖχον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἔπειτα προελθόντες πέντε ἢ ἓξ σταδίους ἀνεπαύοντο ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ·
The Athenians resisted this mode of attack for a long time, but then, after advancing five or six stades, halted for rest on the plain;


7.79.6
5307
ἀνεχώρησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἐς τὸ ἑαυτῶν στρατόπεδον .
while the Syracusans also went away from them to their own camp.


7.80.1
5308
τῆς δὲ νυκτὸς τῷ Νικίᾳ καὶ Δημοσθένει ἐδόκει , ἐπειδὴ κακῶς σφίσι τὸ στράτευμα εἶχε τῶν τε ἐπιτηδείων πάντων ἀπορίᾳ ἤδη , καὶ κατατετραυματισμένοι ἦσαν πολλοὶ ἐν πολλαῖς προσβολαῖς τῶν πολεμίων γεγενημέναις , πυρὰ καύσαντας ὡς πλεῖστα ἀπάγειν τὴν στρατιάν , μηκέτι τὴν αὐτὴν ὁδὸν ᾗ διενοήθησαν , ἀλλὰ τ- ἐναντίον ἢ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐτήρουν , πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν .
During the night, their troops being in a wretched condition, both from the want of all provisions which was now felt, and from so many men being disabled by wounds in the numerous attacks that had been made upon them by the enemy, Nicias and Demosthenes determined to light as many fires as possible, and then lead off the army, no longer by the same route as they had intended, but in the opposite direction to where the Syracusans were watching for them, namely, to the sea.


7.80.2
5309
ἦν δὲ ἡ ξύμπασα ὁδὸς αὕτη οὐκ ἐπὶ Κατάνης τῷ στρατεύματι , ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸ ἕτερον μέρος τῆς Σικελίας τὸ πρὸς Καμάριναν καὶ Γέλαν καὶ τὰς ταύτῃ πόλεις καὶ Ἑλληνίδας καὶ βαρβάρους .
Now the whole of this road would lead the armament, not towards Catana, but to the other side of Sicily, to Camarina, and Gela, and the cities in that direction, whether Grecian or barbarian.


7.80.3
5310
καύσαντες οὖν πυρὰ πολλὰ ἐχώρουν ἐν τῇ νυκτί .
They kindled therefore many fires, and began their march in the night.


7.80.3
5311
καὶ αὐτοῖς , οἷον φιλεῖ καὶ πᾶσι στρατοπέδοις , μάλιστα δὲ τοῖς μεγίστοις , φόβοι καὶ δείματα ἐγγίγνεσθαι , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐν νυκτί τε καὶ διὰ πολεμίας καὶ ἀπὸ πολεμίων οὐ πολὺ ἀπεχόντων ἰοῦσιν , ἐμπίπτει ταραχή ·
And as all armies, and especially the largest, are liable to have terrors and panics produced amongst them, particularly when marching at night, and through an enemy's country, and with the enemy not far off; so they also were thrown into alarm;


7.80.4
5312
καὶ τὸ μὲν Νικίου στράτευμα ,ὥσπερ ἡγεῖτο , ξυνέμενέ τε καὶ προύλαβε πολλῷ , τὸ δὲ Δημοσθένους , τὸ ἥμισυ μάλιστα καὶ πλέον , ἀπεσπάσθη τε καὶ ἀτακτότερον ἐχώρει .
and the division of Nicias, taking the lead as it did, kept together and got a long way in advance; while that of Demosthenes, containing about half or more, was separated from the others, and proceeded in greater disorder.


7.80.5
5313
ἅμα δὲ τῇ ἕῳ ἀφικνοῦνται ὅμως πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν , καὶ ἐσβάντες ἐς τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν Ἑλωρίνην καλουμένην ἐπορεύοντο , ὅπως , ἐπειδὴ γένοιντο ἐπὶ τῷ ποταμῷ τῷ Κακυπάρει , παρὰ τὸν ποταμὸν ἴοιεν ἄνω διὰ μεσογείας ·
By the morning, nevertheless, they arrived at the sea-coast, and entering on what is called the Helorine road, continued their march, in order that when they had reached the river Cacyparis, they might march up along its banks through the interior;


7.80.5
5314
ἤλπιζον γὰρ καὶ τοὺς Σικελοὺς ταύτῃ οὓς μετεπέμψαντο ἀπαντήσεσθαι .
for they hoped also that in this direction the Sicels, to whom they had sent, would come to meet them.


7.80.6
5315
ἐπειδὴ δ’ ἐγένοντο ἐπὶ τῷ ποταμῷ , ηὗρον καὶ ἐνταῦθα φυλακήν τινα τῶν Συρακοσίων ἀποτειχίζουσάν τε καὶ ἀποσταυροῦσαν τὸν πόρον .
But when they had reached the river, they found a guard of the Syracusans there too, intercepting the pass with a wall and a palisade,


7.80.6
5316
καὶ βιασάμενοι αὐτὴν διέβησάν τε τὸν ποταμὸν καὶ ἐχώρουν αὖθις πρὸς ἄλλον ποταμὸν τὸν Ἐρινεόν ·
having carried which, they crossed the river, and marched on again to another called the Erineus;


7.80.6
5317
ταύτῃ γὰρ οἱ ἡγεμόνες ἐκέλευον .
for this was the route which their guides directed them to take.


7.81.1
5318
ἐν τούτῳ δ’ οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι , ὡς ἥ τε ἡμέρα ἐγένετο καὶ ἔγνωσαν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἀπεληλυθότας , ἐν αἰτίᾳ τε οἱ πολλοὶ τὸν Γύλιππον εἶχον ἑκόντα ἀφεῖναι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , καὶ κατὰ τάχος διώκοντες , ᾗ οὐ χαλεπῶς ᾐσθάνοντο κεχωρηκότας , καταλαμβάνουσι περὶ ἀρίστου ὥραν .
In the mean time the Syracusans and allies, as soon as it was day, and they found that the Athenians had departed, most of them charged Gylippus with having purposely let them escape; and pursuing with all haste by the route which they had no difficulty in finding they had taken, they overtook them about dinner-time.


7.81.2
5319
καὶ ὡς προσέμειξαν τοῖς μετὰ τοῦ Δημοσθένους ὑστέροις τ’ οὖσι καὶ σχολαίτερον καὶ ἀτακτότερον χωροῦσιν , ὡς τῆς νυκτὸς τότε ξυνεταράχθησαν , εὐθὺς προσπεσόντες ἐμάχοντο , καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐκυκλοῦντό τε ῥᾷον αὐτοὺς δίχα δὴ ὄντας καὶ ξυνῆγον ἐς τ- αὐτό .
When they came up with the troops under Demosthenes, which were behind the rest, and marching more slowly and disorderly, ever since they had been thrown into confusion during the night, at the time we have mentioned, they immediately fell upon and engaged them; and the Syracusan horse surrounded them with greater ease from their being divided, and confined them in a narrow space.


7.81.3
5320
τὸ δὲ Νικίου στράτευμα ἀπεῖχεν ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν καὶ πεντήκοντα σταδίους ·
The division of Nicias was as much as fifty stades off in advance;


7.81.3
5321
θᾶσσόν τε γὰρ ὁ Νικίας ἦγε , νομίζων οὐ τὸ ὑπομένειν ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ ἑκόντας εἶναι καὶ μάχεσθαι σωτηρίαν , ἀλλὰ τὸ ὡς τάχιστα ὑποχωρεῖν , τοσαῦτα μαχομένους ὅσα ἀναγκάζονται .
for he led them on more rapidly, thinking that their preservation depended, under such circumstances, not on staying behind, if they could help it, and on fighting, but on retreating as quickly as possible, and only fighting as often as they were compelled.


7.81.4
5322
ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης ἐτύγχανέ τε τὰ πλείω ἐν πόνῳ ξυνεχεστέρῳ ὢν διὰ τὸ ὑστέρῳ ἀναχωροῦντι αὐτῷ πρώτῳ ἐπικεῖσθαι τοὺς πολεμίους καὶ τότε γνοὺς τοὺς Συρακοσίους διώκοντας οὐ προυχώρει μᾶλλον ἢ ἐς μάχην ξυνετάσσετο , ἕως ἐνδιατρίβων κυκλοῦταί τε ὑπ’ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν πολλῷ θορύβῳ αὐτός τε καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ Ἀθηναῖοι ἦσαν ·
Demosthenes, on the other hand, was, generally speaking, involved in more incessant labor, (because, as he was retreating in the rear, he was the first that the enemy attacked,)


7.81.4
5323
ἀνειληθέντες γὰρ ἔς τι χωρίον ᾧ κύκλῳ μὲν τειχίον περιῆν , ὁδὸς δὲ ἔνθεν τε καὶ ἔνθεν , ἐλάας δὲ οὐκ ὀλίγας εἶχεν , ἐβάλλοντο περισταδόν .
and on that occasion, finding that the Syracusans were in pursuit, he was not so much inclined to push on, as to form his men for battle; until, through thus loitering, he was surrounded by them, and both himself and the Athenians with him were thrown into great confusion. For being driven back into a certain spot which had a wall all around it, with a road on each side, and many olive trees growing about, they were annoyed with missiles in every direction.


7.81.5
5324
τοιαύταις δὲ προσβολαῖς καὶ οὐ ξυσταδὸν μάχαις οἱ Συρακόσιοι εἰκότως ἐχρῶντο ·
This kind of attack the Syracusans naturally adopted, instead of close combat;


7.81.5
5325
τὸ γὰρ ἀποκινδυνεύειν πρὸς ἀνθρώπους ἀπονενοημένους οὐ πρὸς ἐκείνων μᾶλλον ἦν ἔτι ἢ πρὸς τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καὶ ἅμα φειδώ τέ τις ἐγίγνετο ἐπ’ εὐπραγίᾳ ἤδη σαφεῖ μὴ προαναλωθῆναί τῳ , καὶ ἐνόμιζον καὶ ὣς ταύτῃ τῇ ἰδέᾳ καταδαμασάμενοι λήψεσθαι αὐτούς .
for to risk their lives against men reduced to despair was no longer for their advantage, so much as for that of the Athenians. Besides, after success which was now so signal, each man spared himself in some degree, that he might not be cut off before the end of the business. They thought too that, even as it was, they should by this kind of fighting subdue and capture them.


7.82.1
5326
ἐπειδὴ δ’ οὖν δι’ ἡμέρας βάλλοντες πανταχόθεν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους καὶ ξυμμάχους ἑώρων ἤδη τεταλαιπωρημένους τοῖς τε τραύμασι καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ κακώσει , κήρυγμα ποιοῦνται Γύλιππος καὶ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι πρῶτον μὲν τῶν νησιωτῶν εἴ τις βούλεται ἐπ’ ἐλευθερίᾳ ὡς σφᾶς ἀπιέναι ·
At any rate, when, after plying the Athenians and their allies with missiles all day from every quarter, they saw them now distressed by wounds and other sufferings, Gylippus with the Syracusans and allies made a proclamation, in the first place, that any of the islanders who chose should come over to them, on condition of retaining his liberty:


7.82.1
5327
καὶ ἀπεχώρησάν τινες πόλεις οὐ πολλαί .
and some few states went over.


7.82.2
5328
ἔπειτα δ’ ὕστερον καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας τοὺς μετὰ Δημοσθένους ὁμολογία γίγνεται ὥστε ὅπλα τε παραδοῦναι καὶ μὴ ἀποθανεῖν μηδένα μήτε βιαίως μήτε δεσμοῖς μήτε τῆς ἀναγκαιοτάτης ἐνδείᾳ διαίτης .
Afterwards, terms were made with all the troops under Demosthenes, that they should surrender their arms, and that no one should be put to death, either by violence, or imprisonment, or want of such nourishment as was most absolutely requisite.


7.82.3
5329
καὶ παρέδοσαν οἱ πάντες σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ἑξακισχίλιοι , καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον ὃ εἶχον ἅπαν κατέθεσαν ἐσβαλόντες ἐς ἀσπίδας ὑπτίας , καὶ ἐνέπλησαν ἀσπίδας τέσσαρας .
Thus there surrendered, in all, to the number of six thousand; and the whole of the money in their possession they laid down, throwing it into the hollow of shields, four of which they filled with it.


7.82.3
5330
καὶ τούτους μὲν εὐθὺς ἀπεκόμιζον ἐς τὴν πόλιν ·
These they immediately led back to the city,


7.82.3
5331
Νικίας δὲ καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀφικνοῦνται ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμὸν τὸν Ἐρινεόν , καὶ διαβὰς πρὸς μετέωρόν τι καθῖσε τὴν στρατιάν .
while Nicias and his division arrived that day on the banks of the river Erineus; having crossed which, he posted his army on some high ground.


7.83.1
5332
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ καταλαβόντες αὐτὸν ἔλεγον ὅτι οἱ μετὰ Δημοσθένους παραδεδώκοιεν σφᾶς αὐτούς , κελεύοντες κ- ἐκεῖνον τὸ αὐτὸ δρᾶν ·
The Syracusans, having overtaken him the next day, told him that Demosthenes and his division had surrendered themselves, and called on him also to do the same.


7.83.1
5333
ὁ δ’ ἀπιστῶν σπένδεται ἱππέα πέμψαι σκεψόμενον .
Being incredulous of the fact, he obtained a truce to enable him to send a horseman to see.


7.83.2
5334
ὡς δ’ οἰχόμενος ἀπήγγειλε πάλιν παραδεδωκότας , ἐπικηρυκεύεται Γυλίππῳ καὶ Συρακοσίοις εἶναι ἑτοῖμος ὑπὲρ Ἀθηναίων ξυμβῆναι , ὅσα ἀνήλωσαν χρήματα Συρακόσιοι ἐς τὸν πόλεμον , ταῦτα ἀποδοῦναι , ὥστε τὴν μετ’ αὐτοῦ στρατιὰν ἀφεῖναι αὐτούς ·
When he had gone, and brought word back again that they had surrendered, Nicias sent a herald to Gylippus and the Syracusans, saying that he was ready to agree with the Syracusans, on behalf of the Athenians, to repay whatever money the Syracusans had spent on the war, on condition of their letting his army go;


7.83.2
5335
μέχρι οὗ δ’ ἂν τὰ χρήματα ἀποδοθῇ , ἄνδρας δώσειν Ἀθηναίων ὁμήρους , ἕνα κατὰ τάλαντον .
and that until the money was paid, he would give Athenians as hostages, one for every talent.


7.83.3
5336
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι καὶ Γύλιππος οὐ προσεδέχοντο τοὺς λόγους , ἀλλὰ προσπεσόντες καὶ περιστάντες πανταχόθεν ἔβαλλον καὶ τούτους μέχρι ὀψέ .
The Syracusans and Gylippus did not accede to these proposals, but fell upon this division also, and surrounded them on all sides, and annoyed them with their missiles until late in the day.


7.83.4
5337
εἶχον δὲ καὶ οὗτοι πονηρῶς σίτου τε καὶ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ἀπορίᾳ .
And they too, like the others, were in a wretched plight for want of food and necessaries.


7.83.4
5338
ὅμως δὲ τῆς νυκτὸς φυλάξαντες τὸ ἡσυχάζον ἔμελλον πορεύσεσθαι .
Nevertheless, they watched for the quiet of the night, and then intended to pursue their march.


7.83.4
5339
καὶ ἀναλαμβάνουσί τε τὰ ὅπλα καὶ οἱ Συρακόσιοι αἰσθάνονται καὶ ἐπαιάνισαν .
And they were now just taking up their arms, when the Syracusans perceived it and raised their paean.


7.83.5
5340
γνόντες δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ὅτι οὐ λανθάνουσι , κατέθεντο πάλιν πλὴν τριακοσίων μάλιστα ἀνδρῶν ·
The Athenians therefore, finding that they had not eluded their observation, laid their arms down again;


7.83.5
5341
οὗτοι δὲ διὰ τῶν φυλάκων βιασάμενοι ἐχώρουν τῆς νυκτὸς ᾗ ἐδύναντο .
excepting about three hundred men, who forced their way through the sentinels, and proceeded, during the night, how and where they could.


7.84.1
5342
Νικίας δ’ ἐπειδὴ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο ἦγε τὴν στρατιάν ·
As soon as it was day, Nicias led his troops forward;


7.84.1
5343
οἱ δὲ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι προσέκειντο τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον πανταχόθεν βάλλοντές τε καὶ κατακοντίζοντες .
while the Syracusans and allies pressed on them in the same manner, discharging their missiles at them, and striking them down with their javelins on every side.


7.84.2
5344
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἠπείγοντο πρὸς τὸν Ἀσσίναρον ποταμόν , ἅμα μὲν βιαζόμενοι ὑπὸ τῆς πανταχόθεν προσβολῆς ἱππέων τε πολλῶν καὶ τοῦ ἄλλου ὄχλου , οἰόμενοι ῥᾷόν τι σφίσιν ἔσεσθαι , ἢν διαβῶσι τὸν ποταμόν , ἅμα δ’ ὑπὸ τῆς ταλαιπωρίας καὶ τοῦ πιεῖν ἐπιθυμίᾳ .
The Athenians were hurrying on to reach the river Assinarus, being urged to this at once by the attack made on every side of them by the numerous cavalry and the rest of the light-armed multitude, (for they thought they should be more at ease if they were once across the river,) and also by their weariness and craving for drink.


7.84.3
5345
ὡς δὲ γίγνονται ἐπ’ αὐτῷ , ἐσπίπτουσιν οὐδενὶ κόσμῳ ἔτι , ἀλλὰ πᾶς τέ τις διαβῆναι αὐτὸς πρῶτος βουλόμενος καὶ οἱ πολέμιοι ἐπικείμενοι χαλεπὴν ἤδη τὴν διάβασιν ἐποίουν ·
When they reached its banks, they rushed into it without any more regard for order, every man anxious to be himself the first to cross it;


7.84.3
5346
ἁθρόοι γὰρ ἀναγκαζόμενοι χωρεῖν ἐπέπιπτόν τε ἀλλήλοις καὶ κατεπάτουν , περί τε τοῖς δορατίοις καὶ σκεύεσιν οἱ μὲν εὐθὺς διεφθείροντο , οἱ δὲ ἐμπαλασσόμενοι κατέρρεον .
while the attack of the enemy rendered the passage more difficult. For being compelled to advance in a dense body, they fell upon and trode down one another; and some of them died immediately on the javelins and articles of baggage, while others were entangled together, and floated down the stream.


7.84.4
5347
ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ θάτερά τε τοῦ ποταμοῦ παραστάντες οἱ Συρακόσιοι ( ἦν δὲ κρημνῶδες ) ἔβαλλον ἄνωθεν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , πίνοντάς τε τοὺς πολλοὺς ἀσμένους καὶ ἐν κοίλῳ ὄντι τῷ ποταμῷ ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ταρασσομένους .
On the other side of the river, too, the Syracusans lined the bank, which was precipitous, and from the higher ground discharged their missiles on the Athenians, while most of them were eagerly drinking, and in confusion amongst themselves in the hollow bed of the stream.


7.84.5
5348
οἵ τε Πελοποννήσιοι ἐπικαταβάντες τοὺς ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ μάλιστα ἔσφαζον .
The Peloponnesians, moreover, came down to them and butchered them, especially those in the river.


7.84.5
5349
καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ εὐθὺς διέφθαρτο , ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν ἧσσον ἐπίνετό τε ὁμοῦ τῷ πηλῷ ᾑματωμένον καὶ περιμάχητον ἦν τοῖς πολλοῖς .
And thus the water was immediately spoiled; but nevertheless it was drunk by them, mud and all, bloody as it was, and was even fought for by most of them.


7.85.1
5350
τέλος δὲ νεκρῶν τε πολλῶν ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοις ἤδη κειμένων ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ καὶ διεφθαρμένου τοῦ στρατεύματος τοῦ μὲν κατὰ τὸν ποταμόν , τοῦ δὲ καί , εἴ τι διαφύγοι , ὑπὸ τῶν ἱππέων , Νικίας Γυλίππῳ ἑαυτὸν παραδίδωσι , πιστεύσας μᾶλλον αὐτῷ ἢ τοῖς Συρακοσίοις ·
At length, when many dead were now heaped one upon another in the river, and the army was destroyed, either at the river, or, even if any part had escaped, by the cavalry, Nicias surrendered himself to Gylippus, placing more confidence in him than in the Syracusans;


7.85.1
5351
καὶ ἑαυτῷ μὲν χρήσασθαι ἐκέλευεν ἐκεῖνόν τε καὶ Λακεδαιμονίους ὅτι βούλονται , τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους στρατιώτας παύσασθαι φονεύοντας .
and desired him and the Lacedaemonians to do what they pleased with himself, but to stop butchering the rest of the soldiers. After this, Gylippus commanded to make prisoners;


7.85.2
5352
καὶ ὁ Γύλιππος μετὰ τοῦτο ζωγρεῖν ἤδη ἐκέλευεν ·
and they collected all that were alive, excepting such as they concealed for their own benefit (of whom there was a large number).


7.85.2
5353
καὶ τούς τε λοιποὺς ὅσους μὴ ἀπεκρύψαντο ( πολλοὶ δὲ οὗτοι ἐγένοντο ) ξυνεκόμισαν ζῶντας , καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς τριακοσίους , οἳ τὴν φυλακὴν διεξῆλθον τῆς νυκτός , πέμψαντες τοὺς διωξομένους ξυνέλαβον .
They also sent a party in pursuit of the three hundred, who had forced their way through the sentinels during the night, and took them.


7.85.3
5354
τὸ μὲν οὖν ἁθροισθὲν τοῦ στρατεύματος ἐς τὸ κοινὸν οὐ πολὺ ἐγένετο , τὸ δὲ διακλαπὲν πολύ , καὶ διεπλήσθη πᾶσα Σικελία αὐτῶν , ἅτε οὐκ ἀπὸ ξυμβάσεως ὥσπερ τῶν μετὰ Δημοσθένους ληφθέντων .
The part of the army, then, that was collected as general property, was not large, but that which was secreted was considerable; and the whole of Sicily was filled with them, inasmuch as they had not been taken on definite terms of surrender, like those with Demosthenes.


7.85.4
5355
μέρος δέ τι οὐκ ὀλίγον καὶ ἀπέθανεν ·
Indeed no small part was actually put to death;


7.85.4
5356
πλεῖστος γὰρ δὴ φόνος οὗτος καὶ οὐδενὸς ἐλάσσων τῶν ἐν τῷ Σικελικῷ πολέμῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο .
for this was the most extensive slaughter, and surpassed by none of all that occurred in this Sicilian war.


7.85.4
5357
καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις προσβολαῖς ταῖς κατὰ τὴν πορείαν συχναῖς γενομέναις οὐκ ὀλίγοι ἐτεθνήκεσαν .
In the other encounters also, which were frequent on their march, no few had fallen.


7.85.4
5358
πολλοὶ δὲ ὅμως καὶ διέφυγον , οἱ μὲν καὶ παραυτίκα , οἱ δὲ καὶ δουλεύσαντες καὶ διαδιδράσκοντες ὕστερον ·
But many also escaped, nevertheless; some at the moment, others after serving as slaves, and running away subsequently.


7.85.4
5359
τούτοις δ’ ἦν ἀναχώρησις ἐς Κατάνην .
These found a place of refuge at Catana.


7.86.1
5360
ξυναθροισθέντες δὲ οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι , τῶν τε αἰχμαλώτων ὅσους ἐδύναντο πλείστους καὶ τὰ σκῦλα ἀναλαβόντες , ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν πόλιν .
When the Syracusans and allies were assembled together, they took with them as many prisoners as they could, with the spoils, and returned to the city.


7.86.2
5361
καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὁπόσους ἔλαβον κατεβίβασαν ἐς τὰς λιθοτομίας , ἀσφαλεστάτην εἶναι νομίσαντες τήρησιν , Νικίαν δὲ καὶ Δημοσθένη ἄκοντος τοῦ Γυλίππου ἀπέσφαξαν .
All the rest of the Athenians and the allies that they had taken, they sent down into the quarries, thinking this the safest way of keeping them:


7.86.2
5362
ὁ γὰρ Γύλιππος καλὸν τὸ ἀγώνισμα ἐνόμιζέν οἱ εἶναι ἐπὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις καὶ τοὺς ἀντιστρατήγους κομίσαι Λακεδαιμονίοις .
but Nicias and Demosthenes they executed, against the wish of Gylippus. For he thought it would be a glorious distinction for him, in addition to all his other achievements, to take to the Lacedaemonians even the generals who had commanded against them.


7.86.3
5363
ξυνέβαινε δὲ τὸν μὲν πολεμιώτατον αὐτοῖς εἶναι , Δημοσθένη , διὰ τὰ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ καὶ Πύλῳ , τὸν δὲ διὰ τὰ αὐτὰ ἐπιτηδειότατον ·
And it so happened, that one of these, namely Demosthenes, was regarded by them as their most inveterate enemy, in consequence of what had occurred on the island and at Pylus;


7.86.3
5364
τοὺς γὰρ ἐκ τῆς νήσου ἄνδρας τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ὁ Νικίας προυθυμήθη , σπονδὰς πείσας τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ποιήσασθαι , ὥστε ἀφεθῆναι .
the other, for the same reasons, as most in their interest; for Nicias had exerted himself for the release of the Lacedaemonians taken from the island, by persuading the Athenians to make a treaty.


7.86.4
5365
ἀνθ’ ὧν οἵ τε Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἦσαν αὐτῷ προσφιλεῖς κ- ἐκεῖνος οὐχ ἥκιστα διὰ τοῦτο πιστεύσας ἑαυτὸν τῷ Γυλίππῳ παρέδωκεν .
On this account the Lacedaemonians had friendly feelings towards him; and indeed it was mainly for the same reasons that he reposed confidence in Gylippus, and surrendered himself to him.


7.86.4
5366
ἀλλὰ τῶν Συρακοσίων τινές , ὡς ἐλέγετο , οἱ μὲν δείσαντες , ὅτι πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐκεκοινολόγηντο , μὴ βασανιζόμενος διὰ τὸ τοιοῦτο ταραχὴν σφίσιν ἐν εὐπραγίᾳ ποιήσῃ , ἄλλοι δέ , καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα οἱ Κορίνθιοι , μὴ χρήμασι δὴ πείσας τινάς , ὅτι πλούσιος ἦν , ἀποδρᾷ καὶ αὖθις σφίσι νεώτερόν τι ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ γένηται , πείσαντες τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀπέκτειναν αὐτόν .
But certain of the Syracusans (as it was said) were afraid, some of them, since they had held communication with him, that if put to the torture, he might cause them trouble on that account in the midst of their success; others, and especially the Corinthians, lest he might bribe some, as he was rich, and effect his escape, and so they should again incur mischief through his agency;


7.86.5
5367
καὶ ὁ μὲν τοιαύτῃ ἢ ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τούτων αἰτίᾳ ἐτεθνήκει , ἥκιστα δὴ ἄξιος ὢν τῶν γε ἐπ’ ἐμοῦ Ἑλλήνων ἐς τοῦτο δυστυχίας ἀφικέσθαι διὰ τὴν πᾶσαν ἐς ἀρετὴν νενομισμένην ἐπιτήδευσιν .
and therefore they persuaded the allies, and put him to death. For this cause then, or something very like this, he was executed; having least of all the Greeks in my time deserved to meet with such a misfortune, on account of his devoted attention to the practice of every virtue.


7.87.1
5368
τοὺς δ’ ἐν ταῖς λιθοτομίαις οἱ Συρακόσιοι χαλεπῶς τοὺς πρώτους χρόνους μετεχείρισαν .
As for those in the quarries, the Syracusans treated them with cruelty during the first period of their captivity.


7.87.1
5369
ἐν γὰρ κοίλῳ χωρίῳ ὄντας καὶ ὀλίγῳ πολλοὺς οἵ τε ἥλιοι τὸ πρῶτον καὶ τὸ πνῖγος ἔτι ἐλύπει διὰ τὸ ἀστέγαστον καὶ αἱ νύκτες ἐπιγιγνόμεναι τ- ἐναντίον μετοπωριναὶ καὶ ψυχραὶ τῇ μεταβολῇ ἐς ἀσθένειαν ἐνεωτέριζον ,
For as they were in a hollow place, and many in a small compass, the sun, as well as the suffocating closeness, distressed them at first, in consequence of their not being under cover; and then, on the contrary, the nights coming on autumnal and cold, soon worked in them an alteration from health to disease, by means of the change.


7.87.2
5369a
πάντα τε ποιούντων αὐτῶν διὰ στενοχωρίαν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ καὶ προσέτι τῶν νεκρῶν ὁμοῦ ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοις ξυννενημένων , οἳ ἔκ τε τῶν τραυμάτων καὶ διὰ τὴν μεταβολὴν καὶ τὸ τοιοῦτον ἀπέθνῃσκον , καὶ ὀσμαὶ ἦσαν οὐκ ἀνεκτοί , καὶ λιμῷ ἅμα καὶ δίψῃ ἐπιέζοντο ( ἐδίδοσαν γὰρ αὐτῶν ἑκάστῳ ἐπὶ ὀκτὼ μῆνας κοτύλην ὕδατος καὶ δύο κοτύλας σίτου ) , ἄλλα τε ὅσα εἰκὸς ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ χωρίῳ ἐμπεπτωκότας κακοπαθῆσαι , οὐδὲν ὅτι οὐκ ἐπεγένετο αὐτοῖς ·
Since, too, in consequence of their want of room, they did every thing in the same place; and the dead, moreover, were piled up one on another—such as died from their wounds, and from the change they had experienced, and such like—there were, besides, intolerable stenches: while at the same time they were tormented with hunger and thirst; for during eight months they gave each of them daily only a of water, and two of corn. And of all the other miseries which it was likely that men thrown into such a place would suffer, there was none that did not fall to their lot.


7.87.3
5370
καὶ ἡμέρας μὲν ἑβδομήκοντά τινας οὕτω διῃτήθησαν ἁθρόοι ·
For some seventy days they thus lived all together;


7.87.3
5371
ἔπειτα πλὴν Ἀθηναίων καὶ εἴ τινες Σικελιωτῶν ἢ Ἰταλιωτῶν ξυνεστράτευσαν , τοὺς ἄλλους ἀπέδοντο .
but then they sold the rest of them, except the Athenians, and whatever Siceliots or Italiots had joined them in the expedition.


7.87.4
5372
ἐλήφθησαν δὲ οἱ ξύμπαντες , ἀκριβείᾳ μὲν χαλεπὸν ἐξειπεῖν , ὅμως δὲ οὐκ ἐλάσσους ἑπτακισχιλίων .
The total number of those who were taken, though it were difficult to speak with exactness, was still not less than seven thousand.


7.87.5
5373
ξυνέβη τε ἔργον τοῦτο Ἑλληνικὸν τῶν κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον τόνδε μέγιστον γενέσθαι , δοκεῖν δ’ ἔμοιγε καὶ ὧν ἀκοῇ Ἑλληνικῶν ἴσμεν , καὶ τοῖς τε κρατήσασι λαμπρότατον καὶ τοῖς διαφθαρεῖσι δυστυχέστατον ·
And this was the greatest Grecian exploit of all that were performed in this war; nay, in my opinion, of all Grecian achievements that we have heard of also; and was at once most splendid for the conquerors, and most disastrous for the conquered.


7.87.6
5374
κατὰ πάντα γὰρ πάντως νικηθέντες καὶ οὐδὲν ὀλίγον ἐς οὐδὲν κακοπαθήσαντες πανωλεθρίᾳ δὴ τὸ λεγόμενον καὶ πεζὸς καὶ νῆες καὶ οὐδὲν ὅτι οὐκ ἀπώλετο , καὶ ὀλίγοι ἀπὸ πολλῶν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀπενόστησαν .
For being altogether vanquished at all points, and having suffered in no slight degree in any respect, they were destroyed (as the saying is) with utter destruction, both army, and navy, and every thing; and only a few out of many returned home.


7.87.6
5375
ταῦτα μὲν τὰ περὶ Σικελίαν γενόμενα .
Such were the events which occurred in Sicily.



8.1.1
5376
ἐς δὲ τὰς Ἀθήνας ἐπειδὴ ἠγγέλθη , ἐπὶ πολὺ μὲν ἠπίστουν καὶ τοῖς πάνυ τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἐξ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἔργου διαπεφευγόσι καὶ σαφῶς ἀγγέλλουσι , μὴ οὕτω γε ἄγαν πανσυδὶ διεφθάρθαι ·
WHEN the news was brought to Athens, for a long time they disbelieved even the most respectable of the soldiers, who had escaped from the very scene of action, and gave them a correct account of it; not crediting that their forces could have been so utterly destroyed.


8.1.1
5377
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἔγνωσαν , χαλεποὶ μὲν ἦσαν τοῖς ξυμπροθυμηθεῖσι τῶν ῥητόρων τὸν ἔκπλουν , ὥσπερ οὐκ αὐτοὶ ψηφισάμενοι , ὠργίζοντο δὲ καὶ τοῖς χρησμολόγοις τε καὶ μάντεσι καὶ ὁπόσοι τι τότε αὐτοὺς θειάσαντες ἐπήλπισαν ὡς λήψονται Σικελίαν .
When, however, they were convinced of it, they were angry with those of the orators who had joined in promoting the expedition; (as though they had not voted for it themselves;) and were enraged with the soothsayers and reciters of oracles, and whoever at that time by any practice of divination had put them on hoping that they should subdue Sicily.


8.1.2
5378
πάντα δὲ πανταχόθεν αὐτοὺς ἐλύπει τε καὶ περιειστήκει ἐπὶ τῷ γεγενημένῳ φόβος τε καὶ κατάπληξις μεγίστη δή .
Every thing, indeed, on every side distressed them; and after what had happened, fear and the greatest consternation overwhelmed them.


8.1.2
5379
ἅμα μὲν γὰρ στερόμενοι καὶ ἰδίᾳ ἕκαστος καὶ ἡ πόλις ὁπλιτῶν τε πολλῶν καὶ ἱππέων καὶ ἡλικίας οἵαν οὐχ ἑτέραν ἑώρων ὑπάρχουσαν ἐβαρύνοντο ·
For they were at once weighed down by the loss which every man individually, as well as the whole state at large, had experienced, by the destruction of so many heavy-armed, and horsemen, and troops in the flower of their youth, like which they saw they had none left;


8.1.2
5380
ἅμα δὲ ναῦς οὐχ ὁρῶντες ἐν τοῖς νεωσοίκοις ἱκανὰς οὐδὲ χρήματα ἐν τῷ κοινῷ οὐδ’ ὑπηρεσίας ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀνέλπιστοι ἦσαν ἐν τῷ παρόντι σωθήσεσθαι , τούς τε ἀπὸ τῆς Σικελίας πολεμίους εὐθὺς σφίσιν ἐνόμιζον τῷ ναυτικῷ ἐπὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ πλευσεῖσθαι , ἄλλως τε καὶ τοσοῦτον κρατήσαντας , καὶ τοὺς αὐτόθεν πολεμίους τότε δὴ καὶ διπλασίως πάντα παρεσκευασμένους κατὰ κράτος ἤδη καὶ ἐκ γῆς καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ἐπικείσεσθαι , καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους σφῶν μετ’ αὐτῶν ἀποστάντας .
and at the same time being aware that they had no competent number of ships in the docks, nor money in the treasury, nor crews for their vessels, they were at present without hope of saving themselves. They thought, too, that they should have their enemies in Sicily directly sailing with their fleet against the Piraeus, especially after they had gained such a victory; and that their foes at home, then doubly equipped on all points, would surely now press them with all their might, both by land and by sea, and their own allies with them in revolt.


8.1.3
5381
ὅμως δὲ ὡς ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ἐδόκει χρῆναι μὴ ἐνδιδόναι , ἀλλὰ παρασκευάζεσθαι καὶ ναυτικόν , ὅθεν ἂν δύνωνται ξύλα ξυμπορισαμένους , καὶ χρήματα , καὶ τὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐς ἀσφάλειαν ποιεῖσθαι , καὶ μάλιστα τὴν Εὔβοιαν , τῶν τε κατὰ τὴν πόλιν τι ἐς εὐτέλειαν σωφρονίσαι , καὶ ἀρχήν τινα πρεσβυτέρων ἀνδρῶν ἑλέσθαι , οἵτινες περὶ τῶν παρόντων ὡς ἂν καιρὸς ᾖ προβουλεύσουσιν .
But nevertheless it was determined, that, as far as their present resources allowed, they ought not to submit, but to equip a fleet, by whatever means they could, providing by contribution both timber and money; and to put matters on a secure footing amongst the allies, especially in Euboea: and, moreover, to reform every thing in the city, with a view to greater economy, and elect a council of elders, who should deliberate beforehand on their present measures, as there might be occasion.


8.1.4
5382
πάντα τε πρὸς τὸ παραχρῆμα περιδεές , ὅπερ φιλεῖ δῆμος ποιεῖν , ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν εὐτακτεῖν .
And through their excessive fear at the moment they were ready, (as is the people's fashion,) to be orderly in every thing.


8.1.4
5383
καὶ ὡς ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς , καὶ ἐποίουν ταῦτα , καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
Having thus determined, they acted accordingly, and so the summer ended.


8.2.1
5384
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος πρὸς τὴν ἐκ τῆς Σικελίας τῶν Ἀθηναίων μεγάλην κακοπραγίαν εὐθὺς οἱ Ἕλληνες πάντες ἐπηρμένοι ἦσαν , οἱ μὲν μηδετέρων ὄντες ξύμμαχοι , ὡς , ἤν τις καὶ μὴ παρακαλῇ σφᾶς , οὐκ ἀποστατέον ἔτι τοῦ πολέμου εἴη , ἀλλ’ ἐθελοντὶ ἰτέον ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , νομίσαντες κἂν ἐπὶ σφᾶς ἕκαστοι ἐλθεῖν αὐτούς , εἰ τὰ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ κατώρθωσαν , καὶ ἅμα βραχὺν ἔσεσθαι τὸν λοιπὸν πόλεμον , οὗ μετασχεῖν καλὸν εἶναι , οἱ δ’ αὖ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ξύμμαχοι ξυμπροθυμηθέντες ἐπὶ πλέον ἢ πρὶν ἀπαλλάξεσθαι διὰ τάχους πολλῆς ταλαιπωρίας .
The following winter, all the Greeks were immediately excited by the great misfortune of the Athenians in Sicily. Those who were not in alliance with either side thought, that even f no one called on them for aid, they ought not any longer to keep aloof from the war, but should volunteer to march against the Athenians, when they reflected, severally, that they might have attacked  also, if they had succeeded in their measures at Syracuse; and, moreover, that the remainder of the war would be but brief, and that it was creditable for them to take their share in it. The allies of the Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, felt to a greater degree than before a common anxiety to have done speedily with their heavy labours.


8.2.2
5385
μάλιστα δὲ οἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὑπήκοοι ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν καὶ παρὰ δύναμιν αὐτῶν ἀφίστασθαι διὰ τὸ ὀργῶντες κρίνειν τὰ πράγματα καὶ μηδ’ ὑπολείπειν λόγον αὐτοῖς ὡς τό γ’ ἐπιὸν θέρος οἷοί τ’ ἔσονται περιγενέσθαι .
But, above all, the subjects of the Athenians were ready, even beyond their power, to revolt from them; because they judged of affairs under the influence of strong feeling, and did not so much as leave them a chance of being able to hold out the following summer.


8.2.3
5386
ἡ δὲ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων πόλις πᾶσί τε τούτοις ἐθάρσει καὶ μάλιστα ὅτι οἱ ἐκ τῆς Σικελίας αὐτοῖς ξύμμαχοι πολλῇ δυνάμει , κατ’ ἀνάγκην ἤδη τοῦ ναυτικοῦ προσγεγενημένου , ἅμα τῷ ἦρι ὡς εἰκὸς παρέσεσθαι ἔμελλον .
The Lacedaemonian state was encouraged by all these things, and most of all, because their allies in Sicily, since their navy had now of necessity been added to their resources, would in all probability be with them in great force with the spring.


8.2.4
5387
πανταχόθεν τε εὐέλπιδες ὄντες ἀπροφασίστως ἅπτεσθαι διενοοῦντο τοῦ πολέμου , λογιζόμενοι καλῶς τελευτήσαντος αὐτοῦ κινδύνων τε τοιούτων ἀπηλλάχθαι ἂν τὸ λοιπὸν οἷος καὶ ὁ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων περιέστη ἂν αὐτούς , εἰ τὸ Σικελικὸν προσέλαβον , καὶ καθελόντες ἐκείνους αὐτοὶ τῆς πάσης Ἑλλάδος ἤδη ἀσφαλῶς ἡγήσεσθαι .
And thus being on every account full of hope, they determined to devote themselves unflinchingly to the war, reckoning that by its successful termination they would both be released in future from all dangers, like that which would have encompassed them from the Athenians, if they had won Sicily in addition to their other dominion; and that, after subduing them, they would themselves then enjoy n safety the supremacy over the whole of Greece.


8.3.1
5388
εὐθὺς οὖν Ἆγις μὲν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ ὁρμηθεὶς στρατῷ τινὶ ἐκ Δεκελείας τά τε τῶν ξυμμάχων ἠργυρολόγησεν ἐς τὸ ναυτικὸν καὶ τραπόμενος ἐπὶ τοῦ Μηλιῶς κόλπου Οἰταίων τε κατὰ τὴν παλαιὰν ἔχθραν τῆς λείας τὴν πολλὴν ἀπολαβὼν χρήματα ἐπράξατο , καὶ Ἀχαιοὺς τοὺς Φθιώτας καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους τοὺς ταύτῃ Θεσσαλῶν ὑπηκόους μεμφομένων καὶ ἀκόντων τῶν Θεσσαλῶν ὁμήρους τέ τινας ἠνάγκασε δοῦναι καὶ χρήματα , καὶ κατέθετο τοὺς ὁμήρους ἐς Κόρινθον , ἔς τε τὴν ξυμμαχίαν ἐπειρᾶτο προσάγειν .
Agis, their king, set out therefore immediately, during his winter, with some troops from Decelea, and levied from the allies contributions for their fleet; and having turned in the direction of the Malian gulf, and carried off, on the ground of their long-standing enmity, the greater part of the exposed property of the Oetaeans, he exacted money for the ransom of it; and also compelled the Achaeans of Pthiotis, and the other subjects of the Thessalians thereabouts, (though the Thessalians remonstrated with him, and objected to it,) to give both hostages and money; the former of which he deposited at Corinth, and endeavoured to bring their countrymen over to the confederacy.


8.3.2
5389
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ τὴν πρόσταξιν ταῖς πόλεσιν ἑκατὸν νεῶν τῆς ναυπηγίας ἐποιοῦντο , καὶ ἑαυτοῖς μὲν καὶ Βοιωτοῖς πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν ἑκατέροις ἔταξαν , Φωκεῦσι δὲ καὶ Λοκροῖς πέντε καὶ δέκα , καὶ Κορινθίοις πέντε καὶ δέκα , Ἀρκάσι δὲ καὶ Πελληνεῦσι καὶ Σικυωνίοις δέκα , Μεγαρεῦσι δὲ καὶ Τροιζηνίοις καὶ Ἐπιδαυρίοις καὶ Ἑρμιονεῦσι δέκα ·
The Lacedaemonians also issued to the states a requisition for building a hundred ships, fixing their own quota and that of the Boeotians at five and twenty each; that of the Phocians and Locrians together at fifteen; that of the Corinthians at fifteen; that of the Arcadians, Pellenians, and Sicyonians, at ten; and that of the Megareans, Troezenians, Epidaurians, and Hermionians at ten.


8.3.2
5390
τά τε ἄλλα παρεσκευάζοντο ὡς εὐθὺς πρὸς τὸ ἔαρ ἑξόμενοι τοῦ πολέμου .
They were also making all other preparations, with the intention of proceeding immediately to war at the very commencement of spring.


8.4.1
5391
παρεσκευάζοντο δὲ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὥσπερ διενοήθησαν , ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ τήν τε ναυπηγίαν , ξύλα ξυμπορισάμενοι , καὶ Σούνιον τειχίσαντες , ὅπως αὐτοῖς ἀσφάλεια ταῖς σιταγωγοῖς ναυσὶν εἴη τοῦ περίπλου , καὶ τό τε ἐν τῇ Λακωνικῇ τείχισμα ἐκλιπόντες ὃ ἐνῳκοδόμησαν παραπλέοντες ἐς Σικελίαν , καὶ τ- ἄλλα , εἴ πού τι ἐδόκει ἀχρεῖον ἀναλίσκεσθαι , ξυστελλόμενοι ἐς εὐτέλειαν , μάλιστα δὲ τὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων διασκοποῦντες ὅπως μὴ σφῶν ἀποστήσονται .
The Athenians too, as they had determined, were preparing during this same winter for building ships; having contributed towards the supply of timbers, and fortified Sunium, that their corn-ships might have a safe passage round; while they also evacuated the fort in Laconia, which they had built in that country when they were sailing by it for Sicily; and with a view to economy retrenched all their other expenses, whatever any where appeared to be useless expenditure; and, above all, kept their eye on the allies, to prevent their revolting from them.


8.5.1
5392
πρασσόντων δὲ ταῦτα ἀμφοτέρων καὶ ὄντων οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἢ ὥσπερ ἀρχομένων ἐν κατασκευῇ τοῦ πολέμου , πρῶτοι Εὐβοῆς ὡς Ἆγιν περὶ ἀποστάσεως τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπρεσβεύσαντο ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ .
While both parties were carrying out these measures, and engaged in preparation for the war, just as when they were commencing it, the Euboeans, first of all, sent during this winter an embassy to Agis, to treat of their revolting from the Athenians.


8.5.1
5393
ὁ δὲ προσδεξάμενος τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν μεταπέμπεται ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος Ἀλκαμένη τὸν Σθενελαΐδου καὶ Μέλανθον ἄρχοντας ὡς ἐς τὴν Εὔβοιαν ·
He acceded to their proposals, and sent for Alcamenes son of Sthenelaidas, and for Melanthus, to come from Sparta and take the command in Euboea.


8.5.1
5394
οἱ δ’ ἦλθον ἔχοντες τῶν νεοδαμωδῶν ὡς τριακοσίους , καὶ παρεσκεύαζεν αὐτοῖς τὴν διάβασιν .
Accordingly they came with about three hundred of the Neodamodes, and he began to prepare for their crossing over.


8.5.2
5395
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ καὶ Λέσβιοι ἦλθον βουλόμενοι καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀποστῆναι ·
But in the mean time some Lesbians also came to him; for they, too, wished to revolt.


8.5.2
5396
καὶ ξυμπρασσόντων αὐτοῖς τῶν Βοιωτῶν ἀναπείθεται Ἆγις ὥστε Εὐβοίας μὲν πέρι ἐπισχεῖν , τοῖς δὲ Λεσβίοις παρεσκεύαζε τὴν ἀπόστασιν , Ἀλκαμένη τε ἁρμοστὴν διδούς , ὃς ἐς Εὔβοιαν πλεῖν ἔμελλε , καὶ δέκα μὲν Βοιωτοὶ ναῦς ὑπέσχοντο , δέκα δὲ Ἆγις .
And as the Boeotians supported their application, Agis was persuaded to defer acting in the cause of Euboea, and made preparations for the revolt of the Lesbians, giving them Alcamenes as a commander, who was to sail to Euboea; while the Boeotians promised them ten ships, and Agis the same number.


8.5.3
5397
καὶ ταῦτα ἄνευ τῆς Λακεδαιμονίων πόλεως ἐπράσσετο ·
These measures were undertaken without the authority of the Lacedaemonian state;


8.5.3
5398
ὁ γὰρ Ἆγις , ὅσον χρόνον ἦν περὶ Δεκέλειαν ἔχων τὴν μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ δύναμιν , κύριος ἦν καὶ ἀποστέλλειν εἴ ποί τινα ἐβούλετο στρατιὰν καὶ ξυναγείρειν καὶ χρήματα πράσσειν .
for as long as Agis was at Decelea, and his forces with him, he had power both to send troops to whatever quarter he pleased, and to levy soldiers and money.


8.5.3
5399
καὶ πολὺ μᾶλλον ὡς εἰπεῖν κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν καιρὸν αὐτοῦ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ὑπήκουον ἢ τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει Λακεδαιμονίων ·
And at this time the allies obeyed him, one might say, much more than the Lacedaemonians in the city:


8.5.3
5400
δύναμιν γὰρ ἔχων αὐτὸς εὐθὺς ἑκασταχόσε δεινὸς παρῆν .
for he was feared, because he went every where in person with a force at his command. He, then, furthered the views of the Lesbians. The Chians and Erythraeans, on the other hand, who were also ready to revolt, made their application, not to Agis, but at Sparta.


8.5.4
5401
καὶ ὁ μὲν τοῖς Λεσβίοις ἔπρασσε , Χῖοι δὲ καὶ Ἐρυθραῖοι ἀποστῆναι καὶ αὐτοὶ ἑτοῖμοι ὄντες πρὸς μὲν Ἆγιν οὐκ ἐτράποντο , ἐς δὲ τὴν Λακεδαίμονα .
There went with them also an ambassador from Tissaphernes, who was governor of the sea-coast under king Darius, son of Artaxerxes.


8.5.4
5402
καὶ παρὰ Τισσαφέρνους , ὃς βασιλεῖ Δαρείῳ τῷ Ἀρταξέρξου στρατηγὸς ἦν τῶν κάτω , πρεσβευτὴς ἅμα μετ’ αὐτῶν παρῆν .
For Tissaphernes also was inviting the Lacedaemonians to co-operate with him, and promised to furnish them with supplies.


8.5.5
5403
ἐπήγετο γὰρ καὶ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης τοὺς Πελοποννησίους καὶ ὑπισχνεῖτο τροφὴν παρέξειν .
For he had lately been called on by the king for the tribute due from his government, for which he was in arrears, as he could not raise it from the Greek cities because of the Athenians.


8.5.5
5404
ὑπὸ βασιλέως γὰρ νεωστὶ ἐτύγχανε πεπραγμένος τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ ἀρχῆς φόρους , οὓς δι’ Ἀθηναίους ἀπὸ τῶν Ἑλληνίδων πόλεων οὐ δυνάμενος πράσσεσθαι ἐπωφείλησεν ·
He thought, therefore, that he should both get in his tribute more effectually, if he reduced the power of the Athenians;


8.5.5
5405
τούς τε οὖν φόρους μᾶλλον ἐνόμιζε κομιεῖσθαι κακώσας τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , καὶ ἅμα βασιλεῖ ξυμμάχους Λακεδαιμονίους ποιήσειν , καὶ Ἀμόργην τὸν Πισσούθνου υἱὸν νόθον , ἀφεστῶτα περὶ Καρίαν , ὥσπερ αὐτῷ προσέταξε βασιλεύς , ἢ ζῶντα ἄξειν ἢ ἀποκτενεῖν .
and at the same time should gain for the king the alliance of the Lacedaemonians; and either take alive, or put to death, as the king had commanded him to do, Amorges, the natural son of Pisuthnes, who was in rebellion on the coast of Caria. The Chians and Tissaphernes, then, were negotiating this business in concert.


8.6.1
5406
οἱ μὲν οὖν Χῖοι καὶ Τισσαφέρνης κοινῇ κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ ἔπρασσον , Καλλίγειτος δὲ ὁ Λαοφῶντος Μεγαρεὺς καὶ Τιμαγόρας ὁ Ἀθηναγόρου Κυζικηνός , φυγάδες τῆς ἑαυτῶν ἀμφότεροι παρὰ Φαρναβάζῳ τῷ Φαρνάκου κατοικοῦντες , ἀφικνοῦνται περὶ τὸν αὐτὸν καιρὸν ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πέμψαντος Φαρναβάζου , ὅπως ναῦς κομίσειαν ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον , καὶ αὐτός , εἰ δύναιτο , ἅπερ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης προυθυμεῖτο , τάς τε ἐν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ ἀρχῇ πόλεις ἀποστήσειε τῶν Ἀθηναίων διὰ τοὺς φόρους καὶ ἀφ’ ἑαυτοῦ βασιλεῖ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ποιήσειεν .
About the same time Calligitus son of Laophon, a Megarean, and Timagoras son of Athenagoras, a Cyzicene, both of them exiles from their country, and living at the court of Pharnabazus son of Pharnaces, arrived at Lacedaemon, being sent by Pharnabazus to bring a fleet despatched to the Hellespont; and that he himself, if possible, might, for the sake of the tribute, cause the cities in his government to revolt from the Athenians—the same object as Tissaphernes had in view—and gain for the king, by his own agency, the alliance of the Lacedaemonians.


8.6.2
5407
πρασσόντων δὲ ταῦτα χωρὶς ἑκατέρων , τῶν τε ἀπὸ τοῦ Φαρναβάζου καὶ τῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ Τισσαφέρνους , πολλὴ ἅμιλλα ἐγίγνετο τῶν ἐν τῇ Λακεδαίμονι , ὅπως οἱ μὲν ἐς τὴν Ἰωνίαν καὶ Χίον , οἱ δ’ ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον πρότερον ναῦς καὶ στρατιὰν πείσουσι πέμπειν .
While these negotiations were severally carried on by each party, by the emissaries both of Pharnabazus and of Tissaphernes, there was great competition between them at Lacedaemon, the one striving to prevail on them to send a navy and army to Ionia and Chios first, the other, to the Hellespont.


8.6.3
5408
οἱ μέντοι Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὰ τῶν Χίων καὶ Τισσαφέρνους παρὰ πολὺ προσεδέξαντο μᾶλλον ·
The Lacedaemonians, however, acceded with a very decided preference to the application of the Chians and Tissaphernes.


8.6.3
5409
ξυνέπρασσε γὰρ αὐτοῖς καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδης , Ἐνδίῳ ἐφορεύοντι πατρικὸς ἐς τὰ μάλιστα ξένος ὤν , ὅθεν καὶ τ- ὄνομα Λακωνικὸν ἡ οἰκία αὐτῶν κατὰ τὴν ξενίαν ἔσχεν ·
For Alcibiades was also co-operating with them, being the hereditary and very intimate friend of Endius, one of the ephors;


8.6.3
5410
Ἔνδιος γὰρ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἐκαλεῖτο .
for which reason also his family had a Lacedaemonian name, in consequence of this friendship;


8.6.4
5411
ὅμως δ’ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι πρῶτον κατάσκοπον ἐς τὴν Χίον πέμψαντες Φρῦνιν ἄνδρα περίοικον , εἰ αἵ τε νῆες αὐτοῖς εἰσὶν ὅσασπερ ἔλεγον καὶ τ- ἄλλα εἰ ἡ πόλις ἱκανή ἐστι πρὸς τὴν λεγομένην δόξαν , ἀπαγγείλαντος αὐτοῖς ὡς εἴη ταῦτα ἀληθῆ ἅπερ ἤκουον , τούς τε Χίους καὶ τοὺς Ἐρυθραίους εὐθὺς ξυμμάχους ἐποιήσαντο καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς ἐψηφίσαντο αὐτοῖς πέμπειν , ὡς ἐκεῖ οὐκ ἔλασσον ἢ ἑξήκοντα ἀφ’ ὧν οἱ Χῖοι ἔλεγον ὑπαρχουσῶν .
for Endius was called " the son of Alcibiades."  However, the Lacedaemonians first sent to Chios Phrynis, one of the  to ascertain whether they had as many ships as they said, and whether their city corresponded with the representations of its high character: and when he brought them word back that what they heard was true, they straightway took the Chians and Erythraeans into alliance, and resolved to send them forty ships, as there were already there (according to the statement of the Chians) not less than sixty.


8.6.5
5412
καὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον δέκα τούτων αὐτοὶ ἔμελλον πέμψειν , καὶ Μελαγχρίδαν , ὃς αὐτοῖς ναύαρχος ἦν ·
Of these they themselves at first intended to send ten, with Melancridas, who was their high admiral;


8.6.5
5413
ἔπειτα σεισμοῦ γενομένου ἀντὶ τοῦ Μελαγχρίδου Χαλκιδέα ἔπεμπον καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν δέκα νεῶν πέντε παρεσκευάζοντο ἐν τῇ Λακωνικῇ .
but afterwards, an earthquake having occurred, instead of Melancridas they determined to send Chalcideus, and instead of the ten ships to equip but five in Laconia.


8.6.5
5414
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα καὶ ἑνὸς δέον εἰκοστὸν ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
And thus the winter ended, and the nineteenth year of this war of which Thucydides wrote the history.


8.7.1
5415
ἅμα δὲ τῷ ἦρι τοῦ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους εὐθὺς ἐπειγομένων τῶν Χίων ἀποστεῖλαι τὰς ναῦς καὶ δεδιότων μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ πρασσόμενα αἴσθωνται ( πάντες γὰρ κρύφα αὐτῶν ἐπρεσβεύοντο ) , ἀποπέμπουσιν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐς Κόρινθον ἄνδρας Σπαρτιάτας τρεῖς , ὅπως ἀπὸ τῆς ἑτέρας θαλάσσης ὡς τάχιστα ἐπὶ τὴν πρὸς Ἀθήνας ὑπερενεγκόντες τὰς ναῦς τὸν Ἰσθμὸν κελεύσωσι πλεῖν ἐς Χίον πάσας , καὶ ἃς ὁ Ἆγις παρεσκεύαζεν ἐς τὴν Λέσβον καὶ τὰς ἄλλας ·
The following summer, when the Chians straightway urged them to despatch the fleet, and were afraid that the Athenians might get intelligence of their measures, (for all parties sent their embassies without knowledge,) the Lacedaemonians sent three Spartans to Corinth, to haul the ships as quickly as possible across the isthmus, from the opposite sea to that on the side of Athens, and to give orders for them all to sail to Chios, both those which Agis was preparing for Lesbos, and the rest.


8.7.1
5416
ἦσαν δὲ αἱ ξύμπασαι τῶν ξυμμαχίδων νῆες αὐτόθι μιᾶς δέουσαι τεσσαράκοντα .
Now the total number of the ships belonging to the allied states that were there was thirty-nine.


8.8.1
5417
ὁ μὲν οὖν Καλλίγειτος καὶ Τιμαγόρας ὑπὲρ τοῦ Φαρναβάζου οὐκ ἐκοινοῦντο τὸν στόλον ἐς τὴν Χίον , οὐδὲ τὰ χρήματα ἐδίδοσαν ἃ ἦλθον ἔχοντες ἐς τὴν ἀποστολὴν πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι τάλαντα , ἀλλ’ ὕστερον ἐφ’ ἑαυτῶν διενοοῦντο ἄλλῳ στόλῳ πλεῖν ·
Calligitus, then, and Timagoras, acting in behalf of Pharnabazus, did not join the rest in the expedition to Chios, or give, to forward the despatch of the fleet, the money which they had brought with them, namely, five and twenty talents; but they intended to sail afterwards by themselves with a fresh armament.


8.8.2
5418
ὁ δὲ Ἆγις ἐπειδὴ ἑώρα τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἐς τὴν Χίον πρῶτον ὡρμημένους , οὐδ’ αὐτὸς ἄλλο τι ἐγίγνωσκεν , ἀλλὰ ξυνελθόντες ἐς Κόρινθον οἱ ξύμμαχοι ἐβουλεύοντο , καὶ ἔδοξε πρῶτον ἐς Χίον αὐτοῖς πλεῖν ἄρχοντα ἔχοντας Χαλκιδέα , ὃς ἐν τῇ Λακωνικῇ τὰς πέντε ναῦς παρεσκεύαζεν , ἔπειτα ἐς Λέσβον καὶ Ἀλκαμένη ἄρχοντα , ὅνπερ καὶ Ἆγις διενοεῖτο , τὸ τελευταῖον δὲ ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ἀφικέσθαι ( προσετέτακτο δὲ ἐς αὐτὸν ἄρχων Κλέαρχος ὁ Ῥαμφίου ) , διαφέρειν δὲ τὸν Ἰσθμὸν τὰς ἡμισείας τῶν νεῶν πρῶτον , καὶ εὐθὺς ταύτας ἀποπλεῖν , ὅπως μὴ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι πρὸς τὰς ἀφορμωμένας μᾶλλον τὸν νοῦν ἔχωσιν ἢ τὰς ὕστερον ἐπιδιαφερομένας .
Agis, on the contrary, seeing that the Lacedaemonians were determined to send to Chios first, did not himself maintain any different view; but the allies assembled at Corinth, and held a council, when they resolved to sail first to Chios, with Chalcideus as commander, who was equipping the five vessels in Laconia; then to Lesbos, with Alcamenes in command, (the same person as Agis intended to appoint;) and, lastly, to go to the Hellespont, where Clearchus, son of Ramphias, was appointed to the command.


8.8.4
5419
καὶ γὰρ τὸν πλοῦν ταύτῃ ἐκ τοῦ προφανοῦς ἐποιοῦντο , καταφρονήσαντες τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀδυνασίαν , ὅτι ναυτικὸν οὐδὲν αὐτῶν πολύ πω ἐφαίνετο .
For in this case they were making their expedition openly, as they imputed to the Athenians a want of power to oppose them, because no numerous fleet belonging to them was yet visible.


8.8.4
5420
ὡς δὲ ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς , καὶ διεκόμισαν εὐθὺς μίαν καὶ εἴκοσι ναῦς .
And so, according to their resolution, they immediately took across one and twenty ships.


8.9.1
5421
οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι , ἐπειγομένων αὐτῶν τὸν πλοῦν , οὐ προυθυμήθησαν ξυμπλεῖν πρὶν τὰ Ἴσθμια , ἃ τότε ἦν , διεορτάσωσιν .
But when they were urgent for setting sail, the Corinthians were not disposed to accompany them before they had kept the Isthmian festival, for which that was the time.


8.9.1
5422
Ἆγις δὲ αὐτοῖς ἑτοῖμος ἦν ἐκείνους μὲν μὴ λύειν δὴ τὰς Ἰσθμιάδας σπονδάς , ἑαυτοῦ δὲ τὸν στόλον ἴδιον ποιήσασθαι .
Agis expressed to them his willingness that they (according to what they urged) should not break the Isthmian truce, but that he should make the expedition on his own responsibility.


8.9.2
5423
οὐ ξυγχωρούντων δὲ τῶν Κορινθίων , ἀλλὰ διατριβῆς ἐγγιγνομένης , οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ᾐσθάνοντο τὰ τῶν Χίων μᾶλλον , καὶ πέμψαντες ἕνα τῶν στρατηγῶν Ἀριστοκράτη ἐπῃτιῶντο αὐτούς , καὶ ἀρνουμένων τῶν Χίων τὸ πιστὸν ναῦς σφίσι ξυμπέμπειν ἐκέλευον ἐς τὸ ξυμμαχικόν ·
When, however, the Corinthians did not agree to this, but a delay was caused in the matter, the Athenians the more easily gained intelligence of the designs of the Chians; and sending Aristocrates, one of their generals, charged them with the fact, and on their denying it, commanded them to send with them some ships, as a pledge of good faith in their alliance.


8.9.2
5424
οἱ δ’ ἔπεμψαν ἑπτά .
The Chians sent seven.


8.9.3
5425
αἴτιον δ’ ἐγένετο τῆς ἀποστολῆς τῶν νεῶν οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ τῶν Χίων οὐκ εἰδότες τὰ πρασσόμενα , οἱ δὲ ὀλίγοι καὶ ξυνειδότες τό τε πλῆθος οὐ βουλόμενοί πω πολέμιον ἔχειν , πρίν τι καὶ ἰσχυρὸν λάβωσι , καὶ τοὺς Πελοποννησίους οὐκέτι προσδεχόμενοι ἥξειν , ὅτι διέτριβον .
Accordingly they sent seven. The reason of the ships being sent was, that the majority of the Chians were ignorant of the negotiations; while the few who were privy to them were both unwilling at present to incur the hostility of their commons, before they had gained some strength, and no longer expected the Peloponnesians to come, since they had so long delayed.


8.10.1
5426
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ τὰ Ἴσθμια ἐγίγνετο , καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ( ἐπηγγέλθησαν γάρ ) ἐθεώρουν ἐς αὐτά , καὶ κατάδηλα μᾶλλον αὐτοῖς τὰ τῶν Χίων ἐφάνη .
In the mean time the Isthmian games were being celebrated, and the Athenians (the sacred truce having been proclaimed) went to attend them; and thus the designs of the Chians became more evident to them.


8.10.1
5427
καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἀνεχώρησαν , παρεσκευάζοντο εὐθὺς ὅπως μὴ λήσουσιν αὐτοὺς αἱ νῆες ἐκ τῶν Κεγχρειῶν ἀφορμηθεῖσαι .
When they returned, they immediately took measures that the fleet might not put out from Cenchrea unobserved by them.


8.10.2
5428
οἱ δὲ μετὰ τὴν ἑορτὴν ἀνήγοντο μιᾷ καὶ εἴκοσι ναυσὶν ἐς τὴν Χίον , ἄρχοντα Ἀλκαμένη ἔχοντες .
After the festival the Peloponnesians set sail for Chios with one and twenty ships under the command of Alcamenes;


8.10.2
5429
καὶ αὐτοῖς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὸ πρῶτον ἴσαις ναυσὶ προσπλεύσαντες ὑπῆγον ἐς τὸ πέλαγος .
and the Athenians, having at first advanced against them with an equal number, then began to retreat towards the open sea.


8.10.2
5430
ὡς δ’ ἐπὶ πολὺ οὐκ ἐπηκολούθησαν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι , ἀλλ’ ἀπετράποντο , ἐπανεχώρησαν καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ·
When the enemy did not follow them far, but drew back, the Athenians likewise returned;


8.10.2
5431
τὰς γὰρ τῶν Χίων ἑπτὰ ναῦς ἐν τῷ ἀριθμῷ μετὰ σφῶν ἔχοντες οὐ πιστὰς ἐνόμιζον , ἀλλ’ ὕστερον ἄλλας προσπληρώσαντες ἐς ἑπτὰ καὶ τριάκοντα παραπλέοντας αὐτοὺς καταδιώκουσιν ἐς Σπείραιον τῆς Κορινθίας ·
for they had the seven Chian vessels in the number of those with them, and did not consider them trustworthy.


8.10.3
5432
ἔστι δὲ λιμὴν ἐρῆμος καὶ ἔσχατος πρὸς τὰ μεθόρια τῆς Ἐπιδαυρίας .
Afterwards, having manned others, so as to make in all thirty-seven, while the enemy were coasting along, they chased them into Piraeus, in the Corinthian territory.


8.10.3
5433
καὶ μίαν μὲν ναῦν ἀπολλύασι μετέωρον οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι , τὰς δὲ ἄλλας ξυναγαγόντες ὁρμίζουσιν .
This is a desert port, on the extreme borders of Epidaurus. The Peloponnesians lost one ship out at sea, but collected the rest, and brought them to anchor.


8.10.4
5434
καὶ προσβαλόντων τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν ταῖς ναυσὶ καὶ ἐς τὴν γῆν ἀποβάντων θόρυβός τε ἐγένετο πολὺς καὶ ἄτακτος , καὶ τῶν τε νεῶν τὰς πλείους κατατραυματίζουσιν ἐν τῇ γῇ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ τὸν ἄρχοντα Ἀλκαμένη ἀποκτείνουσιν ·
And now, when the Athenians both attacked them by sea with their ships, and had landed on the shore, there was a great disorder and confusion;


8.10.4
5435
καὶ αὐτῶν τινὲς ἀπέθανον .
and the Athenians severely damaged most of their ships on the beach, and killed Alcamenes their commander; whilst some also fell on their own side.


8.11.1
5436
διακριθέντες δὲ πρὸς μὲν τὰς πολεμίας ναῦς ἐπέταξαν ἐφορμεῖν ἱκανάς , ταῖς δὲ λοιπαῖς ἐς τὸ νησίδιον ὁρμίζονται ἐν ᾧ οὐ πολὺ ἀπέχοντι ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο , καὶ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἐπὶ βοήθειαν ἔπεμπον .
After parting, they posted a sufficient number of ships to keep watch over those of the enemy, and with the rest came to anchor at the small island[opposite the mouth of the harbour]; on which, as it was not far off, they proceeded to encamp, and sent to Athens for a reinforcement.


8.11.2
5437
παρῆσαν γὰρ καὶ τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ οἵ τε Κορίνθιοι βοηθοῦντες ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς καὶ οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι πρόσχωροι .
For the Corinthians, too, had joined the Peloponnesians on the day after the battle, coming to the succour of the ships; and not long after, the rest of the people in the neighbourhood also.


8.11.2
5438
καὶ ὁρῶντες τὴν φυλακὴν ἐν χωρίῳ ἐρήμῳ ἐπίπονον οὖσαν ἠπόρουν , καὶ ἐπενόησαν μὲν κατακαῦσαι τὰς ναῦς , ἔπειτα δὲ ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς ἀνελκύσαι καὶ τῷ πεζῷ προσκαθημένους φυλακὴν ἔχειν , ἕως ἄν τις παρατύχῃ διαφυγὴ ἐπιτηδεία .
But when they saw that to keep guard over them in so desert a spot was a difficult service, they were at a loss what to do, and thought of burning the ships; but afterwards they determined to draw them up on shore, and station themselves by them with their land forces, and keep guard until some favourable opportunity of escape presented itself.


8.11.2
5439
ἔπεμψε δ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ Ἆγις αἰσθόμενος ταῦτα ἄνδρα Σπαρτιάτην Θέρμωνα .
Agis also, on receiving intelligence of this, sent to them a Spartan, namely Thermon.


8.11.3
5440
τοῖς δὲ Λακεδαιμονίοις πρῶτον μὲν ἠγγέλθη ὅτι αἱ νῆες ἀνηγμέναι εἰσὶν ἐκ τοῦ Ἰσθμοῦ ( εἴρητο γάρ , ὅταν γένηται τοῦτο , Ἀλκαμένει ὑπὸ τῶν ἐφόρων ἱππέα πέμψαι ) , καὶ εὐθὺς τὰς παρὰ σφῶν πέντε ναῦς καὶ Χαλκιδέα ἄρχοντα καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδην μετ’ αὐτοῦ ἐβούλοντο πέμπειν ·
Now news had first been taken to the Lacedaemonians that their ships had put to sea from the isthmus, (for Alcamenes had been told by the ephors to send a horseman when that took place,)


8.11.3
5441
ἔπειτα ὡρμημένων αὐτῶν τὰ περὶ τὴν ἐν τῷ Σπειραίῳ τῶν νεῶν καταφυγὴν ἠγγέλθη , καὶ ἀθυμήσαντες , ὅτι πρῶτον ἁπτόμενοι τοῦ Ἰωνικοῦ πολέμου ἔπταισαν , τὰς ναῦς τὰς ἐκ τῆς ἑαυτῶν οὐκέτι διενοοῦντο πέμπειν , ἀλλὰ καί τινας προανηγμένας μετακαλεῖν .
and they immediately wished to despatch their five ships, with Chalcideus in command, and Alcibiades with him. Afterwards, when they had resolved on this, the news of their fleet taking refuge in Piraeus reached them; and being disheartened, because they had failed in their first operations in the Ionian war, they no longer thought of sending the ships from their own country, but even of recalling some that had previously put out to sea.


8.12.1
5442
γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης πείθει αὖθις Ἔνδιον καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἐφόρους μὴ ἀποκνῆσαι τὸν πλοῦν , λέγων ὅτι φθήσονταί τε πλεύσαντες πρὶν τὴν τῶν νεῶν ξυμφορὰν Χίους αἰσθέσθαι , καὶ αὐτὸς ὅταν προσβάλῃ Ἰωνίᾳ , ῥᾳδίως πείσειν τὰς πόλεις ἀφίστασθαι τήν τε τῶν Ἀθηναίων λέγων ἀσθένειαν καὶ τὴν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων προθυμίαν ·
When Alcibiades knew this, he again persuaded Endius and the rest of the ephors not to shrink from the expedition; telling them that they would have made their voyage before the Chians heard of the disaster which had befallen their fleet;


8.12.1
5443
πιστότερος γὰρ ἄλλων φανεῖσθαι .
and that he himself, when he had once reached Ionia, would easily persuade the cities to revolt, by acquainting them both with the weakness of the Athenians and the forwardness of the Lacedaemonians; for he should be thought more credible than others.


8.12.2
5444
Ἐνδίῳ τε αὐτῷ ἰδίᾳ ἔλεγε καλὸν εἶναι δι’ ἐκείνου ἀποστῆσαί τε Ἰωνίαν καὶ βασιλέα ξύμμαχον ποιῆσαι Λακεδαιμονίοις , καὶ μὴ Ἄγιδος τὸ ἀγώνισμα τοῦτο γενέσθαι ·
To Endius himself he also represented in private, that it would be a glorious thing to have caused by his own agency the revolt of Ionia, and to have brought the king into alliance with the Lacedaemonians, instead of that honour being earned by Agis;


8.12.2
5445
ἐτύγχανε γὰρ τῷ Ἄγιδι αὐτὸς διάφορος ὤν .
(for with him he happened to be at variance.)


8.12.3
5446
καὶ ὁ μὲν πείσας τούς τε ἄλλους ἐφόρους καὶ Ἔνδιον ἀνήγετο ταῖς πέντε ναυσὶ μετὰ Χαλκιδέως τοῦ Λακεδαιμονίου , καὶ διὰ τάχους τὸν πλοῦν ἐποιοῦντο .
He, then, having prevailed on the rest of the ephors, as well as Endius, put out to sea with the five ships, in company with Chalcideus the Lacedaemonian, and they proceeded on their voyage with all speed.


8.13.1
5447
ἀνεκομίζοντο δὲ ὑπὸ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον τοῦτον καὶ αἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Σικελίας Πελοποννησίων ἑκκαίδεκα νῆες αἱ μετὰ Γυλίππου ξυνδιαπολεμήσασαι ·
About this same time also, the sixteen Peloponnesian vessels in Sicily which with Gylippus had assisted in bringing the war to a conclusion, were on their return;


8.13.1
5448
καὶ περὶ τὴν Λευκάδα ἀποληφθεῖσαι καὶ κοπεῖσαι ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀττικῶν ἑπτὰ καὶ εἴκοσι νεῶν , ὧν ἦρχεν Ἱπποκλῆς Μενίππου φυλακὴν ἔχων τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς Σικελίας νεῶν , αἱ λοιπαὶ πλὴν μιᾶς διαφυγοῦσαι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους κατέπλευσαν ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον .
and after being intercepted near Leucadia, and roughly handled by the seven and twenty Athenian ships which Hippocles son of Menippus commanded, on the look-out for the ships from Sicily, the rest of them, with the exception of one, escaped from the Athenians, and sailed into harbour at Corinth.


8.14.1
5449
ὁ δὲ Χαλκιδεὺς καὶ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης πλέοντες ὅσοις τε ἐπιτύχοιεν ξυνελάμβανον τοῦ μὴ ἐξάγγελτοι γενέσθαι , καὶ προσβαλόντες πρῶτον Κωρύκῳ τῆς ἠπείρου καὶ ἀφέντες ἐνταῦθα αὐτοὺς αὐτοὶ μὲν προξυγγενόμενοι τῶν ξυμπρασσόντων Χίων τισὶ καὶ κελευόντων καταπλεῖν μὴ προειπόντας ἐς τὴν πόλιν , ἀφικνοῦνται αἰφνίδιοι τοῖς Χίοις .
With regard to Chalcideus and Alcibiades, while they were on their voyage, they seized all they met with, to prevent any tidings of their approach being carried; and after first touching at Corycus, and leaving them there, they themselves having previously had an interview with some of the Chians who were in co-operation with them, and being urged by them to sail up to the city without sending any notice beforehand, they thus came upon the Chians unexpectedly.


8.14.2
5450
καὶ οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ ἐν θαύματι ἦσαν καὶ ἐκπλήξει ·
Accordingly the greater part of them were astonished and dismayed;


8.14.2
5451
τοῖς δ’ ὀλίγοις παρεσκεύαστο ὥστε βουλήν τε τυχεῖν ξυλλεγομένην , καὶ γενομένων λόγων ἀπό τε τοῦ Χαλκιδέως καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδου ὡς ἄλλαι τε νῆες πολλαὶ προσπλέουσι καὶ τὰ περὶ τῆς πολιορκίας τῶν ἐν τῷ Σπειραίῳ νεῶν οὐ δηλωσάντων , ἀφίστανται Χῖοι καὶ αὖθις Ἐρυθραῖοι Ἀθηναίων .
while it had been arranged by the few, that the council should be assembled just at the time. And when speeches were made by Chalcideus and Alcibiades, telling them that many more vessels were sailing up, and not acquainting them with the fact respecting their fleet being blockaded in Piraeus, the Chians revolted from the Athenians, and immediately after them the Erythraeans.


8.14.3
5452
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα τρισὶ ναυσὶ πλεύσαντες καὶ Κλαζομενὰς ἀφιστᾶσιν .
After this they sailed with three vessels and induced Clazomenae to revolt also.


8.14.3
5453
διαβάντες τε εὐθὺς οἱ Κλαζομένιοι ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον τὴν Πολίχναν ἐτείχιζον , εἴ τι δέοι , σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῆς νησῖδος ἐν ᾗ οἰκοῦσι πρὸς ἀναχώρησιν .
The Clazomenians immediately crossed over to the continent, and began to fortify Polichna, in case they might want it as a place to retreat to from the island on which they lived.


8.14.3
5454
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀφεστῶτες ἐν τειχισμῷ τε πάντες ἦσαν καὶ παρασκευῇ πολέμου ·
They, then, having revolted, were all engaged in raising fortifications and preparing for the war.


8.15.1
5455
ἐς δὲ τὰς Ἀθήνας ταχὺ ἀγγελία τῆς Χίου ἀφικνεῖται ·
News of the revolt of Chios quickly reached Athens,


8.15.1
5456
καὶ νομίσαντες μέγαν ἤδη καὶ σαφῆ τὸν κίνδυνον σφᾶς περιεστάναι , καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς ξυμμάχους οὐκ ἐθελήσειν τῆς μεγίστης πόλεως μεθεστηκυίας ἡσυχάζειν , τά τε χίλια τάλαντα , ὧν διὰ παντὸς τοῦ πολέμου ἐγλίχοντο μὴ ἅψασθαι , εὐθὺς ἔλυσαν τὰς ἐπικειμένας ζημίας τῷ εἰπόντι ἢ ἐπιψηφίσαντι ὑπὸ τῆς παρούσης ἐκπλήξεως , καὶ ἐψηφίσαντο κινεῖν καὶ ναῦς πληροῦν οὐκ ὀλίγας , τῶν τε ἐν τῷ Σπειραίῳ ἐφορμουσῶν τὰς μὲν ὀκτὼ ἤδη πέμπειν , αἳ ἀπολιποῦσαι τὴν φυλακὴν τὰς μετὰ Χαλκιδέως διώξασαι καὶ οὐ καταλαβοῦσαι ἀνεκεχωρήκεσαν ( ἦρχε δὲ αὐτῶν Στρομβιχίδης Διοτίμου ) , ἄλλας δὲ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον βοηθεῖν δώδεκα μετὰ Θρασυκλέους , ἀπολιπούσας καὶ ταύτας τὴν ἐφόρμησιν .
and considering that the danger which had now encompassed them was great and evident, and that the rest of the allies would not remain quiet when the most important state had changed sides; with regard to the thousand talents which throughout the whole war they had earnestly desired not to meddle with, they immediately rescinded, in consequence of their dismay, the penalties attaching to any one who proposed to use them, or put such a proposal to the vote; and passed a decree for taking them, and manning a large number of ships; while of those that were keeping watch at Piraeus they at once sent off the eight which had left the blockade, and after pursuing those with Chalcideus and not overtaking them, had returned, (their commander was Strombichides son of Diotimus,) and resolved that twelve more, under Thrasycles, should also leave the post of observation, and reinforce them shortly afterwards.


8.15.2
5457
τάς τε τῶν Χίων ἑπτὰ ναῦς , αἳ αὐτοῖς ξυνεπολιόρκουν τὰς ἐν τῷ Σπειραίῳ , ἀπαγαγόντες τοὺς μὲν δούλους ἐξ αὐτῶν ἠλευθέρωσαν , τοὺς δ’ ἐλευθέρους κατέδησαν .
They also removed the seven Chian vessels, which joined them in the blockade of Piraeus;


8.15.2
5458
ἑτέρας δὲ δέκα ἀντὶ πασῶν τῶν ἀπελθουσῶν νεῶν ἐς τὴν ἐφόρμησιν τῶν Πελοποννησίων διὰ τάχους πληρώσαντες ἀντέπεμψαν καὶ ἄλλας διενοοῦντο τριάκοντα πληροῦν .
and liberated the slaves who were on board of them, while the freemen they put in bonds. In the place of all the ships that had departed they speedily manned others, and sent them to observe the Peloponnesians, resolving at the same time to man thirty more.


8.15.2
5459
καὶ πολλὴ ἦν ἡ προθυμία καὶ ὀλίγον ἐπράσσετο οὐδὲν ἐς τὴν βοήθειαν τὴν ἐπὶ τὴν Χίον .
So great was their ardour; and no trivial measure was undertaken with regard to the forces they sent to Chios.


8.16.1
5460
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ Στρομβιχίδης ταῖς ὀκτὼ ναυσὶν ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Σάμον , καὶ προσλαβὼν Σαμίαν μίαν ἔπλευσεν ἐς Τέων καὶ ἡσυχάζειν ἠξίου αὐτούς .
In the mean time Strombichides with his eight ships arrived at Samos, and having added one Samian vessel to his squadron, he sailed to Teos, and begged them to remain quiet.


8.16.1
5461
ἐκ δὲ τῆς Χίου ἐς τὴν Τέων καὶ ὁ Χαλκιδεὺς μετὰ τριῶν καὶ εἴκοσι νεῶν ἐπέπλει καὶ ὁ πεζὸς ἅμα ὁ τῶν Κλαζομενίων καὶ Ἐρυθραίων παρῄει .
Chalcideus also was advancing with three and twenty ships from Chios to Teos; while at the same time the land forces of the Clazomenians and Erythraeans moved along the shore.


8.16.2
5462
προαισθόμενος δὲ ὁ Στρομβιχίδης ἐξανήγετο καὶ μετεωρισθεὶς ἐν τῷ πελάγει ὡς ἑώρα τὰς ναῦς πολλὰς τὰς ἀπὸ τῆς Χίου , φυγὴν ἐποιεῖτο ἐπὶ τῆς Σάμου ·
Strombichides, on receiving prior intelligence of this, weighed anchor beforehand; but when out in the open sea, on observing that the ships coming from Chios were so numerous, he fled towards Samos,


8.16.2
5463
αἱ δὲ ἐδίωκον .
while they pursued him.


8.16.3
5464
τὸν δὲ πεζὸν οἱ Τήιοι τὸ πρῶτον οὐκ ἐσδεχόμενοι , ὡς ἔφυγον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι , ἐσηγάγοντο .
With regard to the land forces, although the Teians were not at first disposed to admit them, yet when the Athenians had fled, they received them into the city.


8.16.3
5465
καὶ ἐπέσχον μὲν οἱ πεζοὶ καὶ Χαλκιδέα ἐκ τῆς διώξεως περιμένοντες ·
The troops then waited for some time, expecting Chalcideus also to return from the pursuit;


8.16.3
5466
ὡς δὲ ἐχρόνιζε , καθῄρουν αὐτοί τε τὸ τεῖχος ὃ ἀνῳκοδόμησαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τῆς Τηίων πόλεως τὸ πρὸς ἤπειρον , ξυγκαθῄρουν δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων ἐπελθόντες οὐ πολλοί , ὧν ἦρχε Στάγης ὕπαρχος Τισσαφέρνους .
but when he was long in coming, they began themselves to demolish the fort which the Athenians had built on the land side of the city of the Teians; while a small body of the barbarians also, who had joined them under the command of Stages, lieutenant of Tissaphernes, assisted them in the demolition of it.


8.17.1
5467
Χαλκιδεὺς δὲ καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδης ὡς κατεδίωξαν ἐς Σάμον Στρομβιχίδην , ἐκ μὲν τῶν ἐκ Πελοποννήσου νεῶν τοὺς ναύτας ὁπλίσαντες ἐν Χίῳ καταλιμπάνουσιν , ἀντιπληρώσαντες δὲ ταύτας τε ἐκ Χίου καὶ ἄλλας εἴκοσιν ἔπλεον ἐς Μίλητον ὡς ἀποστήσοντες ·
Chalcideus and Alcibiades, after chasing Strombichides into Samos, armed the seamen on board the vessels from the Peloponnese, and left them at Chios; and having manned these with substitutes from Chios, and twenty besides, they sailed to Miletus to effect its revolt.


8.17.2
5468
ἐβούλετο γὰρ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης , ὢν ἐπιτήδειος τοῖς προεστῶσι τῶν Μιλησίων , φθάσαι τάς τε ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ναῦς προσαγαγόμενος αὐτοὺς καὶ τοῖς Χίοις καὶ ἑαυτῷ καὶ Χαλκιδεῖ καὶ τῷ ἀποστείλαντι Ἐνδίῳ , ὥσπερ ὑπέσχετο , τὸ ἀγώνισμα προσθεῖναι , ὅτι πλείστας τῶν πόλεων μετὰ τῆς Χίων δυνάμεως καὶ Χαλκιδέως ἀποστήσας .
For Alcibiades, being on intimate terms with the leading men of the Milesians, wished to anticipate the ships from the Peloponnese by winning them over, and so to secure that honour, as he had promised, to the Chians, himself, Chalcideus, and Endius who had sent them out, by causing the revolt of as many cities as possible in concert with the Chian forces and Chalcideus.


8.17.3
5469
λαθόντες οὖν τὸ πλεῖστον τοῦ πλοῦ καὶ φθάσαντες οὐ πολὺ τόν τε Στρομβιχίδην καὶ τὸν Θρασυκλέα , ὃς ἔτυχεν ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν δώδεκα ναυσὶν ἄρτι παρὼν καὶ ξυνδιώκων , ἀφιστᾶσι τὴν Μίλητον .
Having made therefore the chief part of their passage unobserved, and having arrived a little before Strombichides and Thrasycles, who had just come from Athens with twelve ships, and joined in the pursuit of them, they prevailed on Miletus to revolt.


8.17.3
5470
καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι κατὰ πόδας μιᾶς δεούσαις εἴκοσι ναυσὶν ἐπιπλεύσαντες , ὡς αὐτοὺς οὐκ ἐδέχοντο οἱ Μιλήσιοι , ἐν Λάδῃ τῇ ἐπικειμένῃ νήσῳ ἐφώρμουν .
The Athenians sailed up close after them with nineteen ships, and on the Milesians not admitting them, came to anchor at the adjacent island of Lade.


8.17.4
5471
καὶ ἡ πρὸς βασιλέα ξυμμαχία Λακεδαιμονίοις ἡ πρώτη Μιλησίων εὐθὺς ἀποστάντων διὰ Τισσαφέρνους καὶ Χαλκιδέως ἐγένετο ἥδε .
And now the first alliance made between the king and the Lacedaemonians was concluded by Tissaphernes and Chalcideus, immediately after the revolt of the Milesians, to the following effect:


8.18.1
5472
&quot; ἐπὶ τοῖσδε ξυμμαχίαν ἐποιήσαντο πρὸς βασιλέα καὶ Τισσαφέρνην Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι .
"The following are the terms on which the Lacedaemonians and their confederates concluded an alliance with the king and Tissaphernes.


8.18.1
5473
ὁπόσην χώραν καὶ πόλεις βασιλεὺς ἔχει καὶ οἱ πατέρες οἱ βασιλέως εἶχον , βασιλέως ἔστω ·
All the country and cities which the king holds, or the forefathers of the king held, shall belong to the king:


8.18.1
5474
καὶ ἐκ τούτων τῶν πόλεων ὁπόσα Ἀθηναίοις ἐφοίτα χρήματα ἢ ἄλλο τι , κωλυόντων κοινῇ βασιλεὺς καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ὅπως μήτε χρήματα λαμβάνωσιν Ἀθηναῖοι μήτε ἄλλο μηδέν .
and from these cities whatever money, or any thing else, came in to the Athenians, shall be stopped by the king, the Lacedaemonians and their confederates, in common; so that the Athenians may receive neither money nor any thing else."


8.18.2
5475
καὶ τὸν πόλεμον τὸν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους κοινῇ πολεμούντων βασιλεὺς καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ·
"—Moreover, the war with the Athenians shall be carried on in common by the king, the Lacedaemonians, and their confederates;


8.18.2
5476
καὶ κατάλυσιν τοῦ πολέμου πρὸς Ἀθηναίους μὴ ἐξέστω ποιεῖσθαι , ἢν μὴ ἀμφοτέροις δοκῇ , βασιλεῖ καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις .
and it shall not be lawful to bring the war with the Athenians to a conclusion, except both parties shall agree to it, the king, and the Lacedaemonians with their confederates."


8.18.3
5477
ἢν δέ τινες ἀφιστῶνται ἀπὸ βασιλέως , πολέμιοι ὄντων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις ·
"—Should any revolt from the king, they shall be considered as enemies to the Lacedaemonians and their confederates;


8.18.3
5478
καὶ ἤν τινες ἀφιστῶνται ἀπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων , πολέμιοι ὄντων βασιλεῖ κατὰ τ- αὐτά &quot; .
and if any revolt from the Lacedaemonians and their confederates, they shall be considered as enemies to the king, in like manner."


8.19.1
5479
ἡ μὲν ξυμμαχία αὕτη ἐγένετο ·
This, then, was the alliance that was concluded;


8.19.1
5480
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα οἱ Χῖοι εὐθὺς δέκα ἑτέρας πληρώσαντες ναῦς ἔπλευσαν ἐς Ἄναια , βουλόμενοι περί τε τῶν ἐν Μιλήτῳ πυθέσθαι καὶ τὰς πόλεις ἅμα ἀφιστάναι .
immediately after which the Chians manned ten more ships, and sailed to Anaea, wishing both to get intelligence of those in Miletus, and at the same time to urge the cities to revolt.


8.19.2
5481
καὶ ἐλθούσης παρὰ Χαλκιδέως ἀγγελίας αὐτοῖς ἀποπλεῖν πάλιν , καὶ ὅτι Ἀμόργης παρέσται κατὰ γῆν στρατιᾷ , ἔπλευσαν ἐς Διὸς ἱερόν ·
But a message having reached them from Chalcideus, that they were to sail back again, and that Amorges would be upon them with an army on shore, they sailed to the temple of Jupiter,


8.19.2
5482
καὶ καθορῶσιν ἑκκαίδεκα ναῦς , ἃς ὕστερον ἔτι Θρασυκλέους Διομέδων ἔχων ἀπ’ Ἀθηνῶν προσέπλει .
and then descried sixteen ships, with which Diomedon again, subsequently to the arrival of Thrasicles, was sailing up from Athens.


8.19.3
5483
καὶ ὡς εἶδον , ἔφευγον μιᾷ μὲν νηὶ ἐς Ἔφεσον , αἱ δὲ λοιπαὶ ἐπὶ τῆς Τέω .
On seeing them they fled with one ship to Ephesus, while the rest proceeded towards Teos.


8.19.3
5484
καὶ τέσσαρας μὲν κενὰς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι λαμβάνουσι τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐς τὴν γῆν φθασάντων ·
The Athenians, then, took four of their ships empty, the men having escaped to shore beforehand;


8.19.3
5485
αἱ δ’ ἄλλαι ἐς τὴν Τηίων πόλιν καταφεύγουσιν .
but the rest took refuge in the city of the Teians.


8.19.4
5486
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ τῆς Σάμου ἀπέπλευσαν , οἱ δὲ Χῖοι ταῖς λοιπαῖς ναυσὶν ἀναγαγόμενοι καὶ ὁ πεζὸς μετ’ αὐτῶν Λέβεδον ἀπέστησαν καὶ αὖθις Αἱράς .
And now the Athenians sailed away from Samos; while the Chians put out with their remaining vessels, and their land forces with them, and procured the revolt of Lebedos, and then again of Erae.


8.19.4
5487
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἕκαστοι ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀπεκομίσθησαν , καὶ ὁ πεζὸς καὶ αἱ νῆες .
After this they returned to their respective homes, both the land and the sea forces.


8.20.1
5488
ὑπὸ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους αἱ ἐν τῷ Σπειραίῳ εἴκοσι νῆες τῶν Πελοποννησίων , καταδιωχθεῖσαι τότε καὶ ἐφορμούμεναι ἴσῳ ἀριθμῷ ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων , ἐπέκπλουν ποιησάμεναι αἰφνίδιον καὶ κρατήσασαι ναυμαχίᾳ τέσσαράς τε ναῦς λαμβάνουσι τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ ἀποπλεύσασαι ἐς Κεγχρειὰς τὸν ἐς τὴν Χίον καὶ τὴν Ἰωνίαν πλοῦν αὖθις παρεσκευάζοντο .
About the same time, the twenty ships of the Peloponnesians that were in Piraeus, which had been chased to land at the time we last mentioned them, and were blockaded by the Athenians with an equal number, having made a sudden sally against the Athenian squadron, and defeated it in an engagement, took four of the ships, and after sailing back to Cenchrea, proceeded to prepare again for their voyage to Chios and Ionia.


8.20.1
5489
καὶ ναύαρχος αὐτοῖς ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος Ἀστύοχος ἐπῆλθεν , ᾧπερ ἐγίγνετο ἤδη πᾶσα ἡ ναυαρχία .
Astyochus also joined them from Lacedaemon, as high admiral, to whom now belonged the command of all the naval forces.


8.20.2
5490
ἀναχωρήσαντος δὲ τοῦ ἐκ τῆς Τέω πεζοῦ καὶ Τισσαφέρνης αὐτὸς στρατιᾷ παραγενόμενος καὶ ἐπικαθελὼν τὸ ἐν τῇ Τέῳ τεῖχος , εἴ τι ὑπελείφθη , ἀνεχώρησεν .
Meanwhile, after the troops had returned from Teos, Tissaphernes himself also repaired thither with an army, and further demolished the fort at Teos, whatever had been left of it, and then returned.


8.20.2
5491
καὶ Διομέδων ἀπελθόντος αὐτοῦ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον δέκα ναυσὶν Ἀθηναίων ἀφικόμενος ἐσπείσατο Τηίοις ὥστε δέχεσθαι καὶ σφᾶς .
Not long after his departure, Diomedon, having arrived with ten Athenian ships, concluded a treaty with the Teians for admitting his force, as they did the enemy's.


8.20.2
5492
καὶ παραπλεύσας ἐπὶ Αἱρὰς καὶ προσβαλών , ὡς οὐκ ἐλάμβανε τὴν πόλιν , ἀπέπλευσεν .
And after coasting along to Erae, and assaulting the city without taking it, he sailed away.


8.21.1
5493
ἐγένετο δὲ κατὰ τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον καὶ ἡ ἐν Σάμῳ ἐπανάστασις ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου τοῖς δυνατοῖς μετὰ Ἀθηναίων , οἳ ἔτυχον ἐν τρισὶ ναυσὶ παρόντες .
About the same time, too, occurred at Samos the insurrection of the commons against the nobles, in conjunction with some Athenians who happened to be there on board three vessels.


8.21.1
5494
καὶ ὁ δῆμος ὁ Σαμίων ἐς διακοσίους μέν τινας τοὺς πάντας τῶν δυνατωτάτων ἀπέκτεινε , τετρακοσίους δὲ φυγῇ ζημιώσαντες καὶ αὐτοὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν καὶ οἰκίας νειμάμενοι , Ἀθηναίων τε σφίσιν αὐτονομίαν μετὰ ταῦτα ὡς βεβαίοις ἤδη ψηφισαμένων , τὰ λοιπὰ διῴκουν τὴν πόλιν , καὶ τοῖς γεωμόροις μετεδίδοσαν οὔτε ἄλλου οὐδενὸς οὔτε ἐκδοῦναι οὐδ’ ἀγαγέσθαι παρ’ ἐκείνων οὐδ’ ἐς ἐκείνους οὐδενὶ ἔτι τοῦ δήμου ἐξῆν .
The popular party of the Samians, then, put to death some two hundred of the nobles, in all, and condemned four hundred to banishment; and having themselves taken possession of their land and houses, (the Athenians, moreover, having after this passed a decree for their independence, considering them now as trusty allies,) they governed the city henceforth, and neither admitted the landowners to any other privilege, nor allowed any of the commons in future to give his daughter in marriage to them, nor to take a wife from them.


8.22.1
5495
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους οἱ Χῖοι , ὥσπερ ἤρξαντο , οὐδὲν ἀπολείποντες προθυμίας , ἄνευ τε Πελοποννησίων πλήθει παρόντες ἀποστῆσαι τὰς πόλεις καὶ βουλόμενοι ἅμα ὡς πλείστους σφίσι ξυγκινδυνεύειν , στρατεύονται αὐτοί τε τρισκαίδεκα ναυσὶν ἐπὶ τὴν Λέσβον , ὥσπερ εἴρητο ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων δεύτερον ἐπ’ αὐτὴν ἰέναι καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον , καὶ ὁ πεζὸς ἅμα Πελοποννησίων τε τῶν παρόντων καὶ τῶν αὐτόθεν ξυμμάχων παρῄει ἐπὶ Κλαζομενῶν τε καὶ Κύμης ·
After these things, in the course of the same summer, the Chians went on as they had begun, without any falling off in their zeal; and as they found themselves, even independently of the Lacedaemonians, with a large force for bringing over the states, and at the same time were desirous that as many as possible should share the danger with them, they made an expedition by themselves with thirteen ships to Lesbos, according to the arrangement of the Lacedaemonians to go to that island in the second place, and thence to the Hellespont, while at the same time the land forces of the Peloponnesians who were there, and of the allies from the country itself, moved along shore towards Clazomenae and Cuma;


8.22.1
5496
ἦρχε δ’ αὐτοῦ Εὐάλας Σπαρτιάτης , τῶν δὲ νεῶν Δεινιάδας περίοικος .
the commander of the troops being Evalas, a Spartan, and of the ships, Diniadas, one of the Perioeci.


8.22.2
5497
καὶ αἱ μὲν νῆες καταπλεύσασαι Μήθυμναν πρῶτον ἀφιστᾶσι , καὶ καταλείπονται τέσσαρες νῆες ἐν αὐτῇ ·
The fleet having sailed first to Methymna, effected the revolt of the place, and four vessels were left there;


8.22.2
5498
καὶ αὖθις αἱ λοιπαὶ Μυτιλήνην ἀφιστᾶσιν .
while the remainder, again, effected that of Mytilene also.


8.23.1
5499
Ἀστύοχος δὲ ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος ναύαρχος τέσσαρσι ναυσίν , ὥσπερ ὥρμητο , πλέων ἐκ τῶν Κεγχρειῶν ἀφικνεῖται ἐς Χίον .
Now Astyochus, the Lacedaemonian admiral, set sail, as he had intended, with four ships from Cenchrea, and arrived at Chios.


8.23.1
5500
καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν αὐτοῦ ἥκοντος αἱ Ἀττικαὶ νῆες πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν ἔπλεον ἐς Λέσβον , ὧν ἦρχε Λέων καὶ Διομέδων ·
On the third day after his coming there, the Athenian ships, five and twenty in number, sailed to Lesbos under the command of Leon and Diomedon;


8.23.1
5501
Λέων γὰρ ὕστερον δέκα ναυσὶ προσεβοήθησεν ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν .
for Leon had subsequently brought a reinforcement of ten ships from Athens.


8.23.2
5502
ἀναγαγόμενος δὲ καὶ ὁ Ἀστύοχος τῇ αὐτῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐς ὀψὲ καὶ προσλαβὼν Χίαν ναῦν μίαν ἔπλει ἐς τὴν Λέσβον , ὅπως ὠφελοίη , εἴ τι δύναιτο .
The same day, at a late hour, Astyochus also put out, and taking one Chian vessel in addition to his own, sailed to Lesbos, to render it whatever assistance he could.


8.23.2
5503
καὶ ἀφικνεῖται ἐς τὴν Πύρραν , ἐκεῖθεν δὲ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ἐς Ἔρεσον , ἔνθα πυνθάνεται ὅτι ἡ Μυτιλήνη ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων αὐτοβοεὶ ἑάλωκεν ·
Accordingly he came to Pyrrha, and thence the next day to Eresus, where he heard that Mitylene had been taken by the Athenians on the first assault.


8.23.3
5504
οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι ὥσπερ ἔπλεον ἀπροσδόκητοι κατασχόντες ἐς τὸν λιμένα τῶν τε Χίων νεῶν ἐκράτησαν καὶ ἀποβάντες τοὺς ἀντιστάντας μάχῃ νικήσαντες τὴν πόλιν ἔσχον .
For the Athenians, immediately on sailing to the place, unexpectedly put into the harbour, and defeated the Chian ships; and having landed, and conquered in a battle those who opposed them, they took possession of the city.


8.23.4
5505
ἃ πυνθανόμενος ὁ Ἀστύοχος τῶν τε Ἐρεσίων καὶ τῶν ἐκ τῆς Μηθύμνης μετ’ Εὐβούλου Χίων νεῶν , αἳ τότε καταλειφθεῖσαι καὶ ὡς ἡ Μυτιλήνη ἑάλω φεύγουσαι περιέτυχον αὐτῷ τρεῖς ( μία γὰρ ἑάλω ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ) , οὐκέτι ἐπὶ τὴν Μυτιλήνην ὥρμησεν , ἀλλὰ τὴν Ἔρεσον ἀποστήσας καὶ ὁπλίσας , καὶ τοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ νεῶν ὁπλίτας πεζῇ παραπέμπει ἐπὶ τὴν Ἄντισσαν καὶ Μήθυμναν ἄρχοντα Ἐτεόνικον προστάξας ·
Receiving this intelligence, both from the Eresians and from the Chian ships coming from Methymna with Eubulus, three of which fell in with him, (for one had been taken by the Athenians,) after being left behind at the time, and so escaping when Mitylene was taken, Astyochus no longer advanced to Mitylene, but having persuaded Eresus to revolt, and supplied it with arms, he both sent the heavy-armed from on board his own ships to Antissa and Methymna, having appointed Eteonicus to the command,


8.23.4
5506
καὶ αὐτὸς ταῖς τε μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ ναυσὶ καὶ ταῖς τρισὶ ταῖς Χίαις παρέπλει , ἐλπίζων τοὺς Μηθυμναίους θαρσήσειν τε ἰδόντας σφᾶς καὶ ἐμμενεῖν τῇ ἀποστάσει .
and himself coasted along thither with his own ships and the three Chians; hoping that the Methymnaeans would be encouraged by the sight of them, and persevere in their revolt.


8.23.5
5507
ὡς δὲ αὐτῷ τὰ ἐν τῇ Λέσβῳ πάντα ἠναντιοῦτο , ἀπέπλευσε τὸν ἑαυτοῦ στρατὸν πεζὸν ἀναλαβὼν ἐς τὴν Χίον .
But when every thing at Lesbos went against him, he took his own force on board, and sailed back to Chios;


8.23.5
5508
ἀπεκομίσθη δὲ πάλιν κατὰ πόλεις καὶ ὁ τῶν ξυμμάχων πεζός , ὃς ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ἐμέλλησεν ἰέναι .
while the land forces also that had been disembarked from the vessels, and were to have proceeded to the Hellespont, returned again to their several cities.


8.23.5
5509
καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν Κεγχρειᾷ ξυμμαχίδων Πελοποννησίων νεῶν ἀφικνοῦνται αὐτοῖς ἓξ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐς τὴν Χίον .
After this, six of the allied ships from the Peloponnese that were at Cenchrea came to them at Chios.


8.23.6
5510
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι τά τ’ ἐν τῇ Λέσβῳ πάλιν κατεστήσαντο καὶ πλεύσαντες ἐξ αὐτῆς Κλαζομενίων τὴν ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ Πολίχναν τειχιζομένην ἑλόντες διεκόμισαν πάλιν αὐτοὺς ἐς τὴν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ πόλιν , πλὴν τῶν αἰτίων τῆς ἀποστάσεως ·
The Athenians, on the other hand, arranged matters again at Lesbos, and sailing thence, took Polichna, belonging to the Clazomenians, which was being fortified on the mainland, and carried them over again to their city on the island, excepting the authors of the revolt;


8.23.6
5511
οὗτοι δὲ ἐς Δαφνοῦντα ἀπῆλθον .
who had departed to Daphnus.


8.23.6
5512
καὶ αὖθις Κλαζομεναὶ προσεχώρησαν Ἀθηναίοις .
And thus Clazomenae came over again to the Athenians.


8.24.1
5513
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους οἵ τ’ ἐπὶ Μιλήτῳ Ἀθηναῖοι ταῖς εἴκοσι ναυσὶν ἐν τῇ Λάδῃ ἐφορμοῦντες ἀπόβασιν ποιησάμενοι ἐς Πάνορμον τῆς Μιλησίας Χαλκιδέα τε τὸν Λακεδαιμόνιον ἄρχοντα μετ’ ὀλίγων παραβοηθήσαντα ἀποκτείνουσι καὶ τροπαῖον τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ὕστερον διαπλεύσαντες ἔστησαν , ὃ οἱ Μιλήσιοι ὡς οὐ μετὰ κράτους τῆς γῆς σταθὲν ἀνεῖλον ·
The same summer the Athenians, who were with their twenty ships at Lade for the observation of Miletus, having made a descent at Panormus in the Milesian territory, slew Chalcideus, the Lacedaemonian commander, who had come against them with a few men, and sailing across three days after, erected a trophy; which, as it had been raised without their having command of the country, the Milesians threw down.


8.24.2
5514
καὶ Λέων καὶ Διομέδων ἔχοντες τὰς ἐκ Λέσβου Ἀθηναίων ναῦς , ἔκ τε Οἰνουσσῶν τῶν πρὸ Χίου νήσων καὶ ἐκ Σιδούσσης καὶ ἐκ Πτελεοῦ , ἃ ἐν τῇ Ἐρυθραίᾳ εἶχον τείχη , καὶ ἐκ τῆς Λέσβου ὁρμώμενοι τὸν πρὸς τοὺς Χίους πόλεμον ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν ἐποιοῦντο ·
And now Leon and Diomedon, with the Athenian ships from Lesbos, advancing from the Oenussae, the islands off Chios, and from Sidussa and Pteleum, fortresses which they held in the Erythraean country, as well as from Lesbos, carried on the war against the Chians from their ships.


8.24.2
5515
εἶχον δ’ ἐπιβάτας τῶν ὁπλιτῶν ἐκ καταλόγου ἀναγκαστούς .
They had as some of the heavy-armed from the muster-roll, who had been pressed into the service.


8.24.3
5516
καὶ ἔν τε Καρδαμύλῃ ἀποβάντες καὶ ἐν Βολίσκῳ τοὺς προσβοηθήσαντας τῶν Χίων μάχῃ νικήσαντες καὶ πολλοὺς διαφθείραντες ἀνάστατα ἐποίησαν τὰ ταύτῃ χωρία , καὶ ἐν Φάναις αὖθις ἄλλῃ μάχῃ ἐνίκησαν καὶ τρίτῃ ἐν Λευκωνίῳ .
Having landed at Cardamyle and Bolissus, after defeating in battle those of the Chians who had come out against them, and killing many of them, they desolated the places in that neighbourhood.


8.24.3
5517
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο οἱ μὲν Χῖοι ἤδη οὐκέτι ἐπεξῇσαν , οἱ δὲ τὴν χώραν καλῶς κατεσκευασμένην καὶ ἀπαθῆ οὖσαν ἀπὸ τῶν Μηδικῶν μέχρι τότε διεπόρθησαν .
They defeated them again in another battle at Phanae, and in a third at Leuconium, after which the Chians no longer went out to meet them; while they ravaged their country, which was finely stocked, and had continued unhurt from the Median wars down to that time.


8.24.4
5518
Χῖοι γὰρ μόνοι μετὰ Λακεδαιμονίους ὧν ἐγὼ ᾐσθόμην ηὐδαιμόνησάν τε ἅμα καὶ ἐσωφρόνησαν , καὶ ὅσῳ ἐπεδίδου ἡ πόλις αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον , τόσῳ δὲ καὶ ἐκοσμοῦντο ἐχυρώτερον .
For the Chians are the only people that I am acquainted with, after the Lacedaemonians, who were at once prosperous and prudent; and the more their city increased in greatness, the more secure were their arrangements.


8.24.5
5519
καὶ οὐδ’ αὐτὴν τὴν ἀπόστασιν , εἰ τοῦτο δοκοῦσι παρὰ τὸ ἀσφαλέστερον πρᾶξαι , πρότερον ἐτόλμησαν ποιήσασθαι ἢ μετὰ πολλῶν τε καὶ ἀγαθῶν ξυμμάχων ἔμελλον ξυγκινδυνεύσειν καὶ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ᾐσθάνοντο οὐδ’ αὐτοὺς ἀντιλέγοντας ἔτι μετὰ τὴν Σικελικὴν ξυμφορὰν ὡς οὐ πάνυ πονηρά σφῶν βεβαίως τὰ πράγματα εἴη ·
And even their present revolt, if any think that they executed this without regard for the safer course, they did not venture to make, before they were likely to run the risk in concert with many brave allies, and perceived that even the Athenians themselves no longer denied, after their disaster in Sicily, that without doubt their circumstances were utterly bad.


8.24.5
5520
εἰ δέ τι ἐν τοῖς ἀνθρωπείοις τοῦ βίου παραλόγοις ἐσφάλησαν , μετὰ πολλῶν οἷς τ- αὐτὰ ἔδοξε , τὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ταχὺ ξυναναιρεθήσεσθαι , τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ξυνέγνωσαν .
But if they were somewhat disappointed by the unexpected results that occur in the life of man, they found out their mistake in company with many others, who had in the same way imagined that the power of the Athenians would be quickly destroyed.


8.24.6
5521
εἰργομένοις οὖν αὐτοῖς τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ κατὰ γῆν πορθουμένοις ἐνεχείρησάν τινες πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ἀγαγεῖν τὴν πόλιν ·
When therefore they were excluded from the sea, and were being ravaged by land, a party of them endeavoured to bring over the city to the Athenians.


8.24.6
5522
οὓς αἰσθόμενοι οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτοὶ μὲν ἡσύχασαν , Ἀστύοχον δὲ ἐξ Ἐρυθρῶν τὸν ναύαρχον μετὰ τεσσάρων νεῶν , αἳ παρῆσαν αὐτῷ , κομίσαντες ἐσκόπουν ὅπως μετριώτατα ἢ ὁμήρων λήψει ἢ ἄλλῳ τῳ τρόπῳ καταπαύσουσι τὴν ἐπιβουλήν .
Though the magistrates detected them, they remained quiet themselves, and having brought Astyochus the admiral from Erythrae with four ships, which he had with him, considered how they might stop the conspiracy by the mildest measures, whether by taking hostages, or in any other way.


8.24.6
5523
καὶ οἱ μὲν ταῦτα ἔπρασσον .
They, then, were engaged with this business.


8.25.1
5524
ἐκ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν τοῦ αὐτοῦ θέρους τελευτῶντος χίλιοι ὁπλῖται Ἀθηναίων καὶ πεντακόσιοι καὶ χίλιοι Ἀργείων ( τοὺς γὰρ πεντακοσίους τῶν Ἀργείων ψιλοὺς ὄντας ὥπλισαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ) καὶ χίλιοι τῶν ξυμμάχων ναυσὶ δυοῖν δεούσαις πεντήκοντα , ὧν ἦσαν καὶ ὁπλιταγωγοί , Φρυνίχου καὶ Ὀνομακλέους καὶ Σκιρωνίδου στρατηγούντων κατέπλευσαν ἐς Σάμον , καὶ διαβάντες ἐς Μίλητον ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο .
At the close of the same summer, there sailed from Athens a thousand Athenian heavy-armed, fifteen hundred of the Argives, (for five hundred of the Argives who were lightarmed, were provided with full armour by the Athenians,) and a thousand of the allies, in forty-eight ships, some of which were transports, under the command of Phrynichus, Onomacles, and Scironides: these sailed into port at Samos, and after crossing over to Miletus, formed their camp there.


8.25.2
5525
Μιλήσιοι δὲ ἐξελθόντες αὐτοί τε , ὀκτακόσιοι ὁπλῖται , καὶ οἱ μετὰ Χαλκιδέως ἐλθόντες Πελοποννήσιοι καὶ Τισσαφέρνους τι ξενικὸν ἐπικουρικόν , καὶ αὐτὸς Τισσαφέρνης παρὼν καὶ ἡ ἵππος αὐτοῦ , ξυνέβαλον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις .
The Milesians marched out, themselves to the number of eight hundred heavy-armed, the Peloponnesians who had come with Chalcideus, and a body of foreign mercenaries with Tissaphernes himself, who was present with his cavalry, and gave battle to the Athenians and their allies.


8.25.3
5526
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀργεῖοι τῷ σφετέρῳ αὐτῶν κέρᾳ προεξᾴξαντες καὶ καταφρονήσαντες , ὡς ἐπ’ Ἴωνάς τε καὶ οὐ δεξομένους ἀτακτότερον χωροῦντες , νικῶνται ὑπὸ τῶν Μιλησίων καὶ διαφθείρονται αὐτῶν ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους τριακοσίων ἀνδρῶν ·
The Argives, advancing from the line with their own wing, and despising the enemy, while they pushed forward in some disorder, as against Ionians and men who would not receive their charge, were defeated by the Milesians, and not less than three hundred of them slain.


8.25.4
5527
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ τούς τε Πελοποννησίους πρώτους νικήσαντες καὶ τοὺς βαρβάρους καὶ τὸν ἄλλον ὄχλον ὠσάμενοι , τοῖς Μιλησίοις οὐ ξυμμείξαντες , ἀλλ’ ὑποχωρησάντων αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν Ἀργείων τροπῆς ἐς τὴν πόλιν ὡς ἑώρων τὸ ἄλλο σφῶν ἡσσώμενον , πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν πόλιν τῶν Μιλησίων κρατοῦντες ἤδη τὰ ὅπλα τίθενται .
But the Athenians defeated the Peloponnesians first, then beat back the barbarians and the rest of the multitude, and without engaging the Milesians, (for they retreated into their city after their rout of the Argives, on seeing the rest of their army worsted,) they pitched their camp, as being now victorious, close to the very city of Miletus.


8.25.5
5528
καὶ ξυνέβη ἐν τῇ μάχῃ ταύτῃ τοὺς Ἴωνας ἀμφοτέρωθεν τῶν Δωριῶν κρατῆσαι ·
And it so happened, that in this battle the Ionians on both sides were superior to the Dorians;


8.25.5
5529
τούς τε γὰρ κατὰ σφᾶς Πελοποννησίους οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐνίκων καὶ τοὺς Ἀργείους οἱ Μιλήσιοι .
for the Athenians conquered the Peloponnesians opposed to them, and the Milesians the Argives.


8.25.5
5530
στήσαντες δὲ τροπαῖον τὸν περιτειχισμὸν ἰσθμώδους ὄντος τοῦ χωρίου οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι παρεσκευάζοντο , νομίζοντες , εἰ προσαγάγοιντο Μίλητον , ῥᾳδίως ἂν σφίσι καὶ τ- ἄλλα προσχωρῆσαι .
After erecting a trophy, the Athenians prepared to invest the place, (which stood on an isthmus,) thinking that if they could win Miletus, the other towns would easily come over to them.


8.26.1
5531
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ περὶ δείλην ἤδη ὀψίαν ἀγγέλλεται αὐτοῖς τὰς ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου καὶ Σικελίας πέντε καὶ πεντήκοντα ναῦς ὅσον οὐ παρεῖναι .
In the mean time, when it was now about dusk in the evening, intelligence reached them that the five and fifty ships from the Peloponnese and from Sicily were all but there.


8.26.1
5532
τῶν τε γὰρ Σικελιωτῶν , Ἑρμοκράτους τοῦ Συρακοσίου μάλιστα ἐνάγοντος ξυνεπιλαβέσθαι καὶ τῆς ὑπολοίπου Ἀθηναίων καταλύσεως , εἴκοσι νῆες Συρακοσίων ἦλθον καὶ Σελινούντιαι δύο , αἵ τε ἐκ Πελοποννήσου , ἃς παρεσκευάζοντο , ἑτοῖμαι ἤδη οὖσαι ·
For from the Siceliots, who were chiefly urged by Hermocrates the Syracusan to take part in what remained for the destruction of the Athenians, there came twenty ships of the Syracusans, and two of the Selinuntines; and those from the Peloponnese, which they were preparing, [when we last mentioned them,] were now ready:


8.26.1
5533
καὶ Θηριμένει τῷ Λακεδαιμονίῳ ξυναμφότεραι ὡς Ἀστύοχον τὸν ναύαρχον προσταχθεῖσαι κομίσαι , κατέπλευσαν ἐς Λέρον πρῶτον τὴν πρὸ Μιλήτου νῆσον ·
and both squadrons being committed to Theramenes the Lacedaemonian to take to Astyochus the admiral, put in to Lerus first, the island before Miletus.


8.26.2
5534
ἔπειτα ἐκεῖθεν αἰσθόμενοι ἐπὶ Μιλήτῳ ὄντας Ἀθηναίους ἐς τὸν Ἰασικὸν κόλπον πρότερον πλεύσαντες ἐβούλοντο εἰδέναι τὰ περὶ τῆς Μιλήτου .
Then, on finding that the Athenians were at Miletus, they sailed thence into the Iasic gulf in the first place, wishing to know the state of affairs with regard to Miletus.


8.26.3
5535
ἐλθόντος δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἵππῳ ἐς Τειχιοῦσσαν τῆς Μιλησίας , οἷπερ τοῦ κόλπου πλεύσαντες ηὐλίσαντο , πυνθάνονται τὰ περὶ τῆς μάχης ( παρῆν γὰρ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης καὶ ξυνεμάχετο τοῖς Μιλησίοις καὶ Τισσαφέρνει ) , καὶ αὐτοῖς παρῄνει , εἰ μὴ βούλονται τά τε ἐν Ἰωνίᾳ καὶ τὰ ξύμπαντα πράγματα διολέσαι , ὡς τάχιστα βοηθεῖν Μιλήτῳ καὶ μὴ περιιδεῖν ἀποτειχισθεῖσαν .
When Alcibiades therefore had gone on horseback to Tichiussa, in the Milesian territory, to which part of the gulf they had sailed and brought to for the night, they heard the particulars of the battle. For Alcibiades was present at it, taking part with the Milesians and Tissaphernes; and he now advised them, if they did not wish to sacrifice Ionia and the whole cause, to go as quickly as possible to the relief of Miletus, and not permit it to be invested.


8.27.1
5536
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ ἔμελλον βοηθήσειν ·
They, then, intended to relieve it in the morning.


8.27.1
5537
Φρύνιχος δὲ ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγός , ὡς ἀπὸ τῆς Λέρου ἐπύθετο τὰ τῶν νεῶν σαφῶς , βουλομένων τῶν ξυναρχόντων ὑπομείναντας διαναυμαχεῖν , οὐκ ἔφη οὔτ’ αὐτὸς ποιήσειν τοῦτο οὔτ’ ἐκείνοις οὐδ’ ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἐς δύναμιν ἐπιτρέψειν .
Phrynichus, the commander of the Athenians, on the other hand, when he had heard from Lerus a correct account of their fleet, and when his colleagues wished to await its arrival and give it battle, said that he would neither do so himself, nor, to the best of his power, allow them or any one else to do it.


8.27.2
5538
ὅπου γὰρ ἔξεστιν ἐν ὑστέρῳ σαφῶς εἰδότας πρὸς ὁπόσας τε ναῦς πολεμίας καὶ ὅσαις πρὸς αὐτὰς ταῖς σφετέραις ἱκανῶς καὶ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν παρασκευασαμένοις ἔσται ἀγωνίσασθαι , οὐδέποτε τῷ αἰσχρῷ ὀνείδει εἴξας ἀλόγως διακινδυνεύσειν .
For when they might meet them hereafter with an accurate knowledge of the number of ships on the enemy's side, and with how many of their own opposed to them they would, after adequate and calm preparations, be able to give them battle, he would never run an unreasonable hazard through yielding to the disgrace of reproach.


8.27.3
5539
οὐ γὰρ αἰσχρὸν εἶναι Ἀθηναίους ναυτικῷ μετὰ καιροῦ ὑποχωρῆσαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ μετὰ ὁτουοῦν τρόπου αἴσχιον ξυμβήσεσθαι ἢν ἡσσηθῶσιν ·
For it was no disgrace for the Athenians to retreat with a navy at a proper time; but in any way whatever, the result would be more disgraceful should they be defeated, and for the state to incur not only disgrace, but also the greatest danger.


8.27.3
5540
καὶ τὴν πόλιν οὐ μόνον τῷ αἰσχρῷ , ἀλλὰ καὶ τῷ μεγίστῳ κινδύνῳ περιπίπτειν , ᾗ μόλις ἐπὶ ταῖς γεγενημέναις ξυμφοραῖς ἐνδέχεσθαι μετὰ βεβαίου παρασκευῆς καθ’ ἑκουσίαν , ἢ πάνυ γε ἀνάγκῃ , προτέρᾳ ποι ἐπιχειρεῖν , ἦ που δὴ μὴ βιαζομένῃ γε πρὸς αὐθαιρέτους κινδύνους ἰέναι .
For after its late misfortunes, it was hardly expedient voluntarily for it to act on the offensive in any quarter, even with a force that could be relied upon, or even in a case of absolute necessity:


8.27.4
5541
ὡς τάχιστα δὲ ἐκέλευε τούς τε τραυματίας ἀναλαβόντας καὶ τὸν πεζὸν καὶ τῶν σκευῶν ὅσα ἦλθον ἔχοντες , ἃ δ’ ἐκ τῆς πολεμίας εἰλήφασι καταλιπόντας ὅπως κοῦφαι ὦσιν αἱ νῆες , ἀποπλεῖν ἐς Σάμον , κ- ἐκεῖθεν ἤδη ξυναγαγόντας πάσας τὰς ναῦς τοὺς ἐπίπλους , ἤν που καιρὸς ᾖ , ποιεῖσθαι .
how then could it without any such compulsion rush into self-chosen dangers? He ordered them therefore as quickly as possible to take up their wounded, and their land forces, with such stores as they had brought with them; but to leave behind what they had taken from the enemy's country, that their ships might be the lighter, and to sail away to Samos, and thence, when they had Collected all their ships, to make their attacks upon them, whenever they had an opportunity.


8.27.5
5542
ὡς δὲ ἔπεισε , καὶ ἔδρασε ταῦτα ·
Having given this advice, he acted accordingly;


8.27.5
5543
καὶ ἔδοξεν οὐκ ἐν τῷ αὐτίκα μᾶλλον ἢ ὕστερον , οὐκ ἐς τοῦτο μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐς ὅσα ἄλλα Φρύνιχος κατέστη , οὐκ ἀξύνετος εἶναι .
and so Phrynichus, not on that immediate occasion more than on subsequent ones, nor in that business only, but in all that he had any thing to do with. proved himself to be a man of sound judgment.


8.27.6
5544
καὶ οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι ἀφ’ ἑσπέρας εὐθὺς τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἀτελεῖ τῇ νίκῃ ἀπὸ τῆς Μιλήτου ἀνέστησαν , καὶ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι κατὰ τάχος καὶ πρὸς ὀργὴν τῆς ξυμφορᾶς ἀπέπλευσαν ἐκ τῆς Σάμου ἐπ’ οἴκου ·
In this way, with an incomplete victory, the Athenians immediately broke up their camp, and retired from Miletus; and the Argives, in mortification at their defeat, sailed off home from Samos as quickly as they could.


8.28.1
5545
οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ ἐκ τῆς Τειχιούσσης ἄραντες ἐπικατάγονται , καὶ μείναντες ἡμέραν μίαν τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ καὶ τὰς Χίας ναῦς προσλαβόντες τὰς μετὰ Χαλκιδέως τὸ πρῶτον ξυγκαταδιωχθείσας ἐβούλοντο πλεῦσαι ἐπὶ τὰ σκεύη ἃ ἐξείλοντο ἐς Τειχιοῦσσαν πάλιν .
As soon as it was morning, the Peloponnesians weighed anchor from Tichiussa, and put into Miletus after the enemy's departure; and after remaining one day, they took with them on the next the Chian vessels which had, in the first instance been chased in company with Chalcideus, and were disposed to sail back again for the stores which they had taken out of their vessels at Tichiussa.


8.28.2
5546
καὶ ὡς ἦλθον , Τισσαφέρνης τῷ πεζῷ παρελθὼν πείθει αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ Ἴασον , ἐν ᾗ Ἀμόργης πολέμιος ὢν κατεῖχε , πλεῦσαι .
On their arrival, Tissaphernes came to them with his land forces, and persuaded them to sail against Iasus, in which Amorges their enemy maintained himself.


8.28.2
5547
καὶ προσβαλόντες τῇ Ἰάσῳ αἰφνίδιοι καὶ οὐ προσδεχομένων ἀλλ’ ἢ Ἀττικὰς τὰς ναῦς εἶναι αἱροῦσιν ·
Accordingly, having assaulted Iasus on a sudden, and while the inhabitants thought nothing but that the ships belonged to the Athenians, they took it;


8.28.2
5548
καὶ μάλιστα ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐπῃνέθησαν .
and the Syracusans were most distinguished in the action.


8.28.3
5549
καὶ τόν τε Ἀμόργην ζῶντα λαβόντες , Πισσούθνου νόθον υἱόν , ἀφεστῶτα δὲ βασιλέως , παραδιδόασιν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι Τισσαφέρνει ἀπαγαγεῖν , εἰ βούλεται , βασιλεῖ , ὥσπερ αὐτῷ προσέταξε , καὶ τὴν Ἴασον διεπόρθησαν καὶ χρήματα πάνυ πολλὰ ἡ στρατιὰ ἔλαβεν ·
Amorges, who was a natural son of Pissuthnes, and had revolted from the king, the Peloponnesians took prisoner, and delivered him up to Tissaphernes to lead away to the king, if he pleased, according to his orders.


8.28.3
5550
παλαιόπλουτον γὰρ ἦν τὸ χωρίον .
They then sacked Iasus; and the army got very large treasures, for the place was one of ancient wealth.


8.28.4
5551
τούς τ’ ἐπικούρους τοὺς περὶ τὸν Ἀμόργην παρὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς κομίσαντες καὶ οὐκ ἀδικήσαντες ξυνέταξαν , ὅτι ἦσαν οἱ πλεῖστοι ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ·
The mercenaries serving with Amorges they took to themselves, and added to their ranks, without doing them any harm, as most of them were from the Peloponnese:


8.28.4
5552
τό τε πόλισμα Τισσαφέρνει παραδόντες καὶ τὰ ἀνδράποδα πάντα καὶ δοῦλα καὶ ἐλεύθερα , ὧν καθ’ ἕκαστον στατῆρα Δαρεικὸν παρ’ αὐτοῦ ξυνέβησαν λαβεῖν , ἔπειτα ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν Μίλητον .
while they delivered to Tissaphernes the town and all the captives, both bond and free, for each one of whom they stipulated to receive from him a Daric stater; after which they returned to Miletus.


8.28.5
5553
καὶ Πεδάριτόν τε τὸν Λέοντος ἐς τὴν Χίον ἄρχοντα Λακεδαιμονίων πεμψάντων ἀποστέλλουσι πεζῇ μέχρι Ἐρυθρῶν ἔχοντα τὸ παρὰ Ἀμόργου ἐπικουρικόν , καὶ ἐς τὴν Μίλητον αὐτοῦ Φίλιππον καθιστᾶσιν .
Pedaritus the son of Leon, who had been sent by the Lacedaemonians to take the command at Chios, they despatched by land to Erythrae, with the mercenary force taken from Amorges,


8.28.5
5554
καὶ τὸ θέρος ἐτελεύτα .
and appointed Philippus to remain on the spot, as governor of Miletus. And so the summer ended.


8.29.1
5555
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου χειμῶνος , ἐπειδὴ τὴν Ἴασον κατεστήσατο ὁ Τισσαφέρνης ἐς φυλακήν , παρῆλθεν ἐς τὴν Μίλητον , καὶ μηνὸς μὲν τροφήν , ὥσπερ ὑπέστη ἐν τῇ Λακεδαίμονι , ἐς δραχμὴν Ἀττικὴν ἑκάστῳ πάσαις ταῖς ναυσὶ διέδωκε , τοῦ δὲ λοιποῦ χρόνου ἐβούλετο τριώβολον διδόναι , ἕως ἂν βασιλέα ἐπέρηται ·
The following winter, when Tissaphernes had put Iasus into a state of defence, he passed on to Miletus, and distributed amongst all the ships a month's pay, as he had undertaken at Lacedaemon, at the rate of an Attic drachma a man per day, but wished in future to give but three oboli, until he had consulted the king;


8.29.1
5556
ἢν δὲ κελεύῃ , δώσειν ἔφη ἐντελῆ τὴν δραχμήν .
should he, however, command it, he said he would give them the full drachma.


8.29.2
5557
Ἑρμοκράτους δὲ ἀντειπόντος τοῦ Συρακοσίου στρατηγοῦ ( ὁ γὰρ Θηριμένης οὐ ναύαρχος ὤν , ἀλλ’ Ἀστυόχῳ παραδοῦναι τὰς ναῦς ξυμπλέων μαλακὸς ἦν περὶ τοῦ μισθοῦ ) ὅμως δὲ παρὰ πέντε ναῦς πλέον ἀνδρὶ ἑκάστῳ ἢ τρεῖς ὀβολοὶ ὡμολογήθησαν .
When Hermocrates, the Syracusan commander, objected to this, (for Theramenes, inasmuch as he was not admiral, but only sailing with them to deliver up the fleet to Astyochus, was easy on the subject of pay,)


8.29.2
5558
ἐς γὰρ πέντε ναῦς καὶ πεντήκοντα τριάκοντα τάλαντα ἐδίδου τοῦ μηνός ·
there was fixed, notwithstanding, a sum [for the whole fleet] larger by five ships than three oboli a man per day. For he gave three talents a month for five ships,


8.29.2
5559
καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις , ὅσῳ πλείους νῆες ἦσαν τούτου τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ , κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον τοῦτον ἐδίδοτο .
and to the rest, according as they had vessels beyond this number, was given in the same proportion.


8.30.1
5560
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος τοῖς ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ Ἀθηναίοις προσαφιγμέναι γὰρ ἦσαν καὶ οἴκοθεν ἄλλαι νῆες πέντε καὶ τριάκοντα καὶ στρατηγοὶ Χαρμῖνος καὶ Στρομβιχίδης καὶ Εὐκτήμων , καὶ τὰς ἀπὸ Χίου καὶ τὰς ἄλλας πάσας ξυναγαγόντες ἐβούλοντο διακληρωσάμενοι ἐπὶ μὲν τῇ Μιλήτῳ τῷ ναυτικῷ ἐφορμεῖν , πρὸς δὲ τὴν Χίον καὶ ναυτικὸν καὶ πεζὸν πέμψαι .
The same winter, more ships, to the number of thirty-five, having come from home to join the Athenians at Samos, with Charminus, Strombichides, and Euctemon in command, after collecting those from Chios and all the rest, they determined, having drawn lots for their respective services, to blockade Miletus with their naval force, and to send against Chios both a fleet and army.


8.30.2
5561
καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως ·
And they did so.


8.30.2
5562
Στρομβιχίδης μὲν γὰρ καὶ Ὀνομακλῆς καὶ Εὐκτήμων τριάκοντα ναῦς ἔχοντες καὶ τῶν ἐς Μίλητον ἐλθόντων χιλίων ὁπλιτῶν μέρος ἄγοντες ἐν ναυσὶν ὁπλιταγωγοῖς ἐπὶ Χίον λαχόντες ἔπλεον , οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἐν Σάμῳ μένοντες τέσσαρσι καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα ναυσὶν ἐθαλασσοκράτουν καὶ ἐπίπλους τῇ Μιλήτῳ ἐποιοῦντο .
For Strombichides, Onomacles, and Euctemon, having with them thirty ships, and taking in transports a part of the thousand heavy-armed that had come to Miletus, sailed, according to their lot, against Chios, while the rest, remaining at Samos with seventy-four ships, secured the command of the sea, and advanced upon Miletus.


8.31.1
5563
ὁ δ’ Ἀστύοχος ὡς τότε ἐν τῇ Χίῳ ἔτυχε διὰ τὴν προδοσίαν τοὺς ὁμήρους καταλεγόμενος τούτου μὲν ἐπέσχεν ,ἐπειδὴ ᾔσθετο τάς τε μετὰ Θηριμένους ναῦς ἡκούσας καὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν ξυμμαχίαν βελτίω ὄντα , λαβὼν δὲ ναῦς τάς τε Πελοποννησίων δέκα καὶ Χίας δέκα ἀνάγεται , καὶ προσβαλὼν Πτελεῷ καὶ οὐχ ἑλὼν παρέπλευσεν ἐπὶ Κλαζομενὰς καὶ ἐκέλευεν αὐτῶν τοὺς τὰ Ἀθηναίων φρονοῦντας ἀνοικίζεσθαι ἐς τὸν Δαφνοῦντα καὶ προσχωρεῖν σφίσιν ·
Astyochus, happening at that time to be collecting at Chios the hostages taken in consequence of the conspiracy, ceased from that, when he found that the ships with Theramenes were come, and that the affairs of the confederacy were more prosperous.


8.31.2
5564
ξυνεκέλευε δὲ καὶ Τάμως Ἰωνίας ὕπαρχος ὤν .
And taking a squadron consisting of ten Peloponnesian and as many Chian ships, he put out to sea, and after attacking Pteleum without taking it, coasted along to Clazomenae, and commanded those of them who favoured the Athenian cause to remove inland to Daphnus, and to join their party. Tamos also, who was lieutenant-governor of Ionia, united in this command.


8.31.3
5565
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἐσήκουον , προσβολὴν ποιησάμενος τῇ πόλει οὔσῃ ἀτειχίστῳ καὶ οὐ δυνάμενος ἑλεῖν , ἀπέπλευσεν ἀνέμῳ μεγάλῳ αὐτὸς μὲν ἐς Φώκαιαν καὶ Κύμην , αἱ δὲ ἄλλαι νῆες κατῆραν ἐς τὰς ἐπικειμένας ταῖς Κλαζομεναῖς νήσους , Μαραθοῦσσαν καὶ Πήλην καὶ Δρυμοῦσσαν .
When they did not listen to it, he made an attack on the town, which was unwalled, and not being able to take it, sailed away before a strong gale himself to Phocaea and Cuma, while the rest of the ships put into the islands adjacent to Clazomenae, namely, Marathussa Pele, and Drymussa.


8.31.4
5566
καὶ ὅσα ὑπεξέκειτο αὐτόθι τῶν Κλαζομενίων , ἡμέρας ἐμμείναντες διὰ τοὺς ἀνέμους ὀκτὼ τὰ μὲν διήρπασαν καὶ ἀνήλωσαν , τὰ δὲ ἐσβαλόμενοι ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς Φώκαιαν καὶ Κύμην ὡς Ἀστύοχον .
Having staid there on account of the winds eight days, all the property of the Clazomenians that had been secretly stowed away there, they partly ravaged and consumed, and partly put on board their ships; and then sailed off to Phocaea and Cuma, to join Astyochus.


8.32.1
5567
ὄντος δ’ αὐτοῦ ἐνταῦθα Λεσβίων ἀφικνοῦνται πρέσβεις βουλόμενοι αὖθις ἀποστῆναι ·
While he was there, ambassadors from the Lesbians came to him, wishing to revolt again.


8.32.1
5568
καὶ αὐτὸν μὲν πείθουσιν , ὡς δ’ οἵ τε Κορίνθιοι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ξύμμαχοι ἀπρόθυμοι ἦσαν διὰ τὸ πρότερον σφάλμα , ἄρας ἔπλει ἐπὶ τῆς Χίου .
And as far as he was concerned, they gained his assent; but when the Corinthians and other allies were not zealous for it, in consequence of their former failure, he weighed anchor and sailed for Chios;


8.32.1
5569
καὶ χειμασθεισῶν τῶν νεῶν ὕστερον ἀφικνοῦνται ἄλλαι ἄλλοθεν ἐς τὴν Χίον .
at which place, after his ships had been dispersed in a storm, they arrived from different directions.


8.32.2
5570
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο Πεδάριτος , τότε παριὼν πεζῇ ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου , γενόμενος ἐν Ἐρυθραῖς διαπεραιοῦται αὐτός τε καὶ ἡ στρατιὰ ἐς Χίον ·
After this, Pedaritus, who when we last mentioned him was moving along the coast by land from Miletus, arrived at Erythrae, and then passed over, himself and his forces, to Chios;


8.32.2
5571
ὑπῆρχον δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ ἐκ τῶν πέντε νεῶν στρατιῶται ὑπὸ Χαλκιδέως ἐς πεντακοσίους ξὺν ὅπλοις καταλειφθέντες .
where he had also about five hundred soldiers who had been left by Chalcideus from the five ships, with their arms.


8.32.3
5572
ἐπαγγελλομένων δέ τινων Λεσβίων τὴν ἀπόστασιν , προσφέρει τῷ τε Πεδαρίτῳ καὶ τοῖς Χίοις ὁ Ἀστύοχος τὸν λόγον ὡς χρὴ παραγενομένους ταῖς ναυσὶν ἀποστῆσαι τὴν λέσβον ·
And when certain Lesbians made offers of revolt, Astyochus urged to Pedaritus and the Chians, that they ought to go with their ships, and effect the revolt of Lesbos;


8.32.3
5573
ἢ γὰρ ξυμμάχους πλείους σφᾶς ἕξειν , ἢ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , ἤν τι σφάλλωνται ,κακώσειν .
for so they would either themselves gain an addition to the number of their allies, or, in case of failure, would still do the Athenians mischief.


8.32.3
5574
οἱ δ’ οὐκ ἐσήκουον , οὐδὲ τὰς ναῦς ὁ Πεδάριτος ἔφη τῶν Χίων αὐτῷ προήσειν .
They, however, did not listen to them, and Pedaritus refused to give up to him the ships of the Chians.


8.33.1
5575
κ- ἐκεῖνος λαβὼν τάς τε τῶν Κορινθίων πέντε καὶ ἕκτην Μεγαρίδα καὶ μίαν Ἑρμιονίδα καὶ ἃς αὐτὸς Λακωνικὰς ἔχων ἦλθεν , ἔπλει ἐπὶ τῆς Μιλήτου πρὸς τὴν ναυαρχίαν , πολλὰ ἀπειλήσας τοῖς Χίοις ἦ μὴν μὴ ἐπιβοηθήσειν , ἤν τι δέωνται .
He, therefore, taking the five of the Corinthians, a sixth from Megara, one from Hermione, and those of the Lacedaemonians which he had come with, sailed for Miletus, to take the command as admiral, after many threats to the Chians that assuredly he would not come to their aid, should they be in any need of it.


8.33.2
5576
καὶ προσβαλὼν Κωρύκῳ τῆς Ἐρυθραίας ἐνηυλίσατο .
Having touched at Corycus, in the Erythraean country, he stayed there the night.


8.33.2
5577
οἱ δ’ ἀπὸ τῆς Σάμου Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ τὴν Χίον πλέοντες τῇ στρατιᾷ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ θάτερα λόφου διείργοντο καὶ καθωρμίσαντο καὶ ἐλελήθεσαν ἀλλήλους .
The Athenians also, on their passage from Samos to Chios with their troops, were only parted from them by being on the other side of a hill; and so they brought to for the night, and escaped each other's notice.


8.33.3
5578
ἐλθούσης δὲ παρὰ Πεδαρίτου ὑπὸ νύκτα ἐπιστολῆς ὡς Ἐρυθραίων ἄνδρες αἰχμάλωτοι ἐκ Σάμου ἐπὶ προδοσίᾳ ἐς Ἐρυθρὰς ἥκουσιν ἀφειμένοι , ἀνάγεται ὁ Ἀστύοχος εὐθὺς ἐς τὰς Ἐρυθρὰς πάλιν , καὶ παρὰ τοσοῦτον ἐγένετο αὐτῷ μὴ περιπεσεῖν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις .
On the arrival of a letter from Pedaritus in the night, to say that some Erythraean prisoners, after being set at liberty, had come from Samos to Erythraea for the purpose of betraying it, Astyochus immediately weighed anchor again for Erythraea: within so little was he of falling in with the Athenians.


8.33.4
5579
διαπλεύσας δὲ καὶ ὁ Πεδάριτος πρὸς αὐτόν , καὶ ἀναζητήσαντες τὰ περὶ τῶν δοκούντων προδιδόναι , ὡς ηὗρον ἅπαν ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐκ τῆς Σάμου προφασισθέν , ἀπολύσαντες τῆς αἰτίας ἀπέπλευσαν ὁ μὲν ἐς τὴν Χίον , ὁ δὲ ἐς τὴν Μίλητον ἐκομίσθη , ὥσπερ διενοεῖτο .
Pedaritus also sailed across to join him; and having investigated the case of the men who were thought to be traitors, when they found that the whole story had been made up in order to effect the escape of the men from Samos, they acquitted them of the charge, and sailed away, one to Chios, the other to Miletus, as he had intended.


8.34.1
5580
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ καὶ ἡ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατιὰ ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐκ τοῦ Κωρύκου περιπλέουσα κατ’ Ἀργῖνον ἐπιτυγχάνει τρισὶ ναυσὶ τῶν Χίων μακραῖς , καὶ ὡς εἶδον , ἐδίωκον ·
In the meantime also the army of the Athenians, while sailing round with the ships from Corycus, met with three Chian vessels of war off Arginus, and on seeing them gave them chase;


8.34.1
5581
καὶ χειμών τε μέγας ἐπιγίγνεται καὶ αἱ μὲν τῶν Χίων μόλις καταφεύγουσιν ἐς τὸν λιμένα , αἱ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων αἱ μὲν μάλιστα ὁρμήσασαι τρεῖς διαφθείρονται καὶ ἐκπίπτουσι πρὸς τὴν πόλιν τῶν Χίων , καὶ ἄνδρες οἱ μὲν ἁλίσκονται , οἱ δ’ ἀποθνῄσκουσιν , αἱ δ’ ἄλλαι καταφεύγουσιν ἐς τὸν ὑπὸ τῷ Μίμαντι λιμένα Φοινικοῦντα καλούμενον .
when a violent storm came on, and the Chian ships with difficulty took refuge in the harbour. Of the Athenians, the three which had pursued most vigorously were wrecked, and thrown up near the city of Chios, the men being either taken prisoners or slain; while the remainder took refuge in the harbour under Mount Mimas, called Phoenicus,


8.34.1
5582
ἐντεῦθεν δ’ ὕστερον ἐς τὴν Λέσβον καθορμισάμενοι παρεσκευάζοντο ἐς τὸν τειχισμόν .
from whence they afterwards came to anchor in the port of Lesbos, and made preparations for the work of fortification.


8.35.1
5583
ἐκ δὲ τῆς Πελοποννήσου τοῦ αὐτοῦ χειμῶνος Ἱπποκράτης ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος ἐκπλεύσας δέκα μὲν Θουρίαις ναυσίν , ὧν ἦρχε Δωριεὺς ὁ Διαγόρου τρίτος αὐτός , μιᾷ δὲ Λακωνικῇ , μιᾷ δὲ Συρακοσίᾳ , καταπλεῖ ἐς Κνίδον ·
The same winter, Hippocrates the Lacedaemonian, having sailed from the Peloponnese with ten Thurian ships under the command of Dorieus son of Diagoras, and two colleagues, one Laconian and one Syracusan,


8.35.1
5584
ἡ δ’ ἀφειστήκει ἤδη ὑπὸ Τισσαφέρνους .
sailed into port at Cnidus, which had now revolted at the instigation of Tissaphernes.


8.35.2
5585
καὶ αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ , ὡς ᾔσθοντο , ἐκέλευον ταῖς μὲν ἡμισείαις τῶν νεῶν Κνίδον φυλάσσειν , ταῖς δὲ περὶ Τριόπιον οὔσαις τὰς ἀπ’ Αἰγύπτου ὁλκάδας προσβαλλούσας ξυλλαμβάνειν ·
When those at Miletus received intelligence of them, they gave orders for half of the vessels to keep guard at Cnidus,


8.35.2
5586
ἔστι δὲ τὸ Τριόπιον ἄκρα τῆς Κνιδίας προύχουσα , Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερόν .
and the other half to cruise around Triopium, and seize the merchantmen that were approaching from Egypt. This Triopium is a promontory running out from the Cnidian territory, and is consecrated to Apollo.


8.35.3
5587
πυθόμενοι δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ πλεύσαντες ἐκ τῆς Σάμου λαμβάνουσι τὰς ἐπὶ τῷ Τριοπίῳ φρουρούσας ἓξ ναῦς ·
But the Athenians, having had notice of it, and having sailed out from Samos, seized the six ships that were keeping guard at Triopium,


8.35.3
5588
οἱ δ’ ἄνδρες ἀποφεύγουσιν ἐξ αὐτῶν .
though the crews escaped from them.


8.35.3
5589
καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἐς τὴν Κνίδον καταπλεύσαντες καὶ προσβαλόντες τῇ πόλει ἀτειχίστῳ οὔσῃ ὀλίγου εἷλον .
After this they put in at Cnidus, and having assaulted the city, which was unfortified, were within a little of taking it.


8.35.4
5590
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ αὖθις προσέβαλλον , καὶ ὡς ἄμεινον φαρξαμένων αὐτῶν ὑπὸ νύκτα καὶ ἐπεσελθόντων αὐτοῖς τῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ Τριοπίου ἐκ τῶν νεῶν διαφυγόντων οὐκέθ’ ὁμοίως ἔβλαπτον , ἀπελθόντες καὶ δῃώσαντες τὴν τῶν Κνιδίων γῆν ἐς τὴν Σάμον ἀπέπλευσαν .
but as they did not now do it so much damage, since the inhabitants had provided better defences during the night, and the crews which had escaped from the ships at Triopium had gone in to join them, they withdrew, and after ravaging the territory of the Cnidians, sailed back to Samos.


8.36.1
5591
ὑπὸ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον Ἀστυόχου ἥκοντος ἐς τὴν Μίλητον ἐπὶ τὸ ναυτικὸν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι εὐπόρως ἔτι εἶχον ἅπαντα τὰ κατὰ τὸ στρατόπεδον ·
Astyochus having come about the same time to the fleet at Miletus, the Peloponnesians were still abundantly supplied with every thing in their camp.


8.36.1
5592
καὶ γὰρ μισθὸς ἐδίδοτο ἀρκούντως καὶ τὰ ἐκ τῆς Ἰάσου μεγάλα χρήματα διαρπασθέντα ὑπῆν τοῖς στρατιώταις , οἵ τε Μιλήσιοι προθύμως τὰ τοῦ πολέμου ἔφερον .
For pay was given them to a sufficiently large amount, and the great sum of money which had been raised from the plunder of Iasus was still at the command of the soldiers, and the Milesians carried on the war with spirit.


8.36.2
5593
πρὸς δὲ τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ἐδόκουν ὅμως τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις αἱ πρῶται ξυνθῆκαι αἱ πρὸς Χαλκιδέα γενόμεναι ἐνδεεῖς εἶναι καὶ οὐ πρὸς σφῶν μᾶλλον , καὶ ἄλλας ἔτι Θηριμένους παρόντος ἐποίουν ·
Nevertheless the Peloponnesians considered that the first convention with Tissaphernes, which had been concluded by Chalcideus, was defective, and not so much for their advantage [as for his];


8.36.2
5594
καὶ εἰσὶν αἵδε .
Here is the broken-down English translation corresponding to the Greek chunks:


8.37.1
5595
&quot; ξυνθῆκαι Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων πρὸς βασιλέα Δαρεῖον καὶ τοὺς παῖδας τοὺς βασιλέως καὶ Τισσαφέρνην , σπονδὰς εἶναι καὶ φιλίαν κατὰ τάδε .
" The convention of the Lacedaemonians and the allies with King Darius, the sons of the king, and Tissaphernes, that there should be a treaty and friendship between them on these terms:"


8.37.2
5596
ὁπόση χώρα καὶ πόλεις βασιλέως εἰσὶ Δαρείου ἢ τοῦ πατρὸς ἦσαν ἢ τῶν προγόνων , ἐπὶ ταύτας μὴ ἰέναι ἐπὶ πολέμῳ μηδὲ κακῷ μηδενὶ μήτε Λακεδαιμονίους μήτε τοὺς ξυμμάχους τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίων , μηδὲ φόρους πράσσεσθαι ἐκ τῶν πόλεων τούτων μήτε Λακεδαιμονίους μήτε τοὺς ξυμμάχους τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίων ·
"Whatever territory and cities belong to King Darius, or did belong to his father, or his ancestors, against these neither the Lacedaemonians nor the allies of the Lacedaemonians shall be permitted to proceed for the purpose of war, or for any harm: neither shall the Lacedaemonians, nor their confederates, exact tribute from these cities.


8.37.2
5597
μηδὲ Δαρεῖον βασιλέα μηδὲ ὧν βασιλεὺς ἄρχει ἐπὶ Λακεδαιμονίους μηδὲ τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἰέναι ἐπὶ πολέμῳ μηδὲ κακῷ μηδενί .
Neither shall King Darius, or any states in the king's dominions, be allowed to proceed against the Lacedaemonians, or their allies, for the purpose of war or other injury."


8.37.3
5598
ἢν δέ τι δέωνται Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἢ οἱ ξύμμαχοι βασιλέως ἢ βασιλεὺς Λακεδαιμονίων ἢ τῶν ξυμμάχων , ὅτι ἂν πείθωσιν ἀλλήλους , τοῦτο ποιοῦσι καλῶς ἔχειν .
" to whatever they may gain each other's assent, that shall be right for them to do.——Both parties shall carry on in common the war against the Athenians and their allies;"


8.37.4
5599
τὸν δὲ πόλεμον τὸν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους κοινῇ ἀμφοτέρους πολεμεῖν ·
"Should the Lacedaemonians, or their allies, require any assistance from the king, or the king stand in need of any from the Lacedaemonians, or their allies;


8.37.4
5600
ἢν δὲ κατάλυσιν ποιῶνται , κοινῇ ἀμφοτέρους ποιεῖσθαι .
and should they come to terms of peace, they shall both do so in common.


8.37.4
5601
ὁπόση δ’ ἂν στρατιὰ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῇ βασιλέως ᾖ μεταπεμψαμένου βασιλέως , τὴν δαπάνην βασιλέα παρέχειν .
Whatever troops shall be in the king's country in consequence of the king's having sent for them, the king shall pay their expenses."


8.37.5
5602
ἢν δέ τις τῶν πόλεων ὁπόσαι ξυνέθεντο βασιλεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλέως ἴῃ χώραν , τοὺς ἄλλους κωλύειν καὶ ἀμύνειν βασιλεῖ κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν ·
"Should any of the states which have concluded this convention with the king proceed against the king's country, the rest shall prevent it, and assist the king to the utmost of their power.


8.37.5
5603
καὶ ἤν τις τῶν ἐν τῇ βασιλέως χώρᾳ ἢ ὅσης βασιλεὺς ἄρχει ἐπὶ τὴν Λακεδαιμονίων ἴῃ ἢ τῶν ξυμμάχων , βασιλεὺς κωλυέτω καὶ ἀμυνέτω κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν &quot; .
And should any of those in the king's country, or in all his dominions, proceed against the country of the Lacedaemonians, or of their allies, the king shall prevent it, and assist them to the utmost of his power."


8.38.1
5604
μετὰ δὲ ταύτας τὰς ξυνθήκας Θηριμένης μὲν παραδοὺς Ἀστυόχῳ τὰς ναῦς ἀποπλέων ἐν κέλητι ἀφανίζεται , οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Λέσβου Ἀθηναῖοι ἤδη διαβεβηκότες ἐς τὴν Χίον τῇ στρατιᾷ καὶ κρατοῦντες καὶ γῆς καὶ θαλάσσης Δελφίνιον ἐτείχιζον , χωρίον ἄλλως τε ἐκ γῆς καρτερὸν καὶ λιμένας ἔχον καὶ τῆς τῶν Χίων πόλεως οὐ πολὺ ἀπέχον .
After this convention Theramenes gave up the fleet to Astyochus, and sailing away in a small boat was lost at sea.


8.38.3
5605
οἱ δὲ Χῖοι ἐν πολλαῖς ταῖς πρὶν μάχαις πεπληγμένοι , καὶ ἄλλως ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς οὐ πάνυ εὖ διακείμενοι , ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν μετὰ Τυδέως τοῦ Ἴωνος ἤδη ὑπὸ Πεδαρίτου ἐπ’ ἀττικισμῷ τεθνεώτων καὶ τῆς ἄλλης πόλεως κατ’ ἀνάγκην ἐς ὀλίγους κατεχομένης ὑπόπτως διακείμενοι ἀλλήλοις ἡσύχαζον , καὶ οὔτ’ αὐτοὶ διὰ ταῦτα οὔθ’ οἱ μετὰ Πεδαρίτου ἐπίκουροι ἀξιόμαχοι αὐτοῖς ἐφαίνοντο .
Now the Chians having been beaten in several previous engagements, and not being on very good terms amongst themselves, but regarding each other with suspicion, because Tydeus, son of Ion, and his party had already been executed by Pedaritus on the charge of Atticism, and the rest of the city was by compulsion reduced to an oligarchy; in consequence of these things they kept quiet, and thought neither themselves nor the mercenaries under Pedaritus to be a match for the enemy.


8.38.4
5606
ἐς μέντοι τὴν Μίλητον ἔπεμπον κελεύοντες σφίσι τὸν Ἀστύοχον βοηθεῖν ·
They sent, however, to Miletus, urging Astyochus to come to their aid:


8.38.4
5607
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἐσήκουεν , ἐπιστέλλει περὶ αὐτοῦ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα ὁ Πεδάριτος ὡς ἀδικοῦντος .
and when he did not listen to them, Pedaritus sent a letter to Lacedaemon, representing him as being guilty of a misdemeanor.


8.38.5
5608
καὶ τὰ μὲν ἐν τῇ Χίῳ ἐς τοῦτο καθειστήκει τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ·
On this footing stood the affairs of the Athenians at Chios:


8.38.5
5609
αἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Σάμου νῆες αὐτοῖς ἐπίπλους μὲν ἐποιοῦντο ταῖς ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ , ἐπεὶ δὲ μὴ ἀντανάγοιεν , ἀναχωροῦντες πάλιν ἐς τὴν Σάμον ἡσύχαζον .
while from Samos their ships kept sailing out against those at Miletus, and when they did not advance to meet them, they returned again to Samos, and remained quiet.


8.39.1
5610
ἐκ δὲ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ χειμῶνι αἱ τῷ Φαρναβάζῳ ὑπὸ Καλλιγείτου τοῦ Μεγαρέως καὶ Τιμαγόρου τοῦ Κυζικηνοῦ πρασσόντων παρασκευασθεῖσαι ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων ἑπτὰ καὶ εἴκοσι νῆες ἄρασαι ἔπλεον ἐπὶ Ἰωνίας περὶ ἡλίου τροπάς , καὶ ἄρχων ἐπέπλει αὐτῶν Ἀντισθένης Σπαρτιάτης .
The same winter, the seven and thirty ships which had been equipped by the Lacedaemonians for Pharnabazus, through the instrumentality of Calligitus the Megarean and Timagoras the Cyzicene, put out from the Peloponnese, and sailed for Ionia, about the period of the solstice, Antisthenes a Spartan being on board in command of them.


8.39.2
5611
ξυνέπεμψαν δὲ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ ἕνδεκα ἄνδρας Σπαρτιατῶν ξυμβούλους Ἀστυόχῳ , ὧν εἷς ἦν Λίχας ὁ Ἀρκεσιλάου ·
The Lacedaemonians also sent eleven Spartans as assistant counsellors for Astyochus, one of whom was Lichas, the son of Arcesilaus.


8.39.2
5612
καὶ εἴρητο αὐτοῖς ἐς Μίλητον ἀφικομένους τῶν τε ἄλλων ξυνεπιμέλεσθαι ᾗ μέλλει ἄριστα ἕξειν , καὶ τὰς ναῦς ταύτας ἢ αὐτὰς ἢ πλείους ἢ καὶ ἐλάσσους ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ὡς Φαρνάβαζον , ἢν δοκῇ , ἀποπέμπειν , Κλέαρχον τὸν Ῥαμφίου , ὃς ξυνέπλει , ἄρχοντα προστάξαντας , καὶ Ἀστύοχον , ἢν δοκῇ τοῖς ἕνδεκα ἀνδράσι , παύειν τῆς ναυαρχίας , Ἀντισθένη δὲ καθιστάναι ·
They were instructed on their arrival at Miletus to co-operate in the arrangement of all other affairs, as should be best, and to despatch these vessels—either just the number, more, or fewer—to the Hellespont to join Pharnabazus, should they think proper, appointing to the command of them Clearchus the son of Ramphias, who sailed out with them; and also, if the eleven commissioners deemed fit, to depose Astyochus from the office of admiral, and appoint Antisthenes; for they were suspicious of him in consequence of the letters from Pedaritus.


8.39.2
5613
πρὸς γὰρ τὰς τοῦ Πεδαρίτου ἐπιστολὰς ὑπώπτευον αὐτόν .
Sailing therefore from Malea across the open sea the squadron touched at Melos, and there falling in with ten Athenian ships took three of them empty, and burnt them.


8.39.3
5614
πλέουσαι οὖν αἱ νῆες ἀπὸ Μαλέας πελάγιαι Μήλῳ προσέβαλον , καὶ περιτυχόντες ναυσὶ δέκα Ἀθηναίων τὰς τρεῖς λαμβάνουσι κενὰς καὶ κατακαίουσιν .
After this, being afraid that those of the Athenian vessels which had escaped from Melos might (as was the case) give information of their approach to those at Samos, they sailed to Crete,


8.39.3
5615
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο δεδιότες μὴ αἱ διαφυγοῦσαι τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐκ τῆς Μήλου νῆες , ὅπερ ἐγένετο , μηνύσωσι τοῖς ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ τὸν ἐπίπλουν αὐτῶν , πρὸς τὴν Κρήτην πλεύσαντες καὶ πλείω τὸν πλοῦν διὰ φυλακῆς ποιησάμενοι ἐς τὴν Καῦνον τῆς Ἀσίας κατῆραν .
and having made their voyage longer by taking this precaution, they made the land at Caunus, in Asia;


8.39.4
5616
ἐντεῦθεν δὴ ὡς ἐν ἀσφαλεῖ ὄντες ἀγγελίαν ἔπεμπον ἐπὶ τὰς ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ ναῦς τοῦ ξυμπαρακομισθῆναι .
from which place, considering themselves to be now in safety, they sent a message to the ships at Miletus, in order to be convoyed by them along the coast.


8.40.1
5617
οἱ δὲ Χῖοι καὶ Πεδάριτος κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον οὐδὲν ἧσσον , καίπερ διαμέλλοντα , τὸν Ἀστύοχον πέμποντες ἀγγέλους ἠξίουν σφίσι πολιορκουμένοις βοηθῆσαι ἁπάσαις ταῖς ναυσὶ καὶ μὴ περιιδεῖν τὴν μεγίστην τῶν ἐν Ἰωνίᾳ ξυμμαχίδων πόλεων ἔκ τε θαλάσσης εἰργομένην καὶ κατὰ γῆν λῃστείαις πορθουμένην .
At this same time the Chians and Pedaritus sent messengers to Astyochus, notwithstanding his holding back, and begged him to succour them in their siege with all his fleet, and not to permit the largest of the allied cities in Ionia to be both excluded from the use of the sea, and wasted by forays on the land.


8.40.2
5618
οἱ γὰρ οἰκέται τοῖς Χίοις πολλοὶ ὄντες καὶ μιᾷ γε πόλει πλὴν Λακεδαιμονίων πλεῖστοι γενόμενοι καὶ ἅμα διὰ τὸ πλῆθος χαλεπωτέρως ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις κολαζόμενοι , ὡς ἡ στρατιὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων βεβαίως ἔδοξε μετὰ τείχους ἱδρῦσθαι , εὐθὺς αὐτομολίᾳ τε ἐχώρησαν οἱ πολλοὶ πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰ πλεῖστα κακὰ ἐπιστάμενοι τὴν χώραν οὗτοι ἔδρασαν .
For the slaves of the Chians being numerous, and indeed forming the largest body there was in any one city, except that of the Lacedaemonians, and at the same time being, in consequence of their great numbers, punished more severely than usual in cases of offence, when the Athenian army appeared to be firmly established, with the advantage of a fortified position, the greater part deserted to them; and these did the most mischief to the country, through their acquaintance with it.


8.40.3
5619
ἔφασαν οὖν χρῆναι οἱ Χῖοι , ἕως ἔτι ἐλπὶς καὶ δυνατὸν κωλῦσαι , τειχιζομένου τοῦ Δελφινίου καὶ ἀτελοῦς ὄντος καὶ στρατοπέδῳ καὶ ναυσὶν ἐρύματος μείζονος προσπεριβαλλομένου , βοηθῆσαι σφίσιν .
The Chians therefore represented, that while there was still a hope and possibility of stopping them, while Delphinium was still being fortified, and not yet completed, and a higher wall was being erected round their camp and the ships, it was incumbent on him to assist them.


8.40.3
5620
ὁ δὲ Ἀστύοχος καίπερ οὐ διανοούμενος διὰ τὴν τότε ἀπειλήν , ὡς ἑώρα καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους προθύμους ὄντας , ὥρμητο ἐς τὸ βοηθεῖν .
And although Astyochus, because of his threat on the occasion already mentioned, had not intended to do it, when he saw that the allies also were anxious for their relief, he set out to succour them.


8.41.1
5621
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἐκ τῆς Καύνου παραγίγνεται ἀγγελία ὅτι αἱ ἑπτὰ καὶ εἴκοσι νῆες καὶ οἱ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ξύμβουλοι πάρεισιν ·
In the mean time tidings came from Caunus that the seven and twenty ships, with the Lacedaemonian counsellors, were come.


8.41.1
5622
καὶ νομίσας πάντα ὕστερα εἶναι τ- ἄλλα πρὸς τὸ ναῦς τε , ὅπως θαλασσοκρατοῖεν μᾶλλον , τοσαύτας ξυμπαρακομίσαι , καὶ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , οἳ ἧκον κατάσκοποι αὐτοῦ , ἀσφαλῶς περαιωθῆναι , εὐθὺς ἀφεὶς τὸ ἐς τὴν Χίον ἔπλει ἐς τὴν Καῦνον .
And thinking every thing else of secondary importance, compared with his convoying so large a number of ships, in order that they might more entirely command the sea, and with the safe passage of the Lacedaemonians who had come to observe his conduct, he immediately gave up going to the relief of Chios, and sailed to Caunus.


8.41.2
5623
καὶ ἐς Κῶν τὴν Μεροπίδα ἐν τῷ παράπλῳ ἀποβὰς τήν τε πόλιν ἀτείχιστον οὖσαν καὶ ὑπὸ σεισμοῦ , ὃς αὐτοῖς ἔτυχε μέγιστός γε δὴ ὧν μεμνήμεθα γενόμενος , ξυμπεπτωκυῖαν ἐκπορθεῖ , τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐς τὰ ὄρη πεφευγότων , καὶ τὴν χώραν καταδρομαῖς λείαν ἐποιεῖτο , πλὴν τῶν ἐλευθέρων ·
Having landed, as he coasted along, at Cos Meropis, which was unfortified, and in ruins in consequence of an earthquake which they had experienced—the most violent one which I ever remember—he sacked the town, the men having fled to the mountains,


8.41.2
5624
τούτους δὲ ἀφίει .
and by incursions made spoil of the country, excepting the free population, whom he released.


8.41.3
5625
ἐκ δὲ τῆς Κῶ ἀφικόμενος ἐς τὴν Κνίδον νυκτὸς ἀναγκάζεται ὑπὸ τῶν Κνιδίων παραινούντων μὴ ἐκβιβάσαι τοὺς ναύτας , ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ εἶχε πλεῖν εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ναῦς εἴκοσιν , ἃς ἔχων Χαρμῖνος εἷς τῶν ἐκ Σάμου στρατηγῶν ἐφύλασσε ταύτας τὰς ἑπτὰ καὶ εἴκοσι ναῦς ἐκ τῆς Πελοποννήσου προσπλεούσας , ἐφ’ ἅσπερ καὶ ὁ Ἀστύοχος παρέπλει .
Having come from Cos to Cnidus by night, he was constrained by the advice of the Cnidians not to land his seamen, but to sail, just as he was, straightway against the twenty Athenian ships with which Charminus, one of the generals at Samos, was on the look-out for those seven and twenty ships that were approaching from the Peloponnese, and to join which Astyochus also was coasting along.


8.41.4
5626
ἐπύθοντο δὲ οἱ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ ἐκ τῆς Μήλου τὸν ἐπίπλουν αὐτῶν , καὶ ἡ φυλακὴ τῷ Χαρμίνῳ περὶ τὴν Σύμην καὶ Χάλκην καὶ Ῥόδον καὶ περὶ τὴν Λυκίαν ἦν ·
For those at Samos had heard from Melos of their approach, and Charminus was watching for them about Syme, Chalce, Rhodes, and Lycia;


8.41.4
5627
ἤδη γὰρ ᾐσθάνετο καὶ ἐν τῇ Καύνῳ οὔσας αὐτάς .
as by this time he was aware of their being at Caunus.


8.42.1
5628
ἐπέπλει οὖν ὥσπερ εἶχε πρὸς τὴν Σύμην ὁ Ἀστύοχος πρὶν ἔκπυστος γενέσθαι , εἴ πως περιλάβοι που μετεώρους τὰς ναῦς .
Astyochus therefore sailed immediately to Syme, before he was heard of, on the chance of finding the ships some where out at sea.


8.42.1
5629
καὶ αὐτῷ ὑετός τε καὶ τὰ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ξυννέφελα ὄντα πλάνησιν τῶν νεῶν ἐν τῷ σκότει καὶ ταραχὴν παρέσχεν .
But the rain and the cloudy state of the atmosphere which he encountered caused the dispersion of his ships during the dark, and threw them into confusion.


8.42.2
5630
καὶ ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ διεσπασμένου τοῦ ναυτικοῦ καὶ τοῦ μὲν φανεροῦ ἤδη ὄντος τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τοῦ εὐωνύμου κέρως , τοῦ δὲ ἄλλου περὶ τὴν νῆσον ἔτι πλανωμένου , ἐπανάγονται κατὰ τάχος ὁ Χαρμῖνος καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐλάσσοσιν ἢ ταῖς εἴκοσι ναυσί , νομίσαντες ἅσπερ ἐφύλασσον ναῦς τὰς ἀπὸ τῆς Καύνου ταύτας εἶναι .
In the morning, when his fleet had been separated, and the left wing was now in sight of the Athenians, while the rest of it was still dispersed around the island, Charminus and the Athenians put out against it with all speed, with fewer than their twenty ships, thinking that these were the vessels they were watching for, namely, those from Caunus.


8.42.3
5631
καὶ προσπεσόντες εὐθὺς κατέδυσάν τε τρεῖς καὶ κατετραυμάτισαν ἄλλας , καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ ἐπεκράτουν , μέχρι οὗ ἐπεφάνησαν αὐτοῖς παρὰ δόξαν αἱ πλείους τῶν νεῶν καὶ πανταχόθεν ἀπεκλῄοντο .
Having attacked them therefore immediately, they sank three, and severely damaged some others, and had the advantage in the action, until the larger division of the fleet unexpectedly came in sight, and they were surrounded on every side.


8.42.4
5632
ἔπειτα δὲ ἐς φυγὴν καταστάντες ἓξ μὲν ναῦς ἀπολλύασι , ταῖς δὲ λοιπαῖς καταφεύγουσιν ἐς τὴν Τευτλοῦσσαν νῆσον , ἐντεῦθεν δὲ ἐς Ἁλικαρνασσόν .
Then they took to flight, and having lost six ships, fled for refuge with the rest to the island of Teutlussa, and thence to Halicarnassus.


8.42.4
5633
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οἱ μὲν Πελοποννήσιοι ἐς Κνίδον κατάραντες καὶ ξυμμιγεισῶν τῶν ἐκ τῆς Καύνου ἑπτὰ καὶ εἴκοσι νεῶν αὐτοῖς ξυμπάσαις πλεύσαντες καὶ τροπαῖον ἐν τῇ Σύμῃ στήσαντες πάλιν ἐς τὴν Κνίδον καθωρμίσαντο ·
After this the Peloponnesians put into Cnidus, and the seven and twenty ships from Caunus having effected a junction with them, they sailed with the whole number, and erected a trophy on Syme, and then came to anchor again at Cnidus.


8.43.1
5634
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ταῖς ἐκ τῆς Σάμου ναυσὶ πάσαις , ὡς ᾔσθοντο τὰ τῆς ναυμαχίας , πλεύσαντες ἐς τὴν Σύμην καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν τὸ ἐν τῇ Κνίδῳ ναυτικὸν οὐχ ὁρμήσαντες , οὐδ’ ἐκεῖνοι ἐπ’ ἐκείνους , λαβόντες δὲ τὰ ἐν τῇ Σύμῃ σκεύη τῶν νεῶν καὶ Λωρύμοις τοῖς ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ προσβαλόντες ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς τὴν Σάμον .
The Athenians, on hearing the particulars of the engagement, having sailed with all their ships from Samos to Syme, made no attack on the fleet at Cnidus, or that on them, but took their naval stores, which were at Syme, and after touching at Lorymi on the continent, sailed back to Samos. And now all the Peloponnesian ships at Cnidus were refitted, so far as they required it;


8.43.2
5635
ἅπασαι δ’ ἤδη οὖσαι ἅμα ἐν τῇ Κνίδῳ αἱ τῶν Πελοποννησίων νῆες ἐπεσκευάζοντό τε εἴ τι ἔδει καὶ πρὸς τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ( παρεγένετο γάρ ) λόγους ἐποιοῦντο οἱ ἕνδεκα ἄνδρες τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων περί τε τῶν ἤδη πεπραγμένων , εἴ τι μὴ ἤρεσκεν αὐτοῖς , καὶ περὶ τοῦ μέλλοντος πολέμου , ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἄριστα καὶ ξυμφορώτατα ἀμφοτέροις πολεμήσεται .
and the eleven Lacedaemonian commissioners held a conference with Tissaphernes, (for he had come to meet them,) both respecting what had already been done, if there was aught that did not please them, and with reference to future hostilities, in what way they might be conducted most to the benefit and advantage of both parties.


8.43.3
5636
μάλιστα δὲ ὁ Λίχας ἐσκόπει τὰ ποιούμενα , καὶ τὰς σπονδὰς οὐδετέρας , οὔτε τὰς Χαλκιδέως οὔτε τὰς Θηριμένους , ἔφη καλῶς ξυγκεῖσθαι , ἀλλὰ δεινὸν εἶναι εἰ χώρας ὅσης βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ πρόγονοι ἦρξαν πρότερον , ταύτης καὶ νῦν ἀξιώσει κρατεῖν ·
Lichas, more especially, kept an eye on the transactions, and said, that neither of the two treaties was properly drawn up, Neither that of Chalcideus, nor that of Theramenes,


8.43.3
5637
ἐνεῖναι γὰρ καὶ νήσους ἁπάσας πάλιν δουλεύειν καὶ Θεσσαλίαν καὶ Λοκροὺς καὶ τὰ μέχρι Βοιωτῶν , καὶ ἀντ’ ἐλευθερίας ἂν Μηδικὴν ἀρχὴν τοῖς Ἕλλησι τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους περιθεῖναι .
but it was a shameful thing that the king should even now claim to be master of all the country over which he and his ancestors had formerly had dominion. For in that was involved the re-subjugation of all the islands, with Thessaly, Locris, and as far as Boeotia; and so, instead of freedom, the Lacedaemonians would be putting the Median yoke on the Greeks.


8.43.4
5638
ἑτέρας οὖν ἐκέλευε βελτίους σπένδεσθαι , ἢ ταύταις γε οὐ χρήσεσθαι , οὐδὲ τῆς τροφῆς ἐπὶ τούτοις δεῖσθαι οὐδέν .
He told them therefore to conclude another and a better treaty, or at any rate they would not act according to this;


8.43.4
5639
ἀγανακτῶν δὲ ὁ μὲν Τισσαφέρνης ἀπεχώρησεν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν δι’ ὀργῆς καὶ ἄπρακτος ,
nor did they want any of his supplies on these terms. But Tissaphernes, being offended at this, went away from them in a rage, and without settling any thing.


8.44.1
5640
οἱ δ’ ἐς τὴν Ῥόδον ἐπικηρυκευομένων ἀπὸ τῶν δυνατωτάτων ἀνδρῶν τὴν γνώμην εἶχον πλεῖν , ἐλπίζοντες νῆσόν τε οὐκ ἀδύνατον καὶ ναυβατῶν πλήθει καὶ πεζῷ προσάξεσθαι , καὶ ἅμα ἡγούμενοι αὐτοὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ὑπαρχούσης ξυμμαχίας δυνατοὶ ἔσεσθαι Τισσαφέρνην μὴ αἰτοῦντες χρήματα τρέφειν τὰς ναῦς .
They, in consequence of communications from some of the most powerful men there, were disposed to sail to Rhodes; hoping to bring over to their side an island which was strong both in its number of seamen and its land forces; and moreover thinking that they should themselves be able to maintain their fleet from their own confederacy, without asking Tissaphernes for money.


8.44.2
5641
πλεύσαντες οὖν εὐθὺς ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ χειμῶνι ἐκ τῆς Κνίδου καὶ προσβαλόντες Καμείρῳ τῆς Ῥοδίας πρῶτον ναυσὶ τέσσαρσι καὶ ἐνενήκοντα ἐξεφόβησαν μὲν τοὺς πολλοὺς οὐκ εἰδότας τὰ πρασσόμενα , καὶ ἔφευγον , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἀτειχίστου οὔσης τῆς πόλεως ·
Having sailed therefore immediately, that same winter, from Cnidus, and having first put in with ninety-four ships to Camirus in the Rhodian territory,


8.44.2
5642
εἶτα ξυγκαλέσαντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τούτους τε καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τοῖν δυοῖν πολέοιν , Λίνδου καὶ Ἰηλυσοῦ , Ῥοδίους ἔπεισαν ἀποστῆναι Ἀθηναίων ·
they frightened away most of the inhabitants, who were not aware of their intentions, and therefore fled, especially as the town was unfortified.


8.44.2
5643
καὶ προσεχώρησε Ῥόδος Πελοποννησίοις .
Then, having assembled both these and the people from the two other towns, Lindus and Ialysus, the Lacedaemonians prevailed on the Rhodians to revolt from the Athenians.


8.44.3
5644
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ταῖς ἐκ τῆς Σάμου ναυσὶν αἰσθόμενοι ἔπλευσαν μὲν βουλόμενοι φθάσαι καὶ ἐπεφάνησαν πελάγιοι , ὑστερήσαντες δὲ οὐ πολλῷ τὸ μὲν παραχρῆμα ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς Χάλκην , ἐντεῦθεν δ’ ἐς Σάμον , ὕστερον δὲ ἐκ τῆς Χάλκης καὶ ἐκ τῆς Κῶ καὶ ἐκ τῆς Σάμου τοὺς ἐπίπλους ποιούμενοι ἐπὶ τὴν Ῥόδον ἐπολέμουν .
And so Rhodes joined the Peloponnesian confederacy. The Athenians, having got notice of it, sailed at this time with their ships from Samos, wishing to anticipate them, and came within sight of the island as they lay out at sea; but being a little too late, they sailed back in the first instance to Chalce, thence to Samos, and afterwards carried on the war against Rhodes by attacks from Chalce, Cos, and Samos.


8.44.4
5645
οἱ δὲ χρήματα μὲν ἐξέλεξαν ἐς δύο καὶ τριάκοντα τάλαντα οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι παρὰ τῶν Ῥοδίων , τὰ δ’ ἄλλα ἡσύχαζον ἡμέρας ὀγδοήκοντα , ἀνελκύσαντες τὰς ναῦς .
The Peloponnesians levied money from the Rhodians to the amount of two and thirty talents; but in other respects lay still for eighty days, having drawn up the ships on shore.


8.45.1
5646
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ καὶ ἔτι πρότερον , πρὶν ἐς τὴν Ῥόδον αὐτοὺς ἀναστῆναι , τάδε ἐπράσσετο .
In the mean time, and at even a still earlier period, before they removed to Rhodes, the following negotiations were being carried on.


8.45.1
5647
Ἀλκιβιάδης μετὰ τὸν Χαλκιδέως θάνατον καὶ τὴν ἐν Μιλήτῳ μάχην τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις ὕποπτος ὤν , καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἀφικομένης ἐπιστολῆς πρὸς Ἀστύοχον ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος ὥστ’ ἀποκτεῖναι ( ἦν γὰρ καὶ τῷ Ἄγιδι ἐχθρὸς καὶ ἄλλως ἄπιστος ἐφαίνετο ) , πρῶτον μὲν ὑποχωρεῖ δείσας παρὰ Τισσαφέρνην , ἔπειτα ἐκάκου πρὸς αὐτὸν ὅσον ἐδύνατο μάλιστα τῶν Πελοποννησίων τὰ πράγματα , καὶ διδάσκαλος πάντων γιγνόμενος τήν τε μισθοφορὰν ξυνέτεμεν , ἀντὶ δραχμῆς Ἀττικῆς ὥστε τριώβολον καὶ τοῦτο μὴ ξυνεχῶς δίδοσθαι , λέγειν κελεύων τὸν Τισσαφέρνην πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὡς Ἀθηναῖοι ἐκ πλέονος χρόνου ἐπιστήμονες ὄντες τοῦ ναυτικοῦ τριώβολον τοῖς ἑαυτῶν διδόασιν , οὐ τοσοῦτον πενίᾳ ὅσον ἵνα αὐτῶν μὴ οἱ ναῦται ἐκ περιουσίας ὑβρίζοντες οἱ μὲν τὰ σώματα χείρω ἔχωσι δαπανῶντες ἐς τοιαῦτα ἀφ’ ὧν ἡ ἀσθένεια ξυμβαίνει , οἱ δὲ τὰς ναῦς ἀπολείπωσιν οὐχ ὑπολιπόντες ἐς ὁμηρείαν τὸν προσοφειλόμενον μισθόν ·
Alcibiades being suspected by the Peloponnesians after the death of Chalcideus and the battle of Miletus, and instructions having been sent by them from Lacedaemon to Astyochus to put him to death, (for he was a personal enemy of Agis, and in other ways appeared to be unworthy of trust,) he first retired in alarm to the court of Tissaphernes, and then did the greatest harm he could to the cause of the Peloponnesians with him.


8.45.3
5648
καὶ τοὺς τριηράρχους καὶ τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν πόλεων ἐδίδασκεν ὥστε δόντα χρήματα αὐτὸν πεῖσαι , ὥστε ξυγχωρῆσαι ταῦτα ἑαυτῷ πλὴν τῶν Συρακοσίων ·
He also gave him such instructions, that by giving money he persuaded the trierarchs and generals of the different states to concede these points to him; excepting the Syracusans;


8.45.3
5649
τούτων δὲ Ἑρμοκράτης ἠναντιοῦτο μόνος ὑπὲρ τοῦ παντὸς ξυμμαχικοῦ .
but of these Hermocrates alone opposed him on behalf of the whole confederacy.


8.45.4
5650
τάς τε πόλεις δεομένας χρημάτων ἀπήλασεν αὐτὸς ἀντιλέγων ὑπὲρ τοῦ Τισσαφέρνους ὡς οἱ μὲν Χῖοι ἀναίσχυντοι εἶεν πλουσιώτατοι ὄντες τῶν Ἑλλήνων , ἐπικουρίᾳ δ’ ὅμως σῳζόμενοι ἀξιοῦσι καὶ τοῖς σώμασι καὶ τοῖς χρήμασιν ἄλλους ὑπὲρ τῆς ἐκείνων ἐλευθερίας κινδυνεύειν ·
The states, too, which applied for money he dismissed with an answer from himself, on the part of Tissaphernes, alleging by way of refusal, that the Chians were shameless, who, though the wealthiest of the Greeks, and being protected as they were by the aid they were receiving, expected others to risk both their persons and their purses for  liberty.


8.45.5
5651
τὰς δ’ ἄλλας πόλεις ἔφη ἀδικεῖν , αἳ ἐς Ἀθηναίους πρότερον ἢ ἀποστῆναι ἀνήλουν , εἰ μὴ καὶ νῦν καὶ τοσαῦτα καὶ ἔτι πλείω ὑπὲρ σφῶν αὐτῶν ἐθελήσουσιν ἐσφέρειν .
With regard to the rest of the states, which used before their revolt to lavish their money on the Athenians, he said that they were wrong if they would not now also contribute as much, or even more, for their own interests.


8.45.6
5652
τόν τε Τισσαφέρνην ἀπέφαινε νῦν μέν , τοῖς ἰδίοις χρήμασι πολεμοῦντα , εἰκότως φειδόμενον , ἢν δέ ποτε τροφὴ καταβῇ παρὰ βασιλέως , ἐντελῆ αὐτοῖς ἀποδώσειν τὸν μισθὸν καὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰ εἰκότα ὠφελήσειν .
He also represented that Tissaphernes was naturally sparing at present, inasmuch as he was carrying on the war with his own resources; but that if supplies should ever come down from the king, he would give them their full pay, and afford the states all proper relief.


8.46.1
5653
παρῄνει δὲ καὶ τῷ Τισσαφέρνει μὴ ἄγαν ἐπείγεσθαι τὸν πόλεμον διαλῦσαι , μηδὲ βουληθῆναι κομίσαντα ἢ ναῦς Φοινίσσας ἅσπερ παρεσκευάζετο ἢ Ἕλλησι πλέοσι μισθὸν πορίζοντα τοῖς αὐτοῖς τῆς τε γῆς καὶ τῆς θαλάσσης τὸ κράτος δοῦναι , ἔχειν δ’ ἀμφοτέρους ἐᾶν δίχα τὴν ἀρχήν , καὶ βασιλεῖ ἐξεῖναι αἰεὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς αὐτῷ λυπηροὺς τοὺς ἑτέρους ἐπάγειν .
He likewise advised Tissaphernes " not to be in too great a hurry to bring the war to a conclusion; nor to be anxious, by either bringing the Phoenician fleet which he was equipping, or giving pay to a larger body of Greeks, to confer on the same party the command both of land and sea; but to let them each hold a divided sway, and so leave the king the power at all times to lead the one party or the other against those who were annoying him."


8.46.2
5654
γενομένης δ’ ἂν καθ’ ἓν τῆς ἐς γῆν καὶ θάλασσαν ἀρχῆς ἀπορεῖν ἂν αὐτὸν οἷς τοὺς κρατοῦντας ξυγκαθαιρήσει , ἢν μὴ αὐτὸς βούληται μεγάλῃ δαπάνῃ καὶ κινδύνῳ ἀναστάς ποτε διαγωνίσασθαι .
" If, on the contrary, the command both by land and sea were united, he would be at a loss for any party to assist in overthrowing the stronger;


8.46.2
5655
εὐτελέστερα δὲ τάδ’ εἶναι , βραχεῖ μορίῳ τῆς δαπάνης καὶ ἅμα μετὰ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ ἀσφαλείας αὐτοὺς περὶ ἑαυτοὺς τοὺς Ἕλληνας κατατρῖψαι .
unless he should himself ever choose to arise and carry out the contest with them at a great expense and hazard. It was a cheaper risk to wear down the Greeks against each other, at a trifling share of the expense, and at the same time with security to himself."


8.46.3
5656
ἐπιτηδειοτέρους τε ἔφη τοὺς Ἀθηναίους εἶναι κοινωνοὺς αὐτῷ τῆς ἀρχῆς ·
" And the Athenians, he said, were a more desirable people to share the empire with him;


8.46.3
5657
ἧσσον γὰρ τῶν κατὰ γῆν ἐφίεσθαι , τὸν λόγον τε ξυμφορώτατον καὶ τὸ ἔργον ἔχοντας πολεμεῖν ·
for they were less desirous of possessions on shore, and carried on the war with both a profession and a practice most advantageous to him;


8.46.3
5658
τοὺς μὲν γὰρ ξυγκαταδουλοῦν ἂν σφίσι τε αὐτοῖς τὸ τῆς θαλάσσης μέρος καὶ ἐκείνῳ ὅσοι ἐν τῇ βασιλέως Ἕλληνες οἰκοῦσι , τοὺς δὲ τ- ἐναντίον ἐλευθερώσοντας ἥκειν , καὶ οὐκ εἰκὸς εἶναι Λακεδαιμονίους ἀπὸ μὲν σφῶν τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐλευθεροῦν νῦν τοὺς Ἕλληνας , ἀπὸ δ’ ἐκείνων τῶν βαρβάρων , ἢν μή ποτε αὐτοὺς μὴ ἐξέλωσι , μὴ ἐλευθερῶσαι .
as they would unite with him in subjugating, as far as the sea was concerned, to themselves and to him all the Greeks who lived in the king's country; while the other party, on the contrary, had come to liberate them. Nor was it likely that the Lacedaemonians should at the present time be liberating the Greeks from men of their own Grecian race, and should omit to liberate them from those who were barbarians; unless they should ever fail in reducing the Athenians."


8.46.4
5659
τρίβειν οὖν ἐκέλευε πρῶτον ἀμφοτέρους , καὶ ἀποτεμόμενον ὡς μέγιστα ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἔπειτ’ ἤδη τοὺς Πελοποννησίους ἀπαλλάξαι ἐκ τῆς χώρας .
" He urged them therefore to wear them both out at first, and after cutting off as much as possible from the power of the Athenians, then to get rid of the Peloponnesians from his country."


8.46.5
5660
καὶ διενοεῖτο τὸ πλέον οὕτως ὁ Τισσαφέρνης , ὅσα γε ἀπὸ τῶν ποιουμένων ἦν εἰκάσαι .
Tissaphernes adopted these views in the main, so far at least as might be conjectured from his actions.


8.46.5
5661
τῷ γὰρ Ἀλκιβιάδῃ διὰ ταῦτα ὡς εὖ περὶ τούτων παραινοῦντι προσθεὶς ἑαυτὸν ἐς πίστιν τήν τε τροφὴν κακῶς ἐπόριζε τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις καὶ ναυμαχεῖν οὐκ εἴα , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς Φοινίσσας φάσκων ναῦς ἥξειν καὶ ἐκ περιόντος ἀγωνιεῖσθαι ἔφθειρε τὰ πράγματα καὶ τὴν ἀκμὴν τοῦ ναυτικοῦ αὐτῶν ἀφείλετο γενομένην καὶ πάνυ ἰσχυράν , τά τε ἄλλα καταφανέστερον ἢ ὥστε λανθάνειν οὐ προθύμως ξυνεπολέμει .
For having on this account placed himself in the confidence of Alcibiades, as of one who had given him good advice on the subject, he both scantily supplied the Peloponnesians with money, and would not allow them to fight by sea; but by telling them that the Phoenician fleet should come to them, and that so they should contend with superabundant strength, he greatly injured their cause, and took off the vigour of their navy, which had been very great; and in all other respects, too evidently to escape observation, he wanted hearty zeal in cooperating with them.


8.47.1
5662
ὁ δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδης ταῦτα ἅμα μὲν τῷ Τισσαφέρνει καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ , ὢν παρ’ ἐκείνοις , ἄριστα εἶναι νομίζων παρῄνει , ἅμα δὲ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ κάθοδον ἐς τὴν πατρίδα ἐπιθεραπεύων , εἰδώς , εἰ μὴ διαφθερεῖ αὐτήν , ὅτι ἔσται ποτὲ αὐτῷ πείσαντι κατελθεῖν ·
Alcibiades gave this advice to Tissaphernes and the king, whilst he was with them, both because he thought it best for them,


8.47.1
5663
πεῖσαι δ’ ἂν ἐνόμιζε μάλιστα ἐκ τοῦ τοιούτου , εἰ Τισσαφέρνης φαίνοιτο αὐτῷ ἐπιτήδειος ὤν ·
and, at the same time, because he was further providing for his own restoration to his country; knowing that if he did not bring it to ruin, he would some time or other have means of persuading his countrymen, and returning to it.


8.47.1
5664
ὅπερ καὶ ἐγένετο .
But the way in which he thought he should persuade them most easily was this, namely, by Tissaphernes' appearing to be in his interest.


8.47.2
5665
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ᾔσθοντο αὐτὸν ἰσχύοντα παρ’ αὐτῷ οἱ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ Ἀθηναίων στρατιῶται , τὰ μὲν καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδου προσπέμψαντος λόγους ἐς τοὺς δυνατωτάτους αὐτῶν ἄνδρας ὥστε μνησθῆναι περὶ αὐτοῦ ἐς τοὺς βελτίστους τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὅτι ἐπ’ ὀλιγαρχίᾳ βούλεται καὶ οὐ πονηρίᾳ οὐδὲ δημοκρατίᾳ τῇ αὐτὸν ἐκβαλούσῃ κατελθὼν καὶ παρασχὼν Τισσαφέρνην φίλον αὐτοῖς ξυμπολιτεύειν , τὸ δὲ πλέον καὶ ἀπὸ σφῶν αὐτῶν οἱ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ τριήραρχοί τε τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ δυνατώτατοι ὥρμηντο ἐς τὸ καταλῦσαι τὴν δημοκρατίαν .
And so it turned out; for when the Athenian soldiers at Samos found that he had great influence with him, [the plan was adopted,] to a certain extent, in consequence of Alcibiades having sent word to the most powerful individuals amongst them, to let it be mentioned to the most respectable people, that he wished to return home on condition of there being an oligarchy, and not that unprincipled democracy which had banished him; and after making Tissaphernes their friend, to enjoy his privileges as a citizen with them: but, at the same time, the trierarchs and the most influential Athenians at Samos were of themselves still more eager for abolishing the democracy.


8.48.1
5666
καὶ ἐκινήθη πρότερον ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ τοῦτο καὶ ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἐντεῦθεν ὕστερον ἦλθεν .
This design therefore was first mooted in the camp, and thence spread to the city.


8.48.1
5667
τῷ τε Ἀλκιβιάδῃ διαβάντες τινὲς ἐκ τῆς Σάμου ἐς λόγους ἦλθον , καὶ ὑποτείνοντος αὐτοῦ Τισσαφέρνην μὲν πρῶτον , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ βασιλέα φίλον ποιήσειν , εἰ μὴ δημοκρατοῖντο ( οὕτω γὰρ ἂν πιστεῦσαι μᾶλλον βασιλέα ) , πολλὰς ἐλπίδας εἶχον αὐτοί θ’ ἑαυτοῖς οἱ δυνατώτατοι τῶν πολιτῶν τὰ πράγματα , οἵπερ καὶ ταλαιπωροῦνται μάλιστα , ἐς ἑαυτοὺς περιποιήσειν καὶ τῶν πολεμίων ἐπικρατήσειν .
Accordingly, certain individuals went over from Samos, and had an interview with Alcibiades; and when he held out that he would first make Tissaphernes their friend, and then the king, in case they were not under a democratical government, (for so the king would place greater reliance on them,) the aristocratical party amongst the citizens, who also suffered most at present, entertained many hopes of getting the government into their own hands, as well as of gaining the victory over the enemy.


8.48.2
5668
ἔς τε τὴν Σάμον ἐλθόντες ξυνίστασάν τε τῶν ἀνθρώπων τοὺς ἐπιτηδείους ἐς ξυνωμοσίαν καὶ ἐς τοὺς πολλοὺς φανερῶς ἔλεγον ὅτι βασιλεὺς σφίσι φίλος ἔσοιτο καὶ χρήματα παρέξοι Ἀλκιβιάδου τε κατελθόντος καὶ μὴ δημοκρατουμένων .
Accordingly they went to Samos, and united in a club such men as favoured their views, openly representing to the people at large that the king would be their friend, and supply them with money, if Alcibiades were restored, and they were not governed by a democracy.


8.48.3
5669
καὶ ὁ μὲν ὄχλος , εἰ καί τι παραυτίκα ἤχθετο τοῖς πρασσομένοις , διὰ τὸ εὔπορον τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ παρὰ βασιλέως μισθοῦ ἡσύχαζεν ·
The multitude, though annoyed to a certain extent by these negotiations, remained quiet because of their abundant hopes of pay from the king;


8.48.3
5670
οἱ δὲ ξυνιστάντες τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν , ἐπειδὴ τῷ πλήθει ἐκοίνωσαν , αὖθις κ- ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῦ ἑταιρικοῦ τῷ πλέονι τὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἐσκόπουν .
while those who were for establishing the oligarchy, after they had communicated their designs to the mass of the people, again considered the proposals of Alcibiades amongst themselves and the greater part of their associates.


8.48.4
5671
καὶ τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ἐφαίνετο εὔπορα καὶ πιστά , Φρυνίχῳ δὲ στρατηγῷ ἔτι ὄντι οὐδὲν ἤρεσκεν , ἀλλ’ ὅ τε Ἀλκιβιάδης , ὅπερ καὶ ἦν , οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ὀλιγαρχίας ἢ δημοκρατίας δεῖσθαι ἐδόκει αὐτῷ οὐδ’ ἄλλο τι σκοπεῖσθαι ἢ ὅτῳ τρόπῳ ἐκ τοῦ παρόντος κόσμου τὴν πόλιν μεταστήσας ὑπὸ τῶν ἑταίρων παρακληθεὶς κάτεισι , σφίσι δὲ περιοπτέον εἶναι τοῦτο μάλιστα , ὅπως μὴ στασιάσωσιν ·
To the rest, then, they appeared advantageous and worthy of their confidence;


8.48.4
5672
τῷ βασιλεῖ τε οὐκ εὔπορον εἶναι καὶ Πελοποννησίων ἤδη ὁμοίως ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ὄντων καὶ πόλεις ἐχόντων ἐν τῇ αὐτοῦ ἀρχῇ οὐ τὰς ἐλαχίστας , Ἀθηναίοις προσθέμενον , οἷς οὐ πιστεύει , πράγματα ἔχειν , ἐξὸν Πελοποννησίους , ὑφ’ ὧν κακὸν οὐδέν πω πέπονθε , φίλους ποιήσασθαι .
but Phrynichus, who was still general, was not at all pleased with them, but thought that Alcibiades (as was really the case) had no more desire for an oligarchy than for a democracy, or considered any thing else but how, by bringing the state to change its present constitution, he might obtain his recall by the invitation of his associates. " What they themselves, however, should most especially look to, was,"  he said, " to avoid being rent by factions. That it was not for the king's advantage, when the Peloponnesians were now on an equality at sea, and held none of the least cities in his dominion, to incur trouble by siding with the Athenians, whom he did not trust, when he might have made the Peloponnesians his friends, by whom he had never yet been injured."


8.48.5
5673
τάς τε ξυμμαχίδας πόλεις , αἷς ὑπεσχῆσθαι δὴ σφᾶς ὀλιγαρχίαν , ὅτι δὴ καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐ δημοκρατήσονται , εὖ εἰδέναι ἔφη ὅτι οὐδὲν μᾶλλον σφίσιν οὔθ’ αἱ ἀφεστηκυῖαι προσχωρήσονται οὔθ’ αἱ ὑπάρχουσαι βεβαιότεραι ἔσονται ·
" As for the allied states, again, to whom, forsooth, they had promised an oligarchy, because they themselves also would cease to be under a democracy, he well knew that neither those which had revolted would any the more on that account come over to them, nor those that were left be more staunch to them;


8.48.5
5674
οὐ γὰρ βουλήσεσθαι αὐτοὺς μετ’ ὀλιγαρχίας ἢ δημοκρατίας δουλεύειν μᾶλλον ἢ μεθ’ ὁποτέρου ἂν τύχωσι τούτων ἐλευθέρους εἶναι ·
for they would not wish to be slaves with either an oligarchy or a democracy, rather than to be free, under whichever of those two forms of government they might obtain their liberty."


8.48.6
5675
τούς τε καλοὺς κ- ἀγαθοὺς ὀνομαζομένους οὐκ ἐλάσσω αὐτοὺς νομίζειν σφίσι πράγματα παρέξειν τοῦ δήμου , ποριστὰς ὄντας καὶ ἐσηγητὰς τῶν κακῶν τῷ δήμῳ , ἐξ ὧν τὰ πλείω αὐτοὺς ὠφελεῖσθαι ·
" And with regard to the respectable classes, as they were called, they considered that the oligarchs would not cause them less trouble than the popular government, being as they were the authors and introducers of projects which were evil for the people, and from which they themselves derived most benefit.


8.48.6
5676
καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐπ’ ἐκείνοις εἶναι καὶ ἄκριτοι ἂν καὶ βιαιότερον ἀποθνῄσκειν , τὸν δὲ δῆμον σφῶν τε καταφυγὴν εἶναι καὶ ἐκείνων σωφρονιστήν .
Indeed as far as depended on they would be put to death without trial, and even by measures of violence; whereas the commons were their refuge, and the moderators of the other party."


8.48.7
5677
καὶ ταῦτα παρ’ αὐτῶν τῶν ἔργων ἐπισταμένας τὰς πόλεις σαφῶς αὐτὸς εἰδέναι ὅτι οὕτω νομίζουσιν .
" And as the states had learnt these things from positive facts, he well knew that such was their opinion on the subject.


8.48.7
5678
οὔκουν ἑαυτῷ γε τῶν ἀπ’ Ἀλκιβιάδου καὶ ἐν τῷ παρόντι πρασσομένων ἀρέσκειν οὐδέν .
For himself, then, he was pleased with none of the schemes carried on by Alcibiades at present, as before."


8.49.1
5679
οἱ δὲ ξυλλεγέντες τῶν ἐν τῇ ξυνωμοσίᾳ , ὥσπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον αὐτοῖς ἐδόκει , τά τε παρόντα ἐδέχοντο καὶ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας πρέσβεις Πείσανδρον καὶ ἄλλους παρεσκευάζοντο πέμπειν , ὅπως περί τε τῆς τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου καθόδου πράσσοιεν καὶ τῆς τοῦ ἐκεῖ δήμου καταλύσεως καὶ τὸν Τισσαφέρνην φίλον τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ποιήσειαν .
But those members of the association who had assembled acceded to the present proposals, as they had at first determined, and prepared to send Pisander and some others on an embassy to Athens, to treat for the return of Alcibiades and the abolition of the democracy in that city, and so to gain the friendship of Tissaphernes for the Athenians.


8.50.1
5680
γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Φρύνιχος ὅτι ἔσοιτο περὶ τῆς τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου καθόδου λόγος καὶ ὅτι Ἀθηναῖοι ἐνδέξονται αὐτήν , δείσας πρὸς τὴν ἐναντίωσιν τῶν ὑφ’ αὑτοῦ λεχθέντων μή , ἢν κατέλθῃ , ὡς κωλυτὴν ὄντα κακῶς δρᾷ , τρέπεται ἐπὶ τοιόνδε τι .
But when Phrynichus saw that there would be a proposal for the recall of Alcibiades, and that the Athenians would accede to it, being afraid, on considering the opposite tendency of what had been maintained by himself, that if he were restored he would do him some mischief, as one who had impeded his plans, he had recourse to the following device.


8.50.2
5681
πέμπει ὡς τὸν Ἀστύοχον τὸν Λακεδαιμονίων ναύαρχον ἔτι ὄντα τότε περὶ τὴν Μίλητον κρύφα ἐπιστείλας ὅτι Ἀλκιβιάδης αὐτῶν τὰ πράγματα φθείρει Τισσαφέρνην Ἀθηναίοις φίλον ποιῶν , καὶ τ- ἄλλα πάντα σαφῶς ἐγγράψας ·
He sent to Astyochus the Lacedaemonian admiral, who was still in the neighbourhood of Miletus, with secret instructions that Alcibiades was ruining their cause by bringing Tissaphernes into friendship with the Athenians; expressly mentioning all the other matters also, and pleading that it was pardonable in him to devise evil against a man who was an enemy, even though it were to the detriment of the state.


8.50.2
5682
ξυγγνώμην δὲ εἶναι ἑαυτῷ περὶ ἀνδρὸς πολεμίου καὶ μετὰ τοῦ τῆς πόλεως ἀξυμφόρου κακόν τι βουλεύειν .
and pleading that it was pardonable in him to devise evil against a man who was an enemy, even though it were to the detriment of the state.


8.50.3
5683
ὁ δὲ Ἀστύοχος τὸν μὲν Ἀλκιβιάδην ἄλλως τε καὶ οὐκέτι ὁμοίως ἐς χεῖρας ἰόντα οὐδὲ διενοεῖτο τιμωρεῖσθαι , ἀνελθὼν δὲ παρ’ αὐτὸν ἐς Μαγνησίαν καὶ παρὰ Τισσαφέρνην ἅμα λέγει τε αὐτοῖς τὰ ἐπισταλέντα ἐκ τῆς Σάμου καὶ γίγνεται αὐτὸς μηνυτής , προσέθηκέ τε , ὡς ἐλέγετο , ἐπὶ ἰδίοις κέρδεσι Τισσαφέρνει ἑαυτὸν καὶ περὶ τούτων καὶ περὶ τῶν ἄλλων κοινοῦσθαι ·
Now Astyochus did not so much as think of punishing Alcibiades—especially as he no longer put himself in his power as he used to do—but having gone up to him and Tissaphernes at Magnesia, at once told them the contents of the letter from Samos, acting as an informer to them, and for his own private gain devoting himself, as was said, to the interest of Tissaphernes both on these and on all other matters:


8.50.3
5684
διόπερ καὶ περὶ τῆς μισθοφορᾶς οὐκ ἐντελοῦς οὔσης μαλακωτέρως ἀνθήπτετο .
and for his own private gain devoting himself, as was said, to the interest of Tissaphernes both on these and on all other matters:


8.50.4
5685
ὁ δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδης εὐθὺς πέμπει κατὰ Φρυνίχου γράμματα ἐς τὴν Σάμον πρὸς τοὺς ἐν τέλει ὄντας οἷα δέδρακε , καὶ ἀξιῶν αὐτὸν ἀποθνῄσκειν .
for which reason also he was the more gentle in remonstrating with him respecting the pay not being given in full.


8.50.5
5686
θορυβούμενος δὲ ὁ Φρύνιχος καὶ πάνυ ἐν τῷ μεγίστῳ κινδύνῳ ὢν διὰ τὸ μήνυμα ἀποστέλλει αὖθις πρὸς τὸν Ἀστύοχον , τά τε πρότερα μεμφόμενος ὅτι οὐ καλῶς ἐκρύφθη καὶ νῦν ὅτι ὅλον τὸ στράτευμα τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἑτοῖμος εἴη τὸ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ παρασχεῖν αὐτοῖς διαφθεῖραι , γράψας καθ’ ἕκαστα , ἀτειχίστου οὔσης Σάμου , ᾧ ἂν τρόπῳ αὐτὰ πράξειε , καὶ ὅτι ἀνεπίφθονόν οἱ ἤδη εἴη περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς δι’ ἐκείνους κινδυνεύοντι καὶ τοῦτο καὶ ἄλλο πᾶν δρᾶσαι μᾶλλον ἢ ὑπὸ τῶν ἐχθίστων αὐτὸν διαφθαρῆναι .
Alcibiades immediately sent a letter to Samos giving information against Phrynichus to the authorities there, telling them what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death.


8.50.5
5687
ὁ δὲ Ἀστύοχος μηνύει καὶ ταῦτα τῷ Ἀλκιβιάδῃ .
Phrynichus, being confounded and in the most extreme danger, sent again to Astyochus, reproaching him because his former information had not been duly kept secret, and telling him now that he was prepared to give them an opportunity of destroying the whole Athenian armament at Samos; describing the particulars of the way in which he could do it, as Samos was unfortified; and pleading that it was not now culpable in him, being, as he was, in danger of his life through them, to do this, or any thing else, rather than be destroyed by his bitterest enemies. Astyochus gave information of this also to Alcibiades.


8.51.1
5688
καὶ ὡς προῄσθετο αὐτὸν ὁ Φρύνιχος ἀδικοῦντα καὶ ὅσον οὐ παροῦσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου περὶ τούτων ἐπιστολήν , αὐτὸς προφθάσας τῷ στρατεύματι ἐξάγγελος γίγνεται ὡς οἱ πολέμιοι μέλλουσιν ἀτειχίστου οὔσης τῆς Σάμου καὶ ἅμα τῶν νεῶν οὐ πασῶν ἔνδον ὁρμουσῶν ἐπιθήσεσθαι τῷ στρατοπέδῳ , καὶ ταῦτα σαφῶς πεπυσμένος εἴη , καὶ χρῆναι τειχίζειν τε Σάμον ὡς τάχιστα καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐν φυλακῇ ἔχειν ·
Now when Phrynichus had discovered beforehand that he was doing him injury, and that a letter from Alcibiades on the subject was on the point of arriving, he himself anticipated it by announcing to the army, that as Samos was unfortified, and all the ships were not stationed within the harbour, the enemy intended to attack the camp:


8.51.1
5689
ἐστρατήγει δὲ καὶ κύριος ἦν αὐτὸς πράσσων ταῦτα .
that he had certain intelligence of this, and that they ought as quickly as possible to fortify Samos and put every thing else in a state of defence. Now he was himself general, and so had full authority to carry out these measures. Accordingly they prepared for the work of fortification;


8.51.2
5690
καὶ οἱ μὲν τὸν τειχισμόν τε παρεσκευάζοντο καὶ ἐκ τοῦ τοιούτου , καὶ ὣς μέλλουσα , Σάμος θᾶσσον ἐτειχίσθη ·
and owing to this Samos was the more quickly walled, though it would have been so under any circumstances.


8.51.2
5691
αἱ δὲ παρὰ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἐπιστολαὶ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ἧκον ὅτι προδίδοταί τε τὸ στράτευμα ὑπὸ Φρυνίχου καὶ οἱ πολέμιοι μέλλουσιν ἐπιθήσεσθαι .
Not long after came the letters from Alcibiades, saying that the army was going to be betrayed by Phrynichus, and that the enemy were on the point of attacking them.


8.51.3
5692
δόξας δὲ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης οὐ πιστὸς εἶναι , ἀλλὰ τὰ ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων προειδὼς τῷ Φρυνίχῳ ὡς ξυνειδότι κατ’ ἔχθραν ἀνατιθέναι , οὐδὲν ἔβλαψεν αὐτόν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ξυνεμαρτύρησε μᾶλλον τ- αὐτὰ ἐσαγγείλας .
As, however, Alcibiades was not thought to be worthy of credit, but to have had a previous acquaintance with the plans of the enemy, and through personal dislike to have attributed them to Phrynichus, as though he were privy to them, he did him no harm, but rather bore witness to his statement by sending this intelligence.


8.52.1
5693
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο Ἀλκιβιάδης μὲν Τισσαφέρνην παρεσκεύαζε καὶ ἀνέπειθεν ὅπως φίλος ἔσται τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις , δεδιότα μὲν τοὺς Πελοποννησίους , ὅτι πλέοσι ναυσὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων παρῆσαν , βουλόμενον δὲ ὅμως , εἰ δύναιτό πως , πεισθῆναι , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐπειδὴ τὴν ἐν τῇ Κνίδῳ διαφορὰν περὶ τῶν Θηριμένους σπονδῶν ᾔσθετο τῶν Πελοποννησίων ( ἤδη γὰρ κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν καιρὸν ἐν τῇ Ῥόδῳ ὄντων αὐτῶν ἐγεγένητο ) ·
After this, Alcibiades tried to bring over and persuade Tissaphernes to the friendship of the Athenians; and he, though afraid of the Peloponnesians, because they were there with more ships than the Athenians, was still disposed to be convinced by him, if by any means he could; especially since he had observed the dissatisfaction of the Peloponnesians which had been expressed at Cnidus about the treaty of Theramenes,


8.52.1
5694
ἐν ᾗ τὸν τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου λόγον πρότερον εἰρημένον περὶ τοῦ ἐλευθεροῦν τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους τὰς ἁπάσας πόλεις ἐπηλήθευσεν ὁ Λίχας , οὐ φάσκων ἀνεκτὸν εἶναι ξυγκεῖσθαι κρατεῖν βασιλέα τῶν πόλεων ὧν ποτὲ καὶ πρότερον ἢ αὐτὸς ἢ οἱ πατέρες ἦρχον .
(for as at this time they were at Rhodes, it had already occurred,) in the course of which Lichas had verified the observation which had before been made by Alcibiades about the Lacedaemonians liberating all the states, when he said that it was an intolerable agreement that the king should be master of the cities over which, at any earlier period, either himself or his fathers had had dominion.


8.52.1
5695
καὶ ὁ μὲν Ἀλκιβιάδης , ἅτε περὶ μεγάλων ἀγωνιζόμενος , προθύμως τὸν Τισσαφέρνην θεραπεύων προσέκειτο ·
Alcibiades then, inasmuch as he was struggling for a great object, was earnestly courting and soliciting Tissaphernes.


8.53.1
5696
οἱ δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Πεισάνδρου πρέσβεις τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀποσταλέντες ἐκ τῆς Σάμου ἀφικόμενοι ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας λόγους ἐποιοῦντο ἐν τῷ δήμῳ κεφαλαιοῦντες ἐκ πολλῶν , μάλιστα δὲ ὡς ἐξείη αὐτοῖς Ἀλκιβιάδην καταγαγοῦσι καὶ μὴ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον δημοκρατουμένοις βασιλέα τε ξύμμαχον ἔχειν καὶ Πελοποννησίων περιγενέσθαι .
The Athenian ambassadors, on the other hand, who had been sent from Samos with Pisander, on their arrival at Athens, delivered an address before the people, giving a summary of many arguments, but most especially urging, that by recalling Alcibiades, and not being under a democratical government in the same manner as hitherto, they might both have the king for an ally, and gain the victory over the Peloponnesians.


8.53.2
5697
ἀντιλεγόντων δὲ πολλῶν καὶ ἄλλων περὶ τῆς δημοκρατίας καὶ τῶν Ἀλκιβιάδου ἅμα ἐχθρῶν διαβοώντων ὡς δεινὸν εἴη εἰ τοὺς νόμους βιασάμενος κάτεισι , καὶ Εὐμολπιδῶν καὶ Κηρύκων περὶ τῶν μυστικῶν δι’ ἅπερ ἔφυγε μαρτυρομένων καὶ ἐπιθειαζόντων μὴ κατάγειν , ὁ Πείσανδρος παρελθὼν πρὸς πολλὴν ἀντιλογίαν καὶ σχετλιασμὸν ἠρώτα ἕνα ἕκαστον παράγων τῶν ἀντιλεγόντων , εἴ τινα ἐλπίδα ἔχει σωτηρίας τῇ πόλει , Πελοποννησίων ναῦς τε οὐκ ἐλάσσους σφῶν ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἀντιπρῴρους ἐχόντων καὶ πόλεις ξυμμαχίδας πλείους , βασιλέως τε αὐτοῖς καὶ Τισσαφέρνους χρήματα παρεχόντων , σφίσι τε οὐκέτι ὄντων , εἰ μή τις πείσει βασιλέα μεταστῆναι παρὰ σφᾶς .
When many others opposed them on the subject of the democracy, and the enemies of Alcibiades at the same time exclaimed, that it was a shameful thing if he were to return by doing violence to the laws; and the Eumolpidae and Ceryces adjured them with regard to the mysteries, for which he had been banished, and appealed to the gods against their restoring him; Pisander came forward in the face of much opposition and indignant protesting, and taking aside each one of his opponents, asked him whether he had any hope of preservation for the state, since the Peloponnesians had no fewer ships than themselves opposed to them on the sea, and more cities in alliance with them, while the king and Tissaphernes supplied them with money; whereas they themselves had no longer any, unless some one should persuade the king to come over to their side.


8.53.3
5698
ὁπότε δὲ μὴ φαῖεν ἐρωτώμενοι , ἐνταῦθα δὴ σαφῶς ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς ὅτι &quot; τοῦτο τοίνυν οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμῖν γενέσθαι , εἰ μὴ πολιτεύσομεν τε σωφρονέστερον καὶ ἐς ὀλίγους μᾶλλον τὰς ἀρχὰς ποιήσομεν , ἵνα πιστεύῃ ἡμῖν βασιλεύς , καὶ μὴ περὶ πολιτείας τὸ πλέον βουλεύσομεν ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἢ περὶ σωτηρίας ( ὕστερον γὰρ ἐξέσται ἡμῖν καὶ μεταθέσθαι , ἢν μή τι ἀρέσκῃ , Ἀλκιβιάδην τε κατάξομεν , ὃς μόνος τῶν νῦν οἷός τε τοῦτο κατεργάσασθαι &quot; .
When, on being thus questioned, they allowed that they had not, he then said to them plainly, " This advantage, then, cannot be attained by us, if we do not adopt a more temperate policy, and put the offices into the hands of a smaller number, that the king may place confidence in us— (and that we may not consult so much at present about a form of government as about the preservation of the state; for we shall have power to alter hereafter whatever may not please us)—and, moreover, if we do not restore Alcibiades, who is the only man at present that can effect this."


8.54.1
5699
ὁ δὲ δῆμος τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἀκούων χαλεπῶς ἔφερε τὸ περὶ τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας ·
The people were at first very indignant on hearing mention made of the oligarchy;


8.54.1
5700
σαφῶς δὲ διδασκόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ Πεισάνδρου μὴ εἶναι ἄλλην σωτηρίαν , δείσας καὶ ἅμα ἐπελπίζων ὡς καὶ μεταβαλεῖται , ἐνέδωκεν .
but when plainly informed by Pisander that there were no other means of preservation, being afraid, and at the same time having hopes of changing it again, they gave way.


8.54.2
5701
καὶ ἐψηφίσαντο πλεύσαντα τὸν Πείσανδρον καὶ δέκα ἄνδρας μετ’ αὐτοῦ πράσσειν ὅπῃ ἂν αὐτοῖς δοκοίη ἄριστα ἕξειν τά τε πρὸς τὸν Τισσαφέρνην καὶ τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην .
Accordingly they resolved that Pisander and ten commissioners with him should sail and conclude, as they might think would be best, the negotiations both with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.


8.54.3
5702
ἅμα τε διαβαλόντος καὶ Φρύνιχον τοῦ Πεισάνδρου παρέλυσεν ὁ δῆμος τῆς ἀρχῆς καὶ τὸν ξυνάρχοντα Σκιρωνίδην , ἀντέπεμψαν δὲ στρατηγοὺς ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς Διομέδοντα καὶ Λέοντα .
At the same time, on Pisander's falsely accusing Phrynichus, the people deposed him from his command with his colleague Scironides, and sent Diomedon and Leon to the fleet as generals in their stead.


8.54.3
5703
τὸν δὲ Φρύνιχον ὁ Πείσανδρος φάσκων Ἴασον προδοῦναι καὶ Ἀμόργην διέβαλεν , οὐ νομίζων ἐπιτήδειον εἶναι τοῖς πρὸς τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην πρασσομένοις .
For Pisander calumniated Phrynichus by saying that he had betrayed Iasus and Amorges, only because he did not think him favourable to the negotiations carried on with Alcibiades.

καὶ ὁ μὲν Πείσανδρος τάς τε ξυνωμοσίας , αἵπερ ἐτύγχανον πρότερον ἐν τῇ πόλει οὖσαι ἐπὶ δίκαις καὶ ἀρχαῖς , ἁπάσας ἐπελθὼν καὶ παρακελευσάμενος ὅπως ξυστραφέντες καὶ κοινῇ βουλευσάμενοι καταλύσουσι τὸν δῆμον , καὶ τ- ἄλλα παρασκευάσας ἐπὶ τοῖς παροῦσιν ὥστε μηκέτι διαμέλλεσθαι , αὐτὸς μετὰ τῶν δέκα ἀνδρῶν τὸν πλοῦν ὡς τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ποιεῖται .
Pisander likewise visited all the clubs which had previously existed in the city for mutual support in law-suits and elections to offices, and exhorted them to unite together and by common counsels abolish the democracy; and after making all his other preparations to suit the present state of affairs, so that there might be no more delay, he himself with the ten commissioners proceeded on his voyage to Tissaphernes.


8.55.1
5705
ὁ δὲ Λέων καὶ ὁ Διομέδων ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ χειμῶνι ἀφιγμένοι ἤδη ἐπὶ τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ναῦς ἐπίπλουν τῇ Ῥόδῳ ἐποιήσαντο .
In the course of this winter Leon and Diomedon, having by this time reached the Athenian fleet, made an attack upon Rhodes.


8.55.1
5706
καὶ τὰς μὲν ναῦς καταλαμβάνουσιν ἀνειλκυσμένας τῶν Πελοποννησίων , ἐς δὲ τὴν γῆν ἀπόβασίν τινα ποιησάμενοι καὶ τοὺς προσβοηθήσαντας Ῥοδίων νικήσαντες μάχῃ ἀπεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν Χάλκην , καὶ τὸν πόλεμον ἐντεῦθεν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐκ τῆς Κῶ ἐποιοῦντο ·
The ships of the Peloponnesians they found hauled up; and having made a descent on the territory, and defeated in an engagement those of the Rhodians who went out against them, they withdrew to Chalce, and carried on the war from that place, rather than from Cos;


8.55.1
5707
εὐφυλακτότερα γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἐγίγνετο , εἴ ποι ἀπαίροι τὸ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ναυτικόν .
for it was more convenient for their observing whether the fleet of the Peloponnesians put out in any direction.


8.55.2
5708
ἦλθε δ’ ἐς τὴν Ῥόδον καὶ Ξενοφαντίδας Λάκων παρὰ Πεδαρίτου ἐκ Χίου , λέγων ὅτι τὸ τεῖχος τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἤδη ἐπιτετέλεσται , καὶ εἰ μὴ βοηθήσουσι πάσαις ταῖς ναυσίν , ἀπολεῖται τὰ ἐν Χίῳ πράγματα .
Xenophantidas the Lacedaemonian also came to Rhodes from Pedaritus at Chios, telling them that the wall of the Athenians was now completed, and unless they succoured them with all their ships, their cause would be ruined at Chios.


8.55.2
5709
οἱ δὲ διενοοῦντο βοηθήσειν .
Accordingly they determined to relieve them.


8.55.3
5710
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ὁ Πεδάριτος αὐτός τε καὶ τὸ περὶ αὑτὸν ἐπικουρικὸν ἔχων καὶ τοὺς Χίους πανστρατιᾷ προσβαλὼν τῶν Ἀθηναίων τῷ περὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐρύματι αἱρεῖ τέ τι αὐτοῦ καὶ νεῶν τινῶν ἀνειλκυσμένων ἐκράτησεν ·
In the mean time Pedaritus, with his mercenaries and the Chians, made a general assault on the fortification round the Athenian ships, and took a part of it, and got possession of some vessels that had been drawn up on shore:


8.55.3
5711
ἐπεκβοηθησάντων δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τρεψαμένων τοὺς Χίους πρώτους νικᾶται καὶ τὸ ἄλλο τὸ περὶ τὸν Πεδάριτον , καὶ αὐτὸς ἀποθνῄσκει καὶ τῶν Χίων πολλοὶ καὶ ὅπλα ἐλήφθη πολλά .
but when the Athenians had come out to the rescue, and had routed the Chians first, the rest of the force, more immediately around Pedaritus, was defeated, he himself killed, with many of the Chians, and a great number of arms taken.


8.56.1
5712
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα οἱ μὲν Χῖοι ἔκ τε γῆς καὶ θαλάσσης ἔτι μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον ἐπολιορκοῦντο καὶ ὁ λιμὸς αὐτόθι ἦν μέγας ·
After these things the Chians were besieged still more closely than before, both by land and sea, and the famine in the place was great.


8.56.1
5713
οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Πείσανδρον Ἀθηναίων πρέσβεις ἀφικόμενοι ὡς τὸν Τισσαφέρνην λόγους ποιοῦνται περὶ τῆς ὁμολογίας .
In the mean time, the Athenian ambassadors with Pisander arrived at the court of Tissaphernes, and conferred with him respecting the convention.


8.56.2
5714
Ἀλκιβιάδης δέ ( οὐ γὰρ αὐτῷ πάνυ τὰ ἀπὸ Τισσαφέρνους βέβαια ἦν , φοβουμένου τοὺς Πελοποννησίους μᾶλλον καὶ ἔτι βουλομένου , καθάπερ καὶ ὑπ’ ἐκείνου ἐδιδάσκετο , τρίβειν ἀμφοτέρους ) τρέπεται ἐπὶ τοιόνδε εἶδος ὥστε τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ὡς μέγιστα αἰτοῦντα παρὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων μὴ ξυμβῆναι .
But as Alcibiades could not depend on the views of Tissaphernes, who was more afraid of the Peloponnesians, and wished still (as he had been instructed by him) to wear both parties out, he had recourse to the following plan, in order that Tissaphernes, by demanding the greatest possible concessions from the Athenians, might avoid coming to terms with them. Tissaphernes also, in my opinion, wished the same result, being himself led to do so by fear:


8.56.3
5715
δοκεῖ δέ μοι καὶ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης τὸ αὐτὸ βουληθῆναι , αὐτὸς μὲν διὰ τὸ δέος , ὁ δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδης , ἐπειδὴ ἑώρα ἐκεῖνον καὶ ὣς οὐ ξυμβησείοντα , δοκεῖν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐβούλετο μὴ ἀδύνατος εἶναι πεῖσαι , ἀλλ’ ὡς πεπεισμένῳ Τισσαφέρνει καὶ βουλομένῳ προσχωρῆσαι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μὴ ἱκανὰ διδόναι .
but Alcibiades, when he saw that the satrap was not, under any circumstances, desirous of making an agreement, wished the Athenians to think that he was not incapable of persuading him, but that when Tissaphernes had been persuaded, and was willing to join them, the Athenians did not concede enough to him.


8.56.4
5716
ᾔτει γὰρ τοσαῦτα ὑπερβάλλων ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης , λέγων αὐτὸς ὑπὲρ παρόντος τοῦ Τισσαφέρνους , ὥστε τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων , καίπερ ἐπὶ πολὺ ὅτι αἰτοίη ξυγχωρούντων , ὅμως αἴτιον γενέσθαι ·Ἰωνίαν τε γὰρ πᾶσαν ἠξίου δίδοσθαι καὶ αὖθις νήσους τε τὰς ἐπικειμένας καὶ ἄλλα , οἷς οὐκ ἐναντιουμένων τῶν Ἀθηναίων τέλος ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ ἤδη ξυνόδῳ , δείσας μὴ πάνυ φωραθῇ ἀδύνατος ὤν , ναῦς ἠξίου ἐᾶν βασιλέα ποιεῖσθαι καὶ παραπλεῖν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γῆν ὅπῃ ἂν καὶ ὅσαις ἂν βούληται .
For Alcibiades, speaking in person in behalf of Tissaphernes, who was also present, made such excessive demands, that the refusal of the Athenians, although for a long time they conceded whatever he asked, was still the apparent cause of their failure.


8.56.4
5717
ἐνταῦθα δὴ οὐκέτι G? ἀλλ’ ἄπορα νομίσαντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἐξηπατῆσθαι , δι’ ὀργῆς ἀπελθόντες κομίζονται ἐς τὴν Σάμον .
For they required the whole of Ionia to be given up, and then again the adjacent islands, with other things; and when the Athenians did not object to these demands, at last, in their third interview, being afraid that he would certainly be convicted of inability to keep his word, he demanded that they should permit the king to build ships, and sail along his own coast, wherever and with how many soever he might please. Upon that the Athenians complied no longer, but considering that the business was impracticable, and that they had been deceived by Alcibiades, they departed in a rage, and went to Samos.


8.57.1
5718
Τισσαφέρνης δὲ εὐθὺς μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ χειμῶνι παρέρχεται ἐς τὴν Καῦνον , βουλόμενος τοὺς Πελοποννησίους πάλιν τε κομίσαι ἐς τὴν Μίλητον καὶ ξυνθήκας ἔτι ἄλλας ποιησάμενος , ἃς ἂν δύνηται , τροφήν τε παρέχειν καὶ μὴ παντάπασιν ἐκπεπολεμῶσθαι , δεδιὼς μή , ἢν ἀπορῶσι πολλαῖς ναυσὶ τῆς τροφῆς , ἢ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἀναγκασθέντες ναυμαχεῖν ἡσσηθῶσιν ἢ κενωθεισῶν τῶν νεῶν ἄνευ ἑαυτοῦ γένηται τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἃ βούλονται .
Immediately after these things, in the very same winter, Tissaphernes proceeded to Caunus, wishing to bring the Peloponnesians back to Miletus, and after making still another convention with them, to give them pay, and not have them driven to absolute hostilities with him;


8.57.1
5719
ἔτι δὲ ἐφοβεῖτο μάλιστα μὴ τῆς τροφῆς ζητήσει πορθήσωσι τὴν ἤπειρον .
being afraid that if they were without supplies for many of their ships, they might either be compelled to engage the Athenians and be defeated, or through their vessels being unmanned the Athenians might without his assistance attain the object of their wishes. And again, he was most of all afraid that they might ravage the continent in search of supplies.


8.57.2
5720
πάντων οὖν τούτων λογισμῷ καὶ προνοίᾳ , ὥσπερ ἐβούλετο ἐπανισοῦν τοὺς Ἕλληνας πρὸς ἀλλήλους , μεταπεμψάμενος οὖν τοὺς Πελοποννησίους τροφήν τε αὐτοῖς δίδωσι καὶ σπονδὰς τρίτας τάσδε σπένδεται .
From calculating and forecasting all these things, in accordance with his wish to reduce the Greeks to a footing of equality with one another, he consequently sent for the Lacedaemonians, and gave them supplies, and concluded a third treaty with them, to the following effect:


8.58.1
5721
&quot; τρίτῳ καὶ δεκάτῳ ἔτει Δαρείου βασιλεύοντος , ἐφορεύοντος δὲ Ἀλεξιππίδα ἐν Λακεδαίμονι , ξυνθῆκαι ἐγένοντο ἐν Μαιάνδρου πεδίῳ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων πρὸς Τισσαφέρνην καὶ Ἱεραμένη καὶ τοὺς Φαρνάκου παῖδας περὶ τῶν βασιλέως πραγμάτων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων .
" In the thirteenth year of the reign of Darius, while Alexippidas was ephor at Lacedaemon, a convention was concluded on the plain of the Maeander by the Lacedaemonians and their allies, with Tissaphernes, Hieramenes, and the sons of Pharnaces, respecting the interests of the king, the Lacedaemonians, and their allies.—That the king's country, so far as it lies in Asia, shall belong to the king still;"


8.58.2
5722
χώραν τὴν βασιλέως , ὅση τῆς Ἀσίας ἐστί , βασιλέως εἶναι ·
" and that respecting his own territory, the king shall adopt such measures as he pleases.—"


8.58.2
5723
καὶ περὶ τῆς χώρας τῆς ἑαυτοῦ βουλευέτω βασιλεὺς ὅπως βούλεται .
" and that respecting his own territory, the king shall adopt such measures as he pleases.—"


8.58.3
5724
Λακεδαιμονίους δὲ καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους μὴ ἰέναι ἐπὶ χώραν τὴν βασιλέως ἐπὶ κακῷ μηδενί , μηδὲ βασιλέα ἐπὶ τὴν Λακεδαιμονίων χώραν μηδὲ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐπὶ κακῷ μηδενί .
" That the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall not invade the king's territory, nor the king that of the Lacedaemonians or their allies, to do it any harm.— That if any of the Lacedaemonians invade the king's territory to do it harm, the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall prevent it;"


8.58.4
5725
ἢν δέ τις Λακεδαιμονίων ἢ τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐπὶ κακῷ ἴῃ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλέως χώραν , Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους κωλύειν ·
" and that if any one from the king's country proceed against the Lacedaemonians or their allies to do them harm, the king shall prevent it.—"


8.58.4
5726
καὶ ἤν τις ἐκ τῆς βασιλέως ἴῃ ἐπὶ κακῷ ἐπὶ Λακεδαιμονίους ἢ τοὺς ξυμμάχους , βασιλεὺς κωλυέτω .
" and that if any one from the king's country proceed against the Lacedaemonians or their allies to do them harm, the king shall prevent it.—"


8.58.5
5727
τροφὴν δὲ ταῖς ναυσὶ ταῖς νῦν παρούσαις Τισσαφέρνην παρέχειν κατὰ τὰ ξυγκείμενα μέχρι ἂν αἱ νῆες αἱ βασιλέως ἔλθωσιν ·
" That Tissaphernes shall provide the pay for the ships now present. according to the contract, until the king's fleet has come;"


8.58.6
5728
Λακεδαιμονίους δὲ καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους , ἐπὴν αἱ βασιλέως νῆες ἀφίκωνται , τὰς ἑαυτῶν ναῦς , ἢν βούλωνται , τρέφειν ἐφ’ ἑαυτοῖς εἶναι .
" but that when the king's fleet has come, the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall be at liberty to maintain their own ships, if they wish it.


8.58.6
5729
ἢν δὲ παρὰ Τισσαφέρνους λαμβάνειν ἐθέλωσι τὴν τροφήν , Τισσαφέρνην παρέχειν , Λακεδαιμονίους δὲ καὶ τοὺς ξυμμάχους τελευτῶντος τοῦ πολέμου τὰ χρήματα Τισσαφέρνει ἀποδοῦναι ὁπόσα ἂν λάβωσιν .
That if, however, they consent to receive supplies from Tissaphernes, he shall furnish them, and the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall refund to him, at the conclusion of the war, whatever sums of money they may have received.—"


8.58.7
5730
ἐπὴν δὲ αἱ βασιλέως νῆες ἀφίκωνται , αἵ τε Λακεδαιμονίων νῆες καὶ αἱ τῶν ξυμμάχων καὶ αἱ βασιλέως κοινῇ τὸν πόλεμον πολεμούντων καθ’ ὅτι ἂν Τισσαφέρνει δοκῇ καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις .
" That after the king's ships have arrived, those of the Lacedaemonians and their allies and those of the king shall jointly carry on the war, according as Tissaphernes and the Lacedaemonians and their allies may think fit.


8.58.7
5731
ἢν δὲ καταλύειν βούλωνται πρὸς Ἀθηναίους , ἐν ὁμοίῳ καταλύεσθαι &quot; .
And if they wish to terminate hostilities with the Athenians, they shall be terminated on the same footing."


8.59.1
5732
αἱ μὲν σπονδαὶ αὗται ἐγένοντο , καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα παρεσκευάζετο Τισσαφέρνης τάς τε Φοινίσσας ναῦς ἄξων , ὥσπερ εἴρητο , καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὅσαπερ ὑπέσχετο , καὶ ἐβούλετο παρασκευαζόμενος γοῦν δῆλος εἶναι ·
This was the treaty that was made. And after this, Tissaphernes prepared to bring up the Phoenician fleet, as had been agreed, and all other things which he had promised; or, at any rate, he wished to  to be thus preparing.


8.60.1
5733
Βοιωτοὶ δὲ τελευτῶντος ἤδη τοῦ χειμῶνος Ὠρωπὸν εἷλον προδοσίᾳ , Ἀθηναίων ἐμφρουρούντων .
When the winter was now closing, the Boeotians took Oropus by treachery, while an Athenian garrison was holding it.


8.60.1
5734
ξυνέπραξαν δὲ Ἐρετριῶν τε ἄνδρες καὶ αὐτῶν Ὠρωπίων , ἐπιβουλεύοντες ἀπόστασιν τῆς Εὐβοίας ·
There co-operated with them, also, some of the Eretrians and of the Oropians themselves, who were plotting the revolt of Euboea;


8.60.1
5735
ἐπὶ γὰρ τῇ Ἐρετρίᾳ τὸ χωρίον ὂν ἀδύνατα ἦν Ἀθηναίων ἐχόντων μὴ οὐ μεγάλα βλάπτειν καὶ Ἐρέτριαν καὶ τὴν ἄλλην Εὔβοιαν .
For as the place was just opposite to Eretria, so long as the Athenians held it, it could not fail to do much damage both to Eretria and the rest of Euboea.


8.60.2
5736
ἔχοντες οὖν ἤδη τὸν Ὠρωπὸν ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς Ῥόδον οἱ Ἐρετριῆς , ἐπικαλούμενοι ἐς τὴν Εὔβοιαν τοὺς Πελοποννησίους .
Being now therefore in possession of Oropus, the Eretrians came to Rhodes, inviting the Peloponnesians into Euboea.


8.60.2
5737
οἱ δὲ πρὸς τὴν τῆς Χίου κακουμένης βοήθειαν μᾶλλον ὥρμηντο , καὶ ἄραντες πάσαις ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐκ τῆς Ῥόδου ἔπλεον .
They, however, were more disposed to relieve Chios in its distress, and so put out and sailed from Rhodes with all their fleet.


8.60.3
5738
καὶ γενόμενοι περὶ τὸ Τριόπιον καθορῶσι τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων ναῦς πελαγίας ἀπὸ τῆς Χάλκης πλεούσας ·
When they were off Triopium, they descried that of the Athenians out at sea, sailing from Chalce:


8.60.3
5739
καὶ ὡς οὐδέτεροι ἀλλήλοις ἐπέπλεον , ἀφικνοῦνται οἱ μὲν ἐς τὴν Σάμον , οἱ δὲ ἐς τὴν Μίλητον , καὶ ἑώρων οὐκέτι ἄνευ ναυμαχίας οἷόν τε εἶναι ἐς τὴν Χίον βοηθῆσαι .
and as neither side advanced against the other, they arrived, the Athenians at Samos, the Peloponnesians at Miletus, finding that it was no longer possible to go to the relief of Chios without a sea-fight.


8.60.3
5740
καὶ ὁ χειμὼν ἐτελεύτα οὗτος , καὶ εἰκοστὸν ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα τῷδε ὃν Θουκυδίδης ξυνέγραψεν .
And so the winter ended, and the twentieth year of this war of which Thucydides wrote the history.


8.61.1
5741
τοῦ δ’ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους ἅμα τῷ ἦρι εὐθὺς ἀρχομένῳ Δερκυλίδας τε ἀνὴρ Σπαρτιάτης στρατιὰν ἔχων οὐ πολλὴν παρεπέμφθη πεζῇ ἐφ’ Ἑλλησπόντου Ἄβυδον ἀποστήσων ( εἰσὶ δὲ Μιλησίων ἄποικοι ) , καὶ οἱ Χῖοι , ἐν ὅσῳ αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἀστύοχος ἠπόρει ὅπως βοηθήσοι , ναυμαχῆσαι πιεζόμενοι τῇ πολιορκίᾳ ἠναγκάσθησαν .
Immediately at the commencement of the spring of the following summer, Dercyllidas, a Spartan, was sent with a small force by land to the Hellespont, to effect the revolt of Abydus, which is a colony of the Milesians; and the Chians, while Astyochus was at a loss how to succour them, were compelled by the pressure of the siege to a naval engagement.


8.61.2
5742
ἔτυχον δὲ ἔτι ἐν Ῥόδῳ ὄντος Ἀστυόχου ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου Λέοντά τε ἄνδρα Σπαρτιάτην , ὃς Ἀντισθένει ἐπιβάτης ξυνεξῆλθε , τοῦτον κεκομισμένοι μετὰ τὸν Πεδαρίτου θάνατον ἄρχοντα καὶ ναῦς δώδεκα , αἳ ἔτυχον φύλακες Μιλήτου οὖσαι , ὧν ἦσαν Θούριαι πέντε καὶ Συρακόσιαι τέσσαρες καὶ μία Ἀναιῖτις καὶ μία Μιλησία καὶ Λέοντος μία .
They happened, while Astyochus was still at Rhodes, to have received from Miletus, as their commander after the death of Pedaritus, a Spartan named Leon, who had come out as a passenger with Antisthenes, and twelve ships which had been on guard at Miletus, five of which were Thurian, four Syracusan, one Anaean, one Milesian, and one Leon's own ship When therefore the Chians had gone out against them in full force, and had occupied a strong position, while their ships at the same time to the number of six and thirty put out to meet the two and thirty of the Athenians, they engaged them by sea;


8.61.3
5743
ἐπεξελθόντων δὲ τῶν Χίων πανδημεὶ καὶ καταλαβόντων τι ἐρυμνὸν χωρίον καὶ τῶν νεῶν αὐτοῖς ἅμα ἓξ καὶ τριάκοντα ἐπὶ τὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων δύο καὶ τριάκοντα ἀναγαγομένων ἐναυμάχησαν ·
and an obstinate battle having been fought, the Chians and their allies, who had not the worst in the action, returned (for it was now late) into their city.


8.61.3
5744
καὶ καρτερᾶς γενομένης ναυμαχίας οὐκ ἔλασσον ἔχοντες ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ οἱ Χῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ( ἤδη γὰρ καὶ ὀψὲ ἦν ) ἀνεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν πόλιν .
and an obstinate battle having been fought, the Chians and their allies, who had not the worst in the action, returned (for it was now late) into their city.


8.62.1
5745
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο εὐθὺς τοῦ Δερκυλίδου πεζῇ ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου παρεξελθόντος Ἄβυδος ἐν τῷ Ἑλλησπόντῳ ἀφίσταται πρὸς Δερκυλίδαν καὶ Φαρνάβαζον , καὶ Λάμψακος δυοῖν ἡμέραιν ὕστερον .
After this, immediately that Dercyllidas had proceeded thither by land from Miletus, Abydus on the Hellespont revolted to him and Pharnabazus, as also did Lampsacus two days later.


8.62.2
5746
Στρομβιχίδης δὲ ἐκ τῆς Χίου πυθόμενος κατὰ τάχος βοηθήσας ναυσὶν Ἀθηναίων τέσσαρσι καὶ εἴκοσιν , ὧν καὶ στρατιώτιδες ἦσαν ὁπλίτας ἄγουσαι , ἐπεξελθόντων τῶν Λαμψακηνῶν μάχῃ κρατήσας καὶ αὐτοβοεὶ Λάμψακον ἀτείχιστον οὖσαν ἑλών , καὶ σκεύη μὲν καὶ ἀνδράποδα ἁρπαγὴν ποιησάμενος , τοὺς δ’ ἐλευθέρους πάλιν κατοικίσας , ἐπ’ Ἄβυδον ἦλθεν .
When Strombichides heard of this, he went to the rescue from Chios, as quickly as possible, with four and twenty Athenian ships, some of which also were transports carrying heavy-armed troops;


8.62.3
5747
καὶ ὡς οὔτε προσεχώρουν οὔτε προσβάλλων ἐδύνατο ἑλεῖν , ἐς τὸ ἀντιπέρας τῆς Ἀβύδου ἀποπλεύσας Σηστὸν πόλιν τῆς Χερσονήσου , ἥν ποτε Μῆδοι εἶχον , καθίστατο φρούριον καὶ φυλακὴν τοῦ παντὸς Ἑλλησπόντου .
and when the Lampsacenes came out against him, having defeated them in battle, taken at the first assault their city, which was unfortified, and made spoil of implements and slaves, (though he restored the freemen to their dwellings,) he proceeded against Abydus When they did not capitulate, and he was unable to take the place by assault, he sailed away to the coast opposite Abydus, and appointed Sestus, a town of the Chersonese which the Medes had held at the time so well known, as a post for a garrison, and for the defence of the whole of the Hellespont.


8.63.1
5748
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ οἱ Χῖοί τε θαλασσοκράτορες μᾶλλον ἐγένοντο καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ καὶ ὁ Ἀστύοχος πυθόμενος τὰ περὶ τῆς ναυμαχίας καὶ τὸν Στρομβιχίδην καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἀπεληλυθότα ἐθάρσησεν .
In the mean time the Chians were masters of the sea more than they had been; and Astyochus with those at Miletus, on hearing the particulars of the naval engagement, and the departure of Strombichides with his squadron, took fresh courage.


8.63.2
5749
καὶ παραπλεύσας δυοῖν νεοῖν Ἀστύοχος ἐς Χίον κομίζει αὐτόθεν τὰς ναῦς καὶ ξυμπάσαις ἤδη ἐπίπλουν ποιεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν Σάμον ·
And so having coasted along with two ships to Chios, he took the fleet from that place, and with all his force now united advanced against Samos.


8.63.2
5750
καὶ ὡς αὐτῷ διὰ τὸ ἀλλήλοις ὑπόπτως ἔχειν οὐκ ἀντανήγοντο , ἀπέπλευσε πάλιν ἐς τὴν Μίλητον .
When the Athenians, in consequence of their being suspicious of one another, did not put out to meet him, he sailed back again to Miletus.


8.63.3
5751
ὑπὸ γὰρ τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον καὶ ἔτι πρότερον ἡ ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις δημοκρατία κατελέλυτο .
For about this time, or still earlier, democracy had been abolished at Athens.


8.63.3
5752
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ οἱ περὶ τὸν Πείσανδρον πρέσβεις παρὰ τοῦ Τισσαφέρνους ἐς τὴν Σάμον ἦλθον , τά τε ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ στρατεύματι ἔτι βεβαιότερον κατέλαβον καὶ αὐτῶν τῶν Σαμίων προυτρέψαντο τοὺς δυνατωτάτους ὥστε πειρᾶσθαι μετὰ σφῶν ὀλιγαρχηθῆναι , καίπερ ἐπαναστάντας αὐτοὺς ἀλλήλοις ἵνα μὴ ὀλιγαρχῶνται ·
For when Pisander and the ambassadors came from Tissaphernes to Samos, they both secured still more strongly their interest in the army itself, and instigated the most powerful of the Samians also to try with them to set up an oligarchy among themselves, although they had been rising up against one another to avoid an oligarchical government.


8.63.4
5753
καὶ ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἅμα οἱ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων κοινολογούμενοι ἐσκέψαντο Ἀλκιβιάδην μέν , ἐπειδήπερ οὐ βούλεται , ἐᾶν ( καὶ γὰρ οὐκ ἐπιτήδειον αὐτὸν εἶναι ἐς ὀλιγαρχίαν ἐλθεῖν ) , αὐτοὺς δὲ ἐπὶ σφῶν αὐτῶν , ὡς ἤδη καὶ κινδυνεύοντας , ὁρᾶν ὅτῳ τρόπῳ μὴ ἀνεθήσεται τὰ πράγματα , καὶ τὰ τοῦ πολέμου ἅμα ἀντέχειν καὶ ἐσφέρειν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων οἴκων προθύμως χρήματα καὶ ἤν τι ἄλλο δέῃ , ὡς οὐκέτι ἄλλοις ἢ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ταλαιπωροῦντας .
At the same time those of the Athenians at Samos determined, after communicating with each other, to give up Alcibiades, since he would not join them, (for indeed he was not a proper person, they said, to become a member of an oligarchy,) but to consider amongst themselves, since they were now actually imperilled, by what means their cause might escape abandonment; and at the same time to persevere in their measures for the war, and themselves to contribute with alacrity from their own private resources, both money and whatever else might be required, since they were no longer bearing the burden for any but themselves.


8.64.1
5754
παρακελευσάμενοι οὖν τοιαῦτα τὸν μὲν Πείσανδρον εὐθὺς τότε καὶ τῶν πρέσβεων τοὺς ἡμίσεις ἀπέστελλον ἐπ’ οἴκου πράξοντας τ- ἐκεῖ , καὶ εἴρητο αὐτοῖς τῶν ὑπηκόων πόλεων αἷς ἂν προσσχῶσιν ὀλιγαρχίαν καθιστάναι ·
Having thus exhorted one another, they then immediately sent back home Pisander and half the ambassadors, to manage matters there; with instructions also to establish oligarchy in such of the subject cities as they touched at:


8.64.1
5755
τοὺς δ’ ἡμίσεις ἐς τ- ἄλλα τὰ ὑπήκοα χωρία ἄλλους ἄλλῃ διέπεμπον , καὶ Διειτρέφη ὄντα περὶ Χίον , ᾑρημένον δὲ ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ἄρχειν , ἀπέστελλον ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχήν .
the other half they sent to the rest of the places subject to them, some in one direction and some in another.


8.64.2
5756
καὶ ἀφικόμενος ἐς τὴν Θάσον τὸν δῆμον κατέλυσεν .
They also dismissed to his government Diotrephes, who was in the neighbourhood of Chios, but had been elected to take the command of the countries Thraceward. He, on his arrival at Thasos, abolished the democratical government;


8.64.3
5757
καὶ ἀπελθόντος αὐτοῦ οἱ Θάσιοι δευτέρῳ μηνὶ μάλιστα τὴν πόλιν ἐτείχιζον , ὡς τῆς μὲν μετ’ Ἀθηναίων ἀριστοκρατίας οὐδὲν ἔτι προσδεόμενοι , τὴν δ’ ἀπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων ἐλευθερίαν ὁσημέραι προσδεχόμενοι ·
but about two months after his departure the Thasians began to fortify their city, as wanting no more aristocracy in conjunction with the Athenians, but daily looking for liberty to be given them by the Lacedaemonians.


8.64.4
5758
καὶ γὰρ καὶ φυγὴ αὐτῶν ἔξω ἦν ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων παρὰ τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις , καὶ αὕτη μετὰ τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐπιτηδείων κατὰ κράτος ἔπρασσε ναῦς τε κομίσαι καὶ τὴν Θάσον ἀποστῆσαι .
For indeed there was a party of them with the Peloponnesians which had been expelled by the Athenians, and which, in concert with their friends in the city, was exerting itself with all its might to bring a squadron, and effect the revolt of Thasos.


8.64.4
5759
ξυνέβη οὖν αὐτοῖς μάλιστα ἃ ἐβούλοντο , τὴν πόλιν τε ἀκινδύνως ὀρθοῦσθαι καὶ τὸν ἐναντιωσόμενον δῆμον καταλελύσθαι .
They had the fortune, then, to find what they most wished, namely, the city brought to the right side without any danger, and the democratical party deposed, which had been likely to prove an obstacle.


8.64.5
5760
περὶ μὲν οὖν τὴν Θάσον τ- ἐναντία τοῖς τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν καθιστᾶσι τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐγένετο , δοκεῖν δέ μοι καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις πολλοῖς τῶν ὑπηκόων ·
Thus then in the case of Thasos, and, I imagine, in that of many other of the subjects, the result was the contrary of what was expected by those of the Athenians who were establishing oligarchy;


8.64.5
5761
σωφροσύνην γὰρ λαβοῦσαι αἱ πόλεις καὶ ἄδειαν τῶν πρασσομένων ἐχώρησαν ἐπὶ τὴν ἄντικρυς ἐλευθερίαν τῆς ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὑπούλου εὐνομίας οὐ προτιμήσαντες .
for when the states had got a moderate government, and security of action, they went on to absolute liberty, and did not value the specious advantage of good laws which they received from the Athenians.


8.65.1
5762
οἱ δὲ ἀμφὶ τὸν Πείσανδρον παραπλέοντές τε , ὥσπερ ἐδέδοκτο , τοὺς δήμους ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι κατέλυον , καὶ ἅμα ἔστιν ἀφ’ ὧν χωρίων καὶ ὁπλίτας ἔχοντες σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ξυμμάχους ἦλθον ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας .
Pisander, then, and his companions, as they coasted along, abolished the popular governments in the cities, according to arrangement, and, moreover, took from some places heavy-armed troops as their allies, and so came to Athens. There they found most of the business already accomplished by their associates.


8.65.2
5763
καὶ καταλαμβάνουσι τὰ πλεῖστα τοῖς ἑταίροις προειργασμένα .
They found that most things had already been prepared by their associates.


8.65.2
5764
καὶ γὰρ Ἀνδροκλέα τέ τινα τοῦ δήμου μάλιστα προεστῶτα ξυστάντες τινὲς τῶν νεωτέρων κρύφα ἀποκτείνουσιν , ὅσπερ καὶ τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην οὐχ ἥκιστα ἐξήλασε , καὶ αὐτὸν κατ’ ἀμφότερα , τῆς τε δημαγωγίας ἕνεκα καὶ οἰόμενοι τῷ Ἀλκιβιάδῃ ὡς κατιόντι καὶ τὸν Τισσαφέρνην φίλον ποιήσοντι χαριεῖσθαι , μᾶλλόν τι διέφθειραν ·
For some of the younger men, having conspired together, secretly assassinated one Androcles, the most prominent leaders of the commons, and who also had mainly procured the banishment of Alcibiades;


8.65.2
5765
καὶ ἄλλους τινὰς ἀνεπιτηδείους τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ κρύφα ἀνήλωσαν .
and for both these reasons, on account of his being a popular leader, and because they thought they should gratify Alcibiades, who, they concluded, would be recalled, and would make Tissaphernes their friend, they were the more ready to kill him. There were some other obnoxious individuals also whom they secretly took off in the same manner.


8.65.3
5766
λόγος τε ἐκ τοῦ φανεροῦ προείργαστο αὐτοῖς ὡς οὔτε μισθοφορητέον εἴη ἄλλους ἢ τοὺς στρατευομένους οὔτε μεθεκτέον τῶν πραγμάτων πλέοσιν ἢ πεντακισχιλίοις , καὶ τούτοις οἳ ἂν μάλιστα τοῖς τε χρήμασι καὶ τοῖς σώμασιν ὠφελεῖν οἷοί τε ὦσιν .
A proposal too had already been openly set on foot by them, that no others should receive pay but such as served in the war; and that not more than five thousand should have a share in the government, and those such as were most competent to do the state service both with their property and their persons.


8.66.1
5767
ἦν δὲ τοῦτο εὐπρεπὲς πρὸς τοὺς πλείους , ἐπεὶ ἕξειν γε τὴν πόλιν οἵπερ καὶ μεθίστασαν ἔμελλον .
Now this was but a specious profession for the people at large, since the same men would really hold the government as would bring about the revolution.


8.66.1
5768
δῆμος μέντοι ὅμως ἔτι καὶ βουλὴ ἡ ἀπὸ τοῦ κυάμου ξυνελέγετο ·
The people, however, and the council of five hundred still met notwithstanding,


8.66.1
5769
ἐβούλευον δὲ οὐδὲν ὅτι μὴ τοῖς ξυνεστῶσι δοκοίη , ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ λέγοντες ἐκ τούτων ἦσαν καὶ τὰ ῥηθησόμενα πρότερον αὐτοῖς προύσκεπτο .
though they discussed nothing that was not approved of by the conspirators, but both the speakers belonged to that party, and the points to be brought forward were previously discussed by them.


8.66.2
5770
ἀντέλεγέ τε οὐδεὶς ἔτι τῶν ἄλλων , δεδιὼς καὶ ὁρῶν πολὺ τὸ ξυνεστηκός ·
Indeed no one else any longer opposed them, through fear, and from seeing that the conspiracy was extensively spread;


8.66.2
5771
εἰ δέ τις καὶ ἀντείποι , εὐθὺς ἐκ τρόπου τινὸς ἐπιτηδείου ἐτεθνήκει , καὶ τῶν δρασάντων οὔτε ζήτησις οὔτ’ εἰ ὑποπτεύοιντο δικαίωσις ἐγίγνετο , ἀλλ’ ἡσυχίαν εἶχεν ὁ δῆμος καὶ κατάπληξιν τοιαύτην ὥστε κέρδος ὁ μὴ πάσχων τι βίαιον , εἰ καὶ σιγῴη , ἐνόμιζεν .
and if any one did speak against them, he immediately came to his end in some convenient way, and there was neither any search made for those who had perpetrated the deed, nor were they brought to justice if they were suspected; but the commons remained still, and in such consternation that every one thought himself fortunate who did not meet with some violent treatment, even though he held his tongue.


8.66.3
5772
καὶ τὸ ξυνεστηκὸς πολὺ πλέον ἡγούμενοι εἶναι ἢ ὅσον ἐτύγχανεν ὂν ἡσσῶντο ταῖς γνώμαις , καὶ ἐξευρεῖν αὐτὸ ἀδύνατοι ὄντες διὰ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς πόλεως καὶ διὰ τὴν ἀλλήλων ἀγνωσίαν οὐκ εἶχον αὐτοὶ ἐξευρεῖν .
From supposing, too, that the conspiracy was much more general than it really was, they were the more faint-hearted, and were unable to ascertain its extent, being powerless in consequence of the size of the city, and their not knowing one another's views.


8.66.4
5773
κατὰ δὲ τ- αὐτὸ τοῦτο καὶ προσολοφύρασθαί τινι ἀγανακτήσαντα , ὥστε ἀμύνασθαι ἐπιβουλεύσαντα , ἀδύνατον ἦν ·
And on this same ground also it was impossible for a man to bemoan himself to another in his indignation, so as to repel one who was plotting against him;


8.66.4
5774
ἢ γὰρ ἀγνῶτα ἂν ηὗρεν ᾧ ἐρεῖ ἢ γνώριμον ἄπιστον .
since he would either have found a person he did not know, to whom to speak his mind, or one whom he knew but could not trust.


8.66.5
5775
ἀλλήλοις γὰρ ἅπαντες ὑπόπτως προσῇσαν οἱ τοῦ δήμου , ὡς μετέχοντά τινα τῶν γιγνομένων .
For all the members of the popular party approached each other with suspicion, supposing every one to have a hand in what was going on.


8.66.5
5776
ἐνῆσαν γὰρ καὶ οὓς οὐκ ἄν ποτέ τις ᾤετο ἐς ὀλιγαρχίαν τραπέσθαι ·
For there were amongst them some whom one would never have supposed likely to join an oligarchy;


8.66.5
5777
καὶ τὸ ἄπιστον οὗτοι μέγιστον πρὸς τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐποίησαν καὶ πλεῖστα ἐς τὴν τῶν ὀλίγων ἀσφάλειαν ὠφέλησαν , βέβαιον τὴν ἀπιστίαν τῷ δήμῳ πρὸς ἑαυτὸν καταστήσαντες .
and it was these that produced the greatest distrust in the many, and that contributed most to the safety of the few, by confirming the people's want of confidence in each other.


8.67.1
5778
ἐν τούτῳ οὖν τῷ καιρῷ οἱ περὶ τὸν Πείσανδρον ἐλθόντες εὐθὺς τῶν λοιπῶν εἴχοντο .
Pisander and his colleagues therefore having come at this critical time, immediately addressed themselves to the remainder of the work.


8.67.1
5779
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν τὸν δῆμον ξυλλέξαντες εἶπον γνώμην δέκα ἄνδρας ἑλέσθαι ξυγγραφέας αὐτοκράτορας , τούτους δὲ ξυγγράψαντας γνώμην ἐσενεγκεῖν ἐς τὸν δῆμον ἐς ἡμέραν ῥητὴν καθ’ ὅτι ἄριστα ἡ πόλις οἰκήσεται ·
In the first place, having assembled the people, they moved a resolution for electing ten commissioners with absolute powers for compiling laws, and that after compiling them they should lay before the people, on an appointed day, their opinion as to the manner in which the state would be best governed.


8.67.2
5780
ἔπειτα ἐπειδὴ ἡ ἡμέρα ἐφῆκε , ξυνέκλῃσαν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ἐς τὸν Κολωνόν ( ἔστι δὲ ἱερὸν Ποσειδῶνος ἔξω πόλεως ἀπέχον σταδίους μάλιστα δέκα ) , καὶ ἐσήνεγκαν οἱ ξυγγραφῆς ἄλλο μὲν οὐδέν , αὐτὸ δὲ τοῦτο , ἐξεῖναι μὲν Ἀθηναίων ἀνατεὶ εἰπεῖν γνώμην ἣν ἄν τις βούληται ·
Afterwards, when the day had arrived, they enclosed the assembly in the Colonus, (a temple of Neptune outside the city, at the distance of about ten stades,)


8.67.2
5781
ἢν δέ τις τὸν εἰπόντα ἢ γράψηται παρανόμων ἢ ἄλλῳ τῳ τρόπῳ βλάψῃ , μεγάλας ζημίας ἐπέθεσαν .
and the compilers brought forward no other motion, but simply this, that any of the Athenians should be at liberty to express any opinion he might please; and if any one either prosecuted the speaker for illegality, or otherwise injured him, they imposed upon him severe penalties.


8.67.3
5782
ἐνταῦθα δὴ λαμπρῶς ἐλέγετο ἤδη μήτε ἀρχὴν ἄρχειν μηδεμίαν ἔτι ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ κόσμου μήτε μισθοφορεῖν προέδρους τε ἑλέσθαι πέντε ἄνδρας , τούτους δὲ ἑλέσθαι ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας , καὶ τῶν ἑκατὸν ἕκαστον πρὸς ἑαυτὸν τρεῖς ·
Upon that it was at length plainly declared, that no one should any longer either hold office, or receive pay, according to the present constitution;


8.67.3
5783
ἐλθόντας δὲ αὐτοὺς τετρακοσίους ὄντας ἐς τὸ βουλευτήριον ἄρχειν ὅπῃ ἂν ἄριστα γιγνώσκωσιν αὐτοκράτορας , καὶ τοὺς πεντακισχιλίους δὲ ξυλλέγειν ὁπόταν αὐτοῖς δοκῇ .
that they should elect five men as presidents, who, again, should elect a hundred, and each of the hundred three for himself, and that these, amounting to four hundred, should enter the council-chamber, and govern as they might think best, with full powers, and should elect the five thousand also, whenever they might please.


8.68.1
5784
ἦν δὲ ὁ μὲν τὴν γνώμην ταύτην εἰπὼν Πείσανδρος , καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐκ τοῦ προφανοῦς προθυμότατα ξυγκαταλύσας τὸν δῆμον ·
Now it was Pisander who moved this resolution, and in other respects was openly the most forward in assisting to put down the democracy.


8.68.1
5785
ὁ μέντοι ἅπαν τὸ πρᾶγμα ξυνθεὶς ὅτῳ τρόπῳ κατέστη ἐς τοῦτο καὶ ἐκ πλείστου ἐπιμεληθεὶς Ἀντιφῶν ἦν ἀνὴρ Ἀθηναίων τῶν καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἀρετῇ τε οὐδενὸς ὕστερος καὶ κράτιστος ἐνθυμηθῆναι γενόμενος καὶ ἃ γνοίη εἰπεῖν , καὶ ἐς μὲν δῆμον οὐ παριὼν οὐδ’ ἐς ἄλλον ἀγῶνα ἑκούσιος οὐδένα , ἀλλ’ ὑπόπτως τῷ πλήθει διὰ δόξαν δεινότητος διακείμενος , τοὺς μέντοι ἀγωνιζομένους καὶ ἐν δικαστηρίῳ καὶ ἐν δήμῳ πλεῖστα εἷς ἀνήρ , ὅστις ξυμβουλεύσαιτό τι , δυνάμενος ὠφελεῖν .
But the person who devised the whole business, and the means by which it was brought to this issue, and who for the longest time had given the subject great attention, was Antiphon, a man second to none of the Athenians of his day in point of virtue, and who had proved himself most able to devise measures, and to express his views; who also, though he did not come forward in the assembly of the people, nor by choice in any other scene of public debate, but was viewed with suspicion by the people through his reputation for cleverness, yet was most able for any one man to help those who were engaged in contest, whether in a court of justice, or before a popular assembly, whoever of them might consult him on any point.


8.68.2
5786
καὶ αὐτός τε , ἐπειδὴ † μετέστη ἡ δημοκρατία καὶ ἐς ἀγῶνας κατέστη † τὰ τῶν τετρακοσίων ἐν ὑστέρῳ μεταπεσόντα ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου ἐκακοῦτο † , ἄριστα φαίνεται τῶν μέχρι ἐμοῦ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν τούτων αἰτιαθείς , ὡς ξυγκατέστησε , θανάτου δίκην ἀπολογησάμενος .
And he himself, too, when the party of the Four Hundred had subsequently fallen, and was severely treated by the commons, appears to me to have made the best defence of all men up to my time, when tried for his life on the subject of this very government, on a charge of having assisted in setting it up.


8.68.3
5787
παρέσχε δὲ καὶ ὁ Φρύνιχος ἑαυτὸν πάντων διαφερόντως προθυμότατον ἐς τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν , δεδιὼς τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην καὶ ἐπιστάμενος εἰδότα αὐτὸν ὅσα ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ πρὸς τὸν Ἀστύοχον ἔπραξε , νομίζων οὐκ ἄν ποτε αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ὑπ’ ὀλιγαρχίας κατελθεῖν ·
Phrynichus, too, showed himself, beyond all others, most zealous for the oligarchy, through fear of Alcibiades, and the certainty that he was acquainted with the intrigues he had carried on at Samos with Astyochus;


8.68.3
5788
πολύ τε πρὸς τὰ δεινά , ἐπειδήπερ ὑπέστη , φερεγγυώτατος ἐφάνη .
for he thought that, in all probability, he would never be restored by an oligarchical government. And he showed himself, when once he had undertaken their business, by far the most capable of facing dangers.


8.68.4
5789
καὶ Θηραμένης ὁ τοῦ Ἅγνωνος ἐν τοῖς ξυγκαταλύουσι τὸν δῆμον πρῶτος ἦν , ἀνὴρ οὔτε εἰπεῖν οὔτε γνῶναι ἀδύνατος .
Theramenes the son of Hagnon was also a leader amongst those who joined in abolishing the democracy, a man of no small power, either of language or intellect.


8.68.4
5790
ὥστε ἀπ’ ἀνδρῶν πολλῶν καὶ ξυνετῶν πραχθὲν τὸ ἔργον οὐκ ἀπεικότως καίπερ μέγα ὂν προυχώρησεν ·
So that, conducted as it was by so many clever men, it was not unnatural that the business should succeed, though an arduous one.


8.68.4
5791
χαλεπὸν γὰρ ἦν τὸν Ἀθηναίων δῆμον ἐπ’ ἔτει ἑκατοστῷ μάλιστα ἐπειδὴ οἱ τύραννοι κατελύθησαν ἐλευθερίας παῦσαι , καὶ οὐ μόνον μὴ ὑπήκοον ὄντα , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑπὲρ ἥμισυ τοῦ χρόνου τούτου αὐτὸν ἄλλων ἄρχειν εἰωθότα .
For it was a difficult matter to deprive the Athenian people of its liberty, about a hundred years after the deposition of the tyrants, and when it had not only been subject to none, but accustomed also, for more than half of that period, to rule over others.


8.69.1
5792
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἡ ἐκκλησία οὐδενὸς ἀντειπόντος , ἀλλὰ κυρώσασα ταῦτα διελύθη , τοὺς τετρακοσίους ἤδη ὕστερον τρόπῳ τοιῷδε ἐς τὸ βουλευτήριον ἐσήγαγον .
When the assembly had been dissolved, without contradiction from any one, and by its own ratification of the measure, then they afterwards introduced the Four Hundred into the council-chamber, in the following manner.


8.69.1
5793
ἦσαν δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι πάντες αἰεὶ οἱ μὲν ἐπὶ τείχει , οἱ δ’ ἐν τάξει , τῶν ἐν Δεκελείᾳ πολεμίων ἕνεκα ἐφ’ ὅπλοις ·
All the Athenians, in consequence of the enemy established at Decelea, were constantly under arms, either on the walls or in the ranks.


8.69.2
5794
τῇ οὖν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τοὺς μὲν μὴ ξυνειδότας εἴασαν ὥσπερ εἰώθεσαν ἀπελθεῖν , τοῖς δ’ ἐν τῇ ξυνωμοσίᾳ εἴρητο ἡσυχῇ μὴ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς τοῖς ὅπλοις , ἀλλ’ ἄπωθεν περιμένειν , καὶ ἤν τις ἐνιστῆται τοῖς ποιουμένοις , λαβόντας τὰ ὅπλα μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν .
On that day, then, they permitted those who were not privy to their design to go home, as usual; while to those who were in the conspiracy directions were given to wait about quietly, not just by the arms, but at some little distance; and if any one should oppose what was doing, to seize the arms and not suffer it.


8.69.3
5795
ἦσαν δὲ καὶ Ἄνδριοι καὶ Τήνιοι καὶ Καρυστίων τριακόσιοι καὶ Αἰγινητῶν τῶν ἐποίκων , οὓς Ἀθηναῖοι ἔπεμψαν οἰκήσοντας , ἐπ’ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἥκοντες ἐν τοῖς ἑαυτῶν ὅπλοις , οἷς τ- αὐτὰ προείρητο .
Moreover, some Andrians and Tenians, and three hundred Carystians, with some of the Aeginetan colonists, whom the Athenians had sent to occupy that island, had come for this very purpose with their own arms; to whom directions had already been given on this subject.


8.69.4
5796
τούτων δὲ διατεταγμένων οὕτως ἐλθόντες οἱ τετρακόσιοι μετὰ ξιφιδίου ἀφανοῦς ἕκαστος , καὶ οἱ εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν μετ’ αὐτῶν Ἕλληνες νεανίσκοι , οἷς ἐχρῶντο εἴ τί που δέοι χειρουργεῖν , ἐπέστησαν τοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ κυάμου βουλευταῖς οὖσιν ἐν τῷ βουλευτηρίῳ καὶ εἶπον αὐτοῖς ἐξιέναι λαβοῦσι τὸν μισθόν ·
When these things had been thus arranged, the Four Hundred, each with dagger concealed on his person, and the hundred and twenty Grecian youths, of whose services they availed themselves wherever any business required to be dispatched, came and presented themselves to the council of Five Hundred, who were in their chamber, and told them to take their pay and go out;


8.69.4
5797
ἔφερον δὲ αὐτοῖς τοῦ ὑπολοίπου χρόνου παντὸς αὐτοὶ καὶ ἐξιοῦσιν ἐδίδοσαν .
themselves bringing it for the whole of their remaining term of office, and giving it to them when they went out.


8.70.1
5798
ὡς δὲ τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἥ τε βουλὴ οὐδὲν ἀντειποῦσα ὑπεξῆλθε καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι πολῖται οὐδὲν ἐνεωτέριζον , ἀλλ’ ἡσύχαζον , οἱ δὲ τετρακόσιοι ἐσελθόντες ἐς τὸ βουλευτήριον τότε μὲν πρυτάνεις τε σφῶν αὐτῶν ἀπεκλήρωσαν καὶ ὅσα πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐχαῖς καὶ θυσίαις καθιστάμενοι ἐς τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐχρήσαντο , ὕστερον δὲ πολὺ μεταλλάξαντες τῆς τοῦ δήμου διοικήσεως ( πλὴν τοὺς φεύγοντας οὐ κατῆγον τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἕνεκα ) τά τε ἄλλα ἔνεμον κατὰ κράτος τὴν πόλιν .
When in this way the council had withdrawn without speaking a word against it, and the rest of the citizens made no disturbance, but kept quiet, the Four Hundred then entered the council-chamber, and elected their prytanes by lot; and for what concerned the gods, offered prayers and sacrifices on installing themselves in their government. Afterwards, however, they departed widely from the popular administration, (except that they did not recall the exiles, because of Alcibiades,) and in other respects ruled the city by force. Some men, who appeared desirable to be taken out of their way, they put to death, though not many;


8.70.2
5799
καὶ ἄνδρας τέ τινας ἀπέκτειναν οὐ πολλούς , οἳ ἐδόκουν ἐπιτήδειοι εἶναι ὑπεξαιρεθῆναι , καὶ ἄλλους ἔδησαν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ μετεστήσαντο ·
others they put in prison, and others they banished.


8.70.2
5800
πρός τε Ἆγιν τὸν Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλέα ὄντα ἐν τῇ Δεκελείᾳ ἐπεκηρυκεύοντο , λέγοντες διαλλαγῆναι βούλεσθαι καὶ εἰκὸς εἶναι αὐτὸν σφίσι καὶ οὐκέτι τῷ ἀπίστῳ δήμῳ μᾶλλον ξυγχωρεῖν .
They also entered into communication with Agis, the Lacedaemonian king, who was at Decelea; telling him that they were desirous of making peace, and that it was but reasonable that, as he would treat with them and no longer with the faithless multitude, he should more readily come to terms.


8.71.1
5801
ὁ δὲ νομίζων τὴν πόλιν οὐχ ἡσυχάζειν , οὐδ’ εὐθὺς οὕτω τὸν δῆμον τὴν παλαιὰν ἐλευθερίαν παραδώσειν , εἴ τε στρατιὰν πολλὴν ἴδοι σφῶν , οὐκ ἂν ἡσυχάζειν , οὐδ’ ἐν τῷ παρόντι πάνυ τι πιστεύων μὴ οὐκέτι ταράσσεσθαι αὐτούς , τοῖς μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων ἐλθοῦσιν οὐδὲν ξυμβατικὸν ἀπεκρίνατο , προσμεταπεμψάμενος δὲ ἐκ Πελοποννήσου στρατιὰν πολλὴν οὐ πολλῷ ὕστερον καὶ αὐτὸς τῇ ἐκ τῆς Δεκελείας φρουρᾷ μετὰ τῶν ἐλθόντων κατέβη πρὸς αὐτὰ τὰ τείχη τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ἐλπίσας ἢ ταραχθέντας αὐτοὺς μᾶλλον ἂν χειρωθῆναι σφίσιν ᾗ βούλονται ἢ καὶ αὐτοβοεὶ ἂν διὰ τὸν ἔνδοθέν τε καὶ ἔξωθεν κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς γενησόμενον θόρυβον ·
He, however, thought that the city was not in a settled state, and that the people would not so immediately give up their ancient liberty, nor remain quiet, if they should see a large force of Lacedaemonians; and not being quite sure at present that they were no longer in a disturbed condition, he made no conciliatory answer to those who had come from the Four Hundred, but sent for a large additional force from the Peloponnese, and not long after went down himself with the garrison from Decelea, in conjunction with the troops which had joined him, to the very walls of Athens; hoping that either the people there, being thrown into disorder, would submit on his own terms, or that in consequence of the confusion which would probably be created both within and without,


8.71.1
5802
τῶν γὰρ μακρῶν τειχῶν διὰ τὴν κατ’ αὐτὰ ἐρημίαν λήψεως οὐκ ἂν ἁμαρτεῖν .
he could not fail to carry the long walls on the first assault, owing to the absence of troops along them for their defence.


8.71.2
5803
ὡς δὲ προσέμειξέ τε ἐγγὺς καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ μὲν ἔνδοθεν οὐδ’ ὁπωστιοῦν ἐκίνησαν , τοὺς δὲ ἱππέας ἐκπέμψαντες καὶ μέρος τι τῶν ὁπλιτῶν καὶ ψιλῶν καὶ τοξοτῶν ἄνδρας τε κατέβαλον αὐτῶν διὰ τὸ ἐγγὺς προσελθεῖν καὶ ὅπλων τινῶν καὶ νεκρῶν ἐκράτησαν , οὕτω δὴ γνοὺς ἀπήγαγε πάλιν τὴν στρατιάν .
But when he approached near to the city, and the Athenians made not the slightest stir within, while they sent out their cavalry, with a division of their heavy-armed, light-armed, and archers, and shot down some of the enemy in consequence of their near advance, and got possession of some arms and dead bodies, then indeed, finding this to be the case, he led his army back again.


8.71.3
5804
καὶ αὐτὸς μὲν καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ κατὰ χώραν ἐν τῇ Δεκελείᾳ ἔμενον , τοὺς δ’ ἐπελθόντας ὀλίγας τινὰς ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ γῇ μείναντας ἀπέπεμψεν ἐπ’ οἴκου .
He and his own troops still remained in their former position at Decelea, but the newly arrived forces he sent home, after they had staid in the country some few days.


8.71.3
5805
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο παρά τε τὸν Ἆγιν ἐπρεσβεύοντο οἱ τετρακόσιοι οὐδὲν ἧσσον , κ- ἐκείνου μᾶλλον ἤδη προσδεχομένου καὶ παραινοῦντος ἐκπέμπουσι καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα περὶ ξυμβάσεως πρέσβεις , βουλόμενοι διαλλαγῆναι .
After this, the Four Hundred sent an embassy to Agis nevertheless; and when he now received them more favourably, and advised them to that effect, they sent envoys to Lacedaemon also to negotiate a treaty, being desirous of peace.


8.72.1
5806
πέμπουσι δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν Σάμον δέκα ἄνδρας παραμυθησομένους τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ διδάξοντας ὡς οὐκ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ τῆς πόλεως καὶ τῶν πολιτῶν ἡ ὀλιγαρχία κατέστη , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ τῶν ξυμπάντων πραγμάτων , πεντακισχίλιοί τε ὅτι εἶεν καὶ οὐ τετρακόσιοι μόνον οἱ πράσσοντες ·
They likewise sent ten men to Samos, to reassure the troops, and to tell them that the oligarchy had not been established for the injury of the city and the citizens, but for the preservation of the whole state;


8.72.1
5807
καίτοι οὐ πώποτε Ἀθηναίους διὰ τὰς στρατείας καὶ τὴν ὑπερόριον ἀσχολίαν ἐς οὐδὲν πρᾶγμα οὕτω μέγα ἐλθεῖν βουλεύσοντας ἐν ᾧ πεντακισχιλίους ξυνελθεῖν .
moreover, that there were five thousand, and not four hundred only, who had a share in the government; though never yet, in consequence of their expeditions and their foreign occupations, had the Athenians come to consult on a business of such importance that five thousand of them assembled for the purpose.


8.72.2
5808
ἄλλα τ’ ἐπιστείλαντες τὰ πρέποντα εἰπεῖν ἀπέπεμψαν αὐτοὺς εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν ἑαυτῶν κατάστασιν , δείσαντες μή , ὅπερ ἐγένετο , ναυτικὸς ὄχλος οὔτ’ αὐτὸς μένειν ἐν τῷ ὀλιγαρχικῷ κόσμῳ ἐθέλῃ , σφᾶς τε μὴ ἐκεῖθεν ἀρξαμένου τοῦ κακοῦ μεταστήσωσιν .
They gave them, too, all other instructions as to what was suitable for them to say, and despatched them immediately after their own estabment in power, being afraid that a mob of sailors might (as was really the case) both themselves refuse to continue under the government of an oligarchy, and through the evil spreading from that quarter be the means of deposing them.


8.73.1
5809
ἐν γὰρ τῇ Σάμῳ ἐνεωτερίζετο ἤδη τὰ περὶ τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν , καὶ ξυνέβη τοιάδε γενέσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτὸν τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον ὅνπερ οἱ τετρακόσιοι ξυνίσταντο .
For at Samos the oligarchy was already made the subject of new measures, and the following events happened at the very time that the Four Hundred were conspiring.


8.73.2
5810
οἱ γὰρ τότε τῶν Σαμίων ἐπαναστάντες τοῖς δυνατοῖς καὶ ὄντες δῆμος μεταβαλλόμενοι αὖθις καὶ πεισθέντες ὑπό τε τοῦ Πεισάνδρου , ὅτε ἦλθε , καὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ ξυνεστώτων Ἀθηναίων ἐγένοντό τε ἐς τριακοσίους ξυνωμόται καὶ ἔμελλον τοῖς ἄλλοις ὡς δήμῳ ὄντι ἐπιθήσεσθαι .
Those of the Samians who had risen up against the aristocratical party, and constituted the commons, turning round again, and being prevailed upon by Pisander on his arrival, and by the Athenians who were in the conspiracy at Samos, both bound themselves by oaths to the number of three hundred, and were prepared to attack the rest, as forming the democratical party.


8.73.3
5811
καὶ Ὑπέρβολόν τέ τινα τῶν Ἀθηναίων , μοχθηρὸν ἄνθρωπον , ὠστρακισμένον οὐ διὰ δυνάμεως καὶ ἀξιώματος φόβον , ἀλλὰ διὰ πονηρίαν καὶ αἰσχύνην τῆς πόλεως , ἀποκτείνουσι μετὰ Χαρμίνου τε ἑνὸς τῶν στρατηγῶν καί τινων τῶν παρὰ σφίσιν Ἀθηναίων , πίστιν διδόντες αὐτοῖς , καὶ ἄλλα μετ’ αὐτῶν τοιαῦτα ξυνέπραξαν , τοῖς τε πλέοσιν ὥρμηντο ἐπιτίθεσθαι .
They also put to death one Hyperbolus, an Athenian, a base fellow, who had been ostracised, not from fear of his influence or rank, but for his villany, and for being a disgrace to the city; acting in the matter in concert with Charminus, one of the generals, and a party of Athenians who were with them, and to whom they had given pledges of faith. They likewise perpetrated other such deeds in conjunction with that party, and had determined to make an attack on the populace.


8.73.4
5812
οἱ δὲ αἰσθόμενοι τῶν τε στρατηγῶν Λέοντι καὶ Διομέδοντι ( οὗτοι γὰρ οὐχ ἑκόντες διὰ τὸ τιμᾶσθαι ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου ἔφερον τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν ) τὸ μέλλον σημαίνουσι καὶ Θρασυβούλῳ καὶ Θρασύλῳ , τῷ μὲν τριηραρχοῦντι , τῷ δὲ ὁπλιτεύοντι , καὶ ἄλλοις οἳ ἐδόκουν αἰεὶ μάλιστα ἐναντιοῦσθαι τοῖς ξυνεστῶσιν ·
They, however, having notice of their design, revealed what was going to be done to Leon and Diomedon, two of the generals, (for these submitted to the oligarchy against their will, from being honoured by the people,) and to Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus, the former serving as a trierarch, the latter in the heavy infantry, as well as some others who had always been thought to be most opposed to the conspirators; begging them not to stand still and permit them to be ruined, and Samos to be lost to the Athenians, through whose help alone their empire had held together up to this time.


8.73.4
5813
καὶ οὐκ ἠξίουν περιιδεῖν αὐτοὺς σφᾶς τε διαφθαρέντας καὶ Σάμον Ἀθηναίοις ἀλλοτριωθεῖσαν , δι’ ἣν μόνον μέχρι νῦν ἡ ἀρχὴ αὐτοῖς ἐς τοῦτο ξυνέμεινεν .
and not to permit them to be destroyed and Samos alienated from the Athenians, through whose support their empire had held together up to this time.


8.73.5
5814
οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες τῶν τε στρατιωτῶν ἕνα ἕκαστον μετῇσαν μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν , καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα τοὺς Παράλους , ἄνδρας Ἀθηναίους τε καὶ ἐλευθέρους πάντας ἐν τῇ νηὶ πλέοντας καὶ αἰεὶ δήποτε ὀλιγαρχίᾳ καὶ μὴ παρούσῃ ἐπικειμένους ·
On hearing this, they went to every one of the soldiers, and exhorted them not to put up with it, and especially the crew of the Paralus, as all on board of that vessel were Athenians and freemen, and had always been most bitter against an oligarchical government, even before there was one established.


8.73.5
5815
ὅ τε Λέων καὶ ὁ Διομέδων αὐτοῖς ναῦς τινάς , ὁπότε ποι πλέοιεν , κατέλειπον φύλακας .
Leon and Diomedon also left them some ships for their protection, whenever they might themselves sail any where.


8.73.6
5816
ὥστε ἐπειδὴ αὐτοῖς ἐπετίθεντο οἱ τριακόσιοι , βοηθησάντων πάντων τούτων , μάλιστα δὲ τῶν Παράλων , περιεγένοντο οἱ τῶν Σαμίων πλέονες , καὶ τριάκοντα μέν τινας ἀπέκτειναν τῶν τριακοσίων , τρεῖς δὲ τοὺς αἰτιωτάτους φυγῇ ἐζημίωσαν ·
Of the three hundred they put to death some thirty, and banished three who were the most guilty;


8.73.6
5817
τοῖς δ’ ἄλλοις οὐ μνησικακοῦντες δημοκρατούμενοι τὸ λοιπὸν ξυνεπολίτευον .
while with the rest they entered into an amnesty, and lived together for the future under a democratical government.


8.74.1
5818
τὴν δὲ Πάραλον ναῦν καὶ Χαιρέαν ἐπ’ αὐτῆς τὸν Ἀρχεστράτου , ἄνδρα Ἀθηναῖον , γενόμενον ἐς τὴν μετάστασιν πρόθυμον , ἀποπέμπουσιν οἵ τε Σάμιοι καὶ οἱ στρατιῶται κατὰ τάχος ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἀπαγγελοῦντα τὰ γεγενημένα ·
The ship Paralus, and Chaereas son of Archestratus on board of it—an Athenian who had been forward in the revolution—were sent by the Samians and the soldiers with all speed to Athens, to carry the news of what had taken place;


8.74.1
5819
οὐ γὰρ ᾔδεσάν πω τοὺς τετρακοσίους ἄρχοντας .
for they were not yet aware of the Four Hundred being in power.


8.74.2
5820
καὶ καταπλευσάντων αὐτῶν εὐθέως τῶν μὲν Παράλων τινὰς οἱ τετρακόσιοι δύο ἢ τρεῖς ἔδησαν , τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ἀφελόμενοι τὴν ναῦν καὶ μετεμβιβάσαντες ἐς ἄλλην στρατιῶτιν ναῦν ἔταξαν φρουρεῖν περὶ Εὔβοιαν .
On their sailing into harbour, the Four Hundred immediately threw some two or three of the crew into prison, and having taken their vessel from them, and removed them into another employed as a troop-ship, they set them to keep guard round Euboea. Chaereas, by some means or other, immediately secreted himself;


8.74.3
5821
ὁ δὲ Χαιρέας εὐθὺς διαλαθών πως , ὡς εἶδε τὰ παρόντα , πάλιν ἐς τὴν Σάμον ἐλθὼν ἀγγέλλει τοῖς στρατιώταις ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον πάντα δεινώσας τὰ ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν , ὡς πληγαῖς τε πάντας ζημιοῦσι καὶ ἀντειπεῖν ἔστιν οὐδὲν πρὸς τοὺς ἔχοντας τὴν πολιτείαν , καὶ ὅτι αὐτῶν καὶ γυναῖκες καὶ παῖδες ὑβρίζονται , καὶ διανοοῦνται , ὁπόσοι ἐν Σάμῳ στρατεύονται μὴ ὄντες τῆς σφετέρας γνώμης , τούτων πάντων τοὺς προσήκοντας λαβόντες εἴρξειν , ἵνα , ἢν μὴ ὑπακούσωσι , τεθνήκωσιν ·
and when he saw the present state of things, he went back to Samos, and took the soldiers an exaggerated report of affairs at Athens, aggravating every thing, and telling them that " they were punishing all with stripes, and it was impossible to speak a word against those who held the government; moreover, that their wives and children were outraged, and that they intended to seize and confine all the relatives of such as were in the army at Samos and not on their own side, in order that, if they would not submit to them, the prisoners might be put to death:"


8.74.3
5822
καὶ ἄλλα πολλὰ ἐπικαταψευδόμενος ἔλεγεν .
with many other false statements which he made beside.


8.75.1
5823
οἱ δὲ ἀκούοντες ἐπὶ τοὺς τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν μάλιστα ποιήσαντας καὶ ἔτι τῶν ἄλλων τοὺς μετασχόντας τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ὥρμησαν βάλλειν , ἔπειτα μέντοι ὑπὸ τῶν διὰ μέσου κωλυθέντες καὶ διδαχθέντες μὴ τῶν πολεμίων ἀντιπρῴρων ἐγγὺς ἐφορμούντων ἀπολέσωσι τὰ πράγματα , ἐπαύσαντο .
On hearing this, they were at first strongly inclined to make an attack on those who had been the chief authors of the oligarchy, and such of the rest as had taken part in it. Afterwards, however, being prevented by the men of moderate views, and warned not to ruin their cause, while the enemy were lying so near them with their ships ready for action, they desisted from it.


8.75.2
5824
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο λαμπρῶς ἤδη ἐς δημοκρατίαν βουλόμενοι μεταστῆσαι τὰ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ ὅ τε Θρασύβουλος ὁ τοῦ Λύκου καὶ Θράσυλος ( οὗτοι γὰρ μάλιστα προειστήκεσαν τῆς μεταβολῆς ) ὥρκωσαν πάντας τοὺς στρατιώτας τοὺς μεγίστους ὅρκους , καὶ αὐτοὺς τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας μάλιστα , ἦ μὴν δημοκρατήσεσθαί τε καὶ ὁμονοήσειν καὶ τὸν πρὸς Πελοποννησίους πόλεμον προθύμως διοίσειν καὶ τοῖς τετρακοσίοις πολέμιοί τε ἔσεσθαι καὶ οὐδὲν ἐπικηρυκεύσεσθαι .
After this, wishing openly now to change the government at Samos to a democracy, Thrasybulus the son of Lycus, and Thrasylus, (for these were the chief leaders in the revolution,) bound all the soldiers, and, most of all, the oligarchical party themselves, by the most solemn oaths, that they would assuredly be governed by a democracy, and live in concord; and also that they would zealously prosecute the war with the Peloponnesians. and would be foes to the Four Hundred, and hold no intercourse with them.


8.75.3
5825
ξυνώμνυσαν δὲ καὶ Σαμίων πάντες τὸν αὐτὸν ὅρκον οἱ ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ , καὶ τὰ πράγματα πάντα καὶ τὰ ἀποβησόμενα ἐκ τῶν κινδύνων ξυνεκοινώσαντο οἱ στρατιῶται τοῖς Σαμίοις , νομίζοντες οὔτε ἐκείνοις ἀποστροφὴν σωτηρίας οὔτε σφίσιν εἶναι , ἀλλ’ , ἐάν τε οἱ τετρακόσιοι κρατήσωσιν ἐάν τε οἱ ἐκ Μιλήτου πολέμιοι , διαφθαρήσεσθαι .
All the Samians too, who were of full age, took the same oath with them; and the soldiers communicated to the Samians all the circumstances, and the probable results of their dangers, thinking that neither for them nor for themselves was there any resource that could save them, but that if either the Four Hundred or the enemy at Miletus should defeat them, they would be destroyed.


8.76.1
5826
ἐς φιλονικίαν τε καθέστασαν τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον οἱ μὲν τὴν πόλιν ἀναγκάζοντες δημοκρατεῖσθαι , οἱ δὲ τὸ στρατόπεδον ὀλιγαρχεῖσθαι .
Thus they were engaged in contention at this time, the one party wishing to force the city to a democracy, the other to an oligarchy.


8.76.2
5827
ἐποίησαν δὲ καὶ ἐκκλησίαν εὐθὺς οἱ στρατιῶται , ἐν ᾗ τοὺς μὲν προτέρους στρατηγούς , καὶ εἴ τινα τῶν τριηράρχων ὑπώπτευον , ἔπαυσαν , ἄλλους δὲ ἀνθείλοντο καὶ τριηράρχους καὶ στρατηγούς , ὧν Θρασύβουλός τε καὶ Θράσυλος ὑπῆρχον .
And the soldiers immediately held an assembly, in which they deposed their former generals, and any of the trierarchs whom they suspected, and chose others in their place, both trierarchs and generals; of whom Thrasybulus and Thrasylus were two. They also stood up and exhorted one another, both on other topics and on this;


8.76.3
5828
καὶ παραινέσεις ἄλλας τε ἐποιοῦντο ἐν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἀνιστάμενοι καὶ ὡς οὐ δεῖ ἀθυμεῖν ὅτι ἡ πόλις αὐτῶν ἀφέστηκεν ·
" that they ought not to be disheartened because the city had revolted from them;


8.76.3
5829
τοὺς γὰρ ἐλάσσους ἀπὸ σφῶν τῶν πλεόνων καὶ ἐς πάντα ποριμωτέρων μεθεστάναι .
for it was but the smaller party which had separated from them who were the larger, and better provided in all respects."


8.76.4
5830
ἐχόντων γὰρ σφῶν τὸ πᾶν ναυτικόν , τάς τε ἄλλας πόλεις ὧν ἄρχουσιν ἀναγκάσειν τὰ χρήματα ὁμοίως διδόναι καὶ εἰ ἐκεῖθεν ὡρμῶντο ( πόλιν τε γὰρ σφίσιν ὑπάρχειν Σάμον οὐκ ἀσθενῆ , ἀλλ’ ἣ παρ’ ἐλάχιστον δὴ ἦλθε τὸ Ἀθηναίων κράτος τῆς θαλάσσης , ὅτε ἐπολέμησεν , ἀφελέσθαι , τούς τε πολεμίους ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ χωρίου ἀμυνεῖσθαι οὗπερ καὶ πρότερον ) , καὶ δυνατώτεροι εἶναι σφεῖς ἔχοντες τὰς ναῦς πορίζεσθαι τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει .
" For since they held the whole fleet at their command, they would compel the other cities under their dominion to give them money, just the same as though they were coming from Athens. For they had a city in Samos, and no weak one either, but such as, when at war with them, had been within a very little of taking away the command of the sea which the Athenians enjoyed. And as for the enemy, they were defending themselves against them from the same position as before. They, then, inasmuch as they had command of the ships, were more able to provide themselves with necessaries than those at home. Nay, it was through their being stationed in advance at Samos, that those at home had before commanded the entrance to the Piraeus;"


8.76.5
5831
καὶ δι’ ἑαυτοὺς δὲ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ προκαθημένους καὶ πρότερον αὐτοὺς κρατεῖν τοῦ ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ ἔσπλου , καὶ νῦν ἐς τοιοῦτον καταστήσονται μὴ βουλομένων σφίσι πάλιν τὴν πολιτείαν ἀποδοῦναι , ὥστε αὐτοὶ δυνατώτεροι εἶναι εἴργειν ἐκείνους τῆς θαλάσσης ἢ ὑπ’ ἐκείνων εἴργεσθαι .
" and now also they would be brought to such a strait, should they not consent to give them back the government, that they themselves would be better able to exclude them from the sea than to be excluded from it by them."


8.76.6
5832
βραχύ τέ τι εἶναι καὶ οὐδενὸς ἄξιον ὃ πρὸς τὸ περιγίγνεσθαι τῶν πολεμίων ἡ πόλις σφίσι χρήσιμος ἦν , καὶ οὐδὲν ἀπολωλεκέναι , οἵ γε μήτε ἀργύριον εἶχον ἔτι πέμπειν , ἀλλ’ αὐτοὶ ἐπορίζοντο οἱ στρατιῶται , μήτε βούλευμα χρηστόν , οὗπερ ἕνεκα πόλις στρατοπέδων κρατεῖ ·
" Indeed it was but a trifling and inconsiderable degree in which the city was of use to them towards gaining the victory over the enemy;


8.76.6
5833
ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τούτοις τοὺς μὲν ἡμαρτηκέναι τοὺς πατρίους νόμους καταλύσαντας , αὐτοὶ δὲ σῴζειν καὶ ἐκείνους πειράσεσθαι προσαναγκάζειν , ὥστε οὐδὲ τούτους , οἵπερ ἂν βουλεύοιέν τι χρηστόν , παρὰ σφίσι χείρους εἶναι .
and they had lost nothing in losing those who had neither any more money to send them, (but the soldiers provided it themselves,) nor yet good counsel to give them, for the sake of which a state has authority over armaments. On the contrary, even on these points the other party had done wrong by abolishing the laws of their fathers; while they themselves maintained those laws, and would endeavour to make do it also. So that neither had they the inferiority as regarded those who should give good counsel."


8.76.7
5834
Ἀλκιβιάδην τε , ἢν αὐτῷ ἄδειάν τε καὶ κάθοδον ποιήσωσιν , ἄσμενον τὴν παρὰ βασιλέως ξυμμαχίαν παρέξειν .
" Alcibiades, too, would gladly secure them the alliance of the king, should they grant to him security of person and a restoration to his country.


8.76.7
5835
τό τε μέγιστον , ἢν ἁπάντων σφάλλωνται , εἶναι αὐτοῖς τοσοῦτον ἔχουσι ναυτικὸν πολλὰς τὰς ἀποχωρήσεις ἐν αἷς καὶ πόλεις καὶ γῆν εὑρήσουσιν .
And what was most important, should they fail on all points, yet, having so large a fleet as they had, there were many places for them to retire to, in which they would find both cities and territory."


8.77.1
5836
τοιαῦτα ἐν ἀλλήλοις ἐκκλησιάσαντες καὶ παραθαρσύναντες σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰ τοῦ πολέμου παρεσκευάζοντο οὐδὲν ἧσσον .
Having thus debated the matter together, and encouraged one another, they proceeded to make preparations for the war no less than before;


8.77.1
5837
οἱ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων πεμφθέντες ἐς τὴν Σάμον οἱ δέκα πρεσβευταὶ ὡς ταῦτα ἐν τῇ Δήλῳ ἤδη ὄντες ᾐσθάνοντο , ἡσύχαζον αὐτοῦ .
and the ten ambassadors who had been sent to Samos by the Four Hundred, hearing of this when they were now at Delos, remained quiet there.


8.78.1
5838
ὑπὸ δὲ τὸν χρόνον τοῦτον καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ἐν τῷ ναυτικῷ στρατιῶται κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς διεβόων ὡς ὑπό τε Ἀστυόχου καὶ Τισσαφέρνους φθείρεται τὰ πράγματα , τοῦ μὲν οὐκ ἐθέλοντος οὔτε πρότερον ναυμαχεῖν , ἕως ἔτι αὐτοί τε ἔρρωντο μᾶλλον καὶ τὸ ναυτικὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὀλίγον ἦν , οὔτε νῦν , ὅτε στασιάζειν τε λέγονται καὶ αἱ νῆες αὐτῶν οὐδέπω ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ εἰσίν , ἀλλὰ τὰς παρὰ Τισσαφέρνους Φοινίσσας ναῦς μένοντες , ἄλλως ὄνομα καὶ οὐκ ἔργον , κινδυνεύσειν διατριβῆναι ·
About this time also the soldiers in the Peloponnesian fleet at Miletus were raising a clamour amongst themselves, about their cause being ruined by Astyochus and Tissaphernes. For Astyochus, they said, would neither fight before, while they themselves were still the stronger, and the Athenian fleet was small, nor would he now, when the enemy were said to be in a state of sedition, and their ships were not yet brought together;


8.78.1
5839
τὸν δ’ αὖ Τισσαφέρνην τάς τε ναῦς ταύτας οὐ κομίζειν , καὶ τροφὴν ὅτι οὐ ξυνεχῶς οὐδ’ ἐντελῆ διδοὺς κακοῖ τὸ ναυτικόν .
but they would run the risk of being worn out by delay, while waiting for the Phoenician fleet—an idle pretence, and not a reality. And Tissaphernes, on the other hand, did not bring up this fleet, and at the same time injured their own navy by not giving them supplies regularly, or to the full amount.


8.78.1
5840
οὔκουν ἔφασαν χρῆναι μέλλειν ἔτι , ἀλλὰ διαναυμαχεῖν .
They ought therefore to wait no longer, but to come to a decisive engagement at sea. It was the Syracusans that most especially urged this.


8.79.1
5841
καὶ μάλιστα οἱ Συρακόσιοι ἐνῆγον .
The confederates, and particularly Astyochus, hearing these murmurs, and having resolved in council to fight a decisive battle, since the disturbances at Samos were also reported to them,


8.79.1
5842
αἰσθόμενοι δὲ οἱ ξύμμαχοι καὶ ὁ Ἀστύοχος τὸν θροῦν , καὶ δόξαν αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ ξυνόδου ὥστε διαναυμαχεῖν , ἐπειδὴ καὶ ἐσηγγέλλετο αὐτοῖς ἡ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ ταραχή , ἄραντες ταῖς ναυσὶ πάσαις οὔσαις δώδεκα καὶ ἑκατὸν καὶ τοὺς Μιλησίους πεζῇ κελεύσαντες ἐπὶ τῆς Μυκάλης παριέναι ἔπλεον ὡς πρὸς τὴν Μυκάλην .
they weighed anchor with all their ships, amounting to a hundred and twelve, and having given orders for the Milesians to march by land towards Mycale, they sailed to the same place.


8.79.2
5843
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ταῖς ἐκ Σάμου ναυσὶ δυοῖν καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα , αἳ ἔτυχον ἐν Γλαύκῃ τῆς Μυκάλης ὁρμοῦσαι ( διέχει δὲ ὀλίγον ταύτῃ ἡ Σάμος τῆς ἠπείρου πρὸς τὴν Μυκάλην ) , ὡς εἶδον τὰς τῶν Πελοποννησίων ναῦς προσπλεούσας , ὑπεχώρησαν ἐς τὴν Σάμον , οὐ νομίσαντες τῷ πλήθει διακινδυνεῦσαι περὶ τοῦ παντὸς ἱκανοὶ εἶναι .
But the Athenians with their eighty-two ships which were lying at Glauce in the territory of Mycale, (Samos being but a short distance from the mainland at this point, opposite Mycale,) when they saw the Peloponnesian fleet sailing against them, retired to Samos, not thinking themselves sufficiently strong in numbers to risk a battle for their all.


8.79.3
5844
καὶ ἅμα ( προῄσθοντο γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου ναυμαχησείοντας ) προσεδέχοντο καὶ τὸν Στρομβιχίδην ἐκ τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου σφίσι ταῖς ἐκ τῆς Χίου ναυσὶν ἐπ’ Ἀβύδου ἀφικομέναις προσβοηθήσειν ·
Besides, as they had had notice from Miletus of the enemy's wish for an engagement, they were expecting Strombichides from the Hellespont, to reinforce them with the ships which had gone from Chios to Abydus;


8.79.3
5845
προυπέπεμπτο γὰρ αὐτῷ ἄγγελος .
for a messenger had previously been sent to him. Thus they retired to Samos;


8.79.4
5846
καὶ οἱ μὲν οὕτως ἐπὶ τῆς Σάμου ἀνεχώρησαν , οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι καταπλεύσαντες ἐπὶ τῆς Μυκάλης ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο , καὶ τῶν Μιλησίων καὶ τῶν πλησιοχώρων ὁ πεζός .
while the Peloponnesians put in at Mycale, and formed their encampment, with the land forces of the Milesians and the people in the neighbourhood.


8.79.5
5847
καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ μελλόντων αὐτῶν ἐπιπλεῖν τῇ Σάμῳ ἀγγέλλεται ὁ Στρομβιχίδης ταῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου ναυσὶν ἀφιγμένος ·
The next day, when they were going to advance against Samos, tidings reached them of the arrival of Strombichides with the squadron from the Hellespont,


8.79.5
5848
καὶ εὐθὺς ἀπέπλεον πάλιν ἐπὶ τῆς Μιλήτου .
and they immediately sailed back again to Miletus.


8.79.6
5849
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι προσγενομένων σφίσι τῶν νεῶν ἐπίπλουν αὐτοὶ ποιοῦνται τῇ Μιλήτῳ ναυσὶν ὀκτὼ καὶ ἑκατὸν βουλόμενοι διαναυμαχῆσαι ·
The Athenians, when their squadron had joined them, advanced themselves against Miletus with a hundred and eight ships, wishing to come to a decisive battle;


8.79.6
5850
καὶ ὡς οὐδεὶς αὐτοῖς ἀντανήγετο , ἀπέπλευσαν πάλιν ἐς τὴν Σάμον .
but when no one came out to meet them, they sailed back again to Samos.


8.80.1
5851
ἐν δὲ τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει μετὰ τοῦτο εὐθὺς οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι , ἐπειδὴ ἁθρόαις ταῖς ναυσὶν οὐκ ἀξιόμαχοι νομίσαντες εἶναι οὐκ ἀντανήγοντο , ἀπορήσαντες ὁπόθεν τοσαύταις ναυσὶ χρήματα ἕξουσιν , ἄλλως τε καὶ Τισσαφέρνους κακῶς διδόντος , ἀποστέλλουσιν ὡς τὸν Φαρνάβαζον , ὥσπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἐκ τῆς Πελοποννήσου προσετάχθη , Κλέαρχον τὸν Ῥαμφίου ἔχοντα ναῦς τεσσαράκοντα .
The same summer, and immediately after this, since the Peloponnesians had not with their whole united fleet offered battle to the enemy, not thinking themselves a match for them, they were at a loss from what quarter to get money for such a number of vessels, especially as Tissaphernes supplied it ill; and therefore they sent Clearchus the son of Ramphias with forty ships to Pharnabazus, in accordance with the original orders from the Peloponnese.


8.80.2
5852
ἐπεκαλεῖτό τε γὰρ αὐτοὺς ὁ Φαρνάβαζος καὶ τροφὴν ἑτοῖμος ἦν παρέχειν , καὶ ἅμα καὶ τὸ Βυζάντιον ἐπεκηρυκεύετο αὐτοῖς ἀποστῆναι .
For Pharnabazus invited them to his aid, and was prepared to furnish them with supplies; and at the same time intelligence reached them that Byzantium had revolted.


8.80.3
5853
καὶ αἱ μὲν τῶν Πελοποννησίων αὗται νῆες ἀπάρασαι ἐς τὸ πέλαγος , ὅπως λάθοιεν ἐν τῷ πλῷ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , χειμασθεῖσαι , καὶ αἱ μὲν Δήλου λαβόμεναι αἱ πλείους μετὰ Κλεάρχου καὶ ὕστερον πάλιν ἐλθοῦσαι ἐς Μίλητον ( Κλέαρχος δὲ κατὰ γῆν αὖθις ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον κομισθεὶς ἦρχεν ) , αἱ δὲ μετὰ Ἑλίξου τοῦ Μεγαρέως στρατηγοῦ δέκα ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον διασωθεῖσαι Βυζάντιον ἀφιστᾶσιν .
Accordingly, these ships of the Peloponnesians put out into the open sea, in order to escape the observation of the Athenians during their voyage; but were overtaken by a storm, and the greater part of them put into Delos with Clearchus, and subsequently returned to Miletus, (Clearchus, however, afterwards went to the Hellespont by land, and entered on his command,) while the rest, to the number of ten, arrived safe at the Hellespont with Helixus the Megarean, and effected the revolt of Byzantium.


8.80.4
5854
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα οἱ ἐκ τῆς Σάμου πέμπουσιν αἰσθόμενοι νεῶν βοήθειαν καὶ φυλακὴν ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον , καί τις καὶ ναυμαχία βραχεῖα γίγνεται πρὸ τοῦ Βυζαντίου ναυσὶν ὀκτὼ πρὸς ὀκτώ .
After this, when the commanders at Samos were aware of it, they sent some ships to the Hellespont to oppose them and keep guard against them; and a trifling battle was fought at sea before Byzantium, between eight vessels against eight.


8.81.1
5855
οἱ δὲ προεστῶτες ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ καὶ μάλιστα Θρασύβουλος , αἰεί γε τῆς αὐτῆς γνώμης ἐχόμενος , ἐπειδὴ μετέστησε τὰ πράγματα , ὥστε κατάγειν Ἀλκιβιάδην , καὶ τέλος ἀπ’ ἐκκλησίας ἔπεισε τὸ πλῆθος τῶν στρατιωτῶν , καὶ ψηφισαμένων αὐτῶν Ἀλκιβιάδῃ κάθοδον καὶ ἄδειαν πλεύσας ὡς τὸν Τισσαφέρνην κατῆγεν ἐς τὴν Σάμον τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην , νομίζων μόνην σωτηρίαν εἰ Τισσαφέρνην αὐτοῖς μεταστήσειεν ἀπὸ Πελοποννησίων .
Now the leading men at Samos, and especially Thrasybulus, had all along retained the same purpose, ever since he had effected a change in the government, namely, to restore Alcibiades; and at length, in an assembly, he persuaded the greater part of the soldiers to the same; and when they had passed a decree for the return and security of Alcibiades, he sailed to Tissaphernes, and brought Alcibiades to Samos, thinking that their only chance of preservation was his bringing Tissaphernes over from the Peloponnesians to them.


8.81.2
5856
γενομένης δὲ ἐκκλησίας τήν τε ἰδίαν ξυμφορὰν τῆς φυγῆς ἐπῃτιάσατο καὶ ἀνωλοφύρατο ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης , καὶ περὶ τῶν πολιτικῶν πολλὰ εἰπὼν ἐς ἐλπίδας τε αὐτοὺς οὐ σμικρὰς τῶν μελλόντων καθίστη , καὶ ὑπερβάλλων ἐμεγάλυνε τὴν ἑαυτοῦ δύναμιν παρὰ τῷ Τισσαφέρνει , ἵνα οἵ τε οἴκοι τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν ἔχοντες φοβοῖντο αὐτὸν καὶ μᾶλλον αἱ ξυνωμοσίαι διαλυθεῖεν καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ τιμιώτερόν τε αὐτὸν ἄγοιεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐπὶ πλέον θαρσοῖεν , οἵ τε πολέμιοι τῷ Τισσαφέρνει ὡς μάλιστα διαβάλλοιντο καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑπαρχουσῶν ἐλπίδων ἐκπίπτοιεν .
An assembly therefore having been convened, Alcibiades both complained of and deplored his own calamity in having been banished, and by speaking at great length on public matters raised them to no slight hopes for the future; and extravagantly magnified his own influence with Tissaphernes, in order that both the members of the oligarchy at home might be afraid of him, and the clubs be the more quickly broken up; and also that those at Samos might hold him in the greater honour, and be more encouraged themselves; and that the enemy, moreover, might be as much as possible set against Tissaphernes, and cast down from their present hopes. Accordingly Alcibiades, in the most boastful strain, held out these promises to them;


8.81.3
5857
ὑπισχνεῖτο δ’ οὖν τάδε μέγιστα ἐπικομπῶν ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης , ὡς Τισσαφέρνης αὐτῷ ὑπεδέξατο ἦ μήν , ἕως ἄν τι τῶν ἑαυτοῦ λείπηται , ἢν Ἀθηναίοις πιστεύσῃ , μὴ ἀπορήσειν αὐτοὺς τροφῆς , οὐδ’ ἢν δέῃ τελευτῶντα τὴν ἑαυτοῦ στρωμνὴν ἐξαργυρῶσαι , τάς τε ἐν Ἀσπένδῳ ἤδη οὔσας Φοινίκων ναῦς κομιεῖν Ἀθηναίοις καὶ οὐ Πελοποννησίοις ·
" that Tissaphernes had pledged himself to him, that if he could but trust the Athenians, assuredly they should not want for supplies, so long as any of his own property remained, even though he should have at last to sell his own bed;


8.81.3
5858
πιστεῦσαι δ’ ἂν μόνως Ἀθηναίοις , εἰ σῶς αὐτὸς κατελθὼν αὐτῷ ἀναδέξαιτο .
and that he would bring the Phoenician ships which were now at Aspendus to join the Athenians, instead of the Peloponnesians; but he could only place confidence in the Athenians, if Alcibiades himself were recalled to be his security for them."


8.82.1
5859
οἱ δὲ ἀκούοντες ταῦτά τε καὶ ἄλλα πολλὰ στρατηγόν τε αὐτὸν εὐθὺς εἵλοντο μετὰ τῶν προτέρων καὶ τὰ πράγματα πάντα ἀνετίθεσαν , τήν τε παραυτίκα ἐλπίδα ἕκαστος τῆς τε σωτηρίας καὶ τῆς τῶν τετρακοσίων τιμωρίας οὐδενὸς ἂν ἠλλάξαντο , καὶ ἑτοῖμοι ἤδη ἦσαν διὰ τὸ αὐτίκα τούς τε παρόντας πολεμίους ἐκ τῶν λεχθέντων καταφρονεῖν καὶ πλεῖν ἐπὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ .
On hearing these and many other representations, they immediately elected him general in company with the former ones, and committed to him the whole management of their affairs. And now for nothing would they have exchanged their several hopes at the moment, both of preservation and of vengeance on the Four Hundred. Nay, they were at once ready immediately to despise their enemies on the spot, on the strength of what had been said, and to sail to the Piraeus.


8.82.2
5860
ὁ δὲ τὸ μὲν ἐπὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ πλεῖν τοὺς ἐγγυτέρω πολεμίους ὑπολιπόντας καὶ πάνυ διεκώλυσε , πολλῶν ἐπειγομένων , τὰ δὲ τοῦ πολέμου πρῶτον ἔφη , ἐπειδὴ καὶ στρατηγὸς ᾕρητο , πλεύσας ὡς Τισσαφέρνην πράξειν .
He, however, most positively forbad their sailing to the Piraeus, and leaving behind them their enemies who were so much closer at hand, though many were urgent for it, and told them that since he had been chosen their general, he would first of all sail to Tissaphernes, and arrange with him measures for the war.


8.82.3
5861
καὶ ἀπὸ ταύτης τῆς ἐκκλησίας εὐθὺς ᾤχετο , ἵνα δοκῇ πάντα μετ’ ἐκείνου κοινοῦσθαι , καὶ ἅμα βουλόμενος αὐτῷ τιμιώτερός τε εἶναι καὶ ἐνδείκνυσθαι ὅτι καὶ στρατηγὸς ἤδη ᾕρηται καὶ εὖ καὶ κακῶς οἷός τέ ἐστιν αὐτὸν ἤδη ποιεῖν .
And so, on leaving this assembly, he took his departure immediately, that he might be thought to communicate every thing to him;


8.82.3
5862
ξυνέβαινε δὲ τῷ Ἀλκιβιάδῃ τῷ μὲν Τισσαφέρνει τοὺς Ἀθηναίους φοβεῖν , ἐκείνοις δὲ τὸν Τισσαφέρνην .
at the same time that he wished to be more honoured by him, and to show him that he was now elected general, and was able to do him either good or harm. And thus it was the good fortune of Alcibiades to awe the Athenians by means of Tissaphernes, and Tissaphernes by means of them.


8.83.1
5863
οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ πυνθανόμενοι τὴν τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου κάθοδον , καὶ πρότερον τῷ Τισσαφέρνει ἀπιστοῦντες πολλῷ δὴ μᾶλλον ἔτι διεβέβληντο .
When the Peloponnesians at Miletus heard of the recall of Alcibiades, though they were before distrustful of Tissaphernes, they were now far more disgusted with him than ever.


8.83.2
5864
ξυνηνέχθη γὰρ αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὸν ἐπὶ τὴν Μίλητον τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπίπλουν , ὡς οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ἀνταναγαγόντες ναυμαχῆσαι , πολλῷ ἐς τὴν μισθοδοσίαν τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ἀρρωστότερον γενόμενον καὶ ἐς τὸ μισεῖσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτῶν πρότερον ἔτι τούτων διὰ τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην ἐπιδεδωκέναι .
For the truth was, that in the case of the Athenians advancing against Miletus, when the Peloponnesians would not put out to meet them and give them battle, Tissaphernes became far more sick of giving them pay; and indeed that he had even before this made some progress in their dislike, on account of Alcibiades.


8.83.3
5865
καὶ ξυνιστάμενοι κατ’ ἀλλήλους οἷάπερ καὶ πρότερον οἱ στρατιῶται ἀνελογίζοντο καί τινες καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν ἀξίων λόγου ἀνθρώπων καὶ οὐ μόνον τὸ στρατιωτικόν , ὡς οὔτε μισθὸν ἐντελῆ πώποτε λάβοιεν , τό τε διδόμενον βραχὺ καὶ οὐδὲ τοῦτο ξυνεχῶς ·
And so the soldiers, and some of the other men of consideration also, as well as the soldiery, clubbing together as before, began to reckon up their grievances;


8.83.3
5866
καὶ εἰ μή τις ἢ διαναυμαχήσει ἢ ἀπαλλάξεται ὅθεν τροφὴν ἕξει , ἀπολείψειν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τὰς ναῦς ·
namely, that they had never yet received their full pay; that what was now given them was deficient in amount, and not even that paid regularly;


8.83.3
5867
πάντων τε Ἀστύοχον εἶναι αἴτιον ἐπιφέροντα ὀργὰς Τισσαφέρνει διὰ ἴδια κέρδη .
that unless they either fought a decisive battle, or removed to some station where they might have supplies, the men would desert their ships; and that for all this Astyochus was to blame, through his humouring Tissaphernes for his own profit.


8.84.1
5868
ὄντων δ’ αὐτῶν ἐν τοιούτῳ ἀναλογισμῷ ξυνηνέχθη καὶ τοιόσδε τις θόρυβος περὶ τὸν Ἀστύοχον .
While they were thus reckoning up their grievances, the following disturbance also occurred about Astyochus.


8.84.2
5869
τῶν γὰρ Συρακοσίων καὶ Θουρίων ὅσῳ μάλιστα καὶ ἐλεύθεροι ἦσαν τὸ πλῆθος οἱ ναῦται , τοσούτῳ καὶ θρασύτατα προσπεσόντες τὸν μισθὸν ἀπῄτουν .
The Syracusan and Thurian seamen, inasmuch as they were, generally speaking, most free, applied to him also with the greatest boldness, and demanded their pay.


8.84.2
5870
ὁ δὲ αὐθαδέστερόν τέ τι ἀπεκρίνατο καὶ ἠπείλησε καὶ τῷ γε Δωριεῖ ξυναγορεύοντι τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ ναύταις καὶ ἐπανήρατο τὴν βακτηρίαν .
He answered them somewhat haughtily, and threatened them; and indeed against Dorieus, who was supporting the plea of his own seamen, he even lifted up his baton.


8.84.3
5871
τὸ δὲ πλῆθος τῶν στρατιωτῶν ὡς εἶδον , οἷα δὴ ναῦται , ὥρμησαν ἐκραγέντες ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀστύοχον ὥστε βάλλειν ·
When the mass of the armament saw this, sailor-like, they rushed in a rage upon Astyochus to strike him;


8.84.3
5872
ὁ δὲ προϊδὼν καταφεύγει ἐπὶ βωμόν τινα .
but he saw them in time, and fled for refuge to an altar.


8.84.3
5873
οὐ μέντοι ἐβλήθη γε , ἀλλὰ διελύθησαν ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων .
Notwithstanding their rage, therefore, he was not struck, but they were parted again.


8.84.4
5874
ἔλαβον δὲ καὶ τὸ ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ ἐνῳκοδομημένον τοῦ Τισσαφέρνους φρούριον οἱ Μιλήσιοι λάθρᾳ ἐπιπεσόντες , καὶ τοὺς ἐνόντας φύλακας αὐτοῦ ἐκβάλλουσιν ·
The Milesians also took the fort belonging to Tissaphernes which had been built in Miletus, having attacked it when unobserved, and drawn out of it the garrison that was in it.


8.84.4
5875
ξυνεδόκει δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ξυμμάχοις ταῦτα καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα τοῖς Συρακοσίοις .
And the rest of the confederates also approved of these things, and especially the Syracusans.


8.84.5
5876
ὁ μέντοι Λίχας οὔτε ἠρέσκετο αὐτοῖς ἔφη τε χρῆναι Τισσαφέρνει καὶ δουλεύειν Μιλησίους καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους τοὺς ἐν τῇ βασιλέως τὰ μέτρια καὶ ἐπιθεραπεύειν , ἕως ἂν τὸν πόλεμον εὖ θῶνται .
Lichas, however, was displeased with them, and said that the Milesians and the rest of the states in the king's country ought to submit to Tissaphernes, in such things as were reasonable, and to pay him court, until they had brought the war to a happy conclusion.


8.84.5
5877
οἱ δὲ Μιλήσιοι ὠργίζοντό τε αὐτῷ καὶ διὰ ταῦτα καὶ δι’ ἄλλα τοιουτότροπα καὶ νόσῳ ὕστερον ἀποθανόντα αὐτὸν οὐκ εἴασαν θάψαι οὗ ἐβούλοντο οἱ παρόντες τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων .
But the Milesians were offended with him for this, and other things of the same kind; and afterwards, when he had died of sickness, they would not allow them to bury him where those of the Lacedaemonians who were present wished to do.


8.85.1
5878
κατὰ δὴ τοιαύτην διαφορὰν ὄντων αὐτοῖς τῶν πραγμάτων πρός τε τὸν Ἀστύοχον καὶ τὸν Τισσαφέρνην Μίνδαρος διάδοχος τῆς Ἀστυόχου ναυαρχίας ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος ἐπῆλθε καὶ παραλαμβάνει τὴν ἀρχήν ·
When their affairs, then, were involved in these dissensions both with Astyochus and Tissaphernes, Mindarus arrived from Lacedaemon to succeed Astyochus as admiral, and assumed the command,


8.85.1
5879
ὁ δὲ Ἀστύοχος ἀπέπλει .
while Astyochus sailed away. With him Tissaphernes also sent, as an ambassador, one of his courtiers named Gaulites, a Carian who spoke two languages;


8.85.2
5880
ξυνέπεμψε δὲ καὶ Τισσαφέρνης αὐτῷ πρεσβευτὴν τῶν παρ’ ἑαυτοῦ , Γαυλίτην ὄνομα , Κᾶρα δίγλωσσον , κατηγορήσοντα τῶν τε Μιλησίων περὶ τοῦ φρουρίου καὶ περὶ αὐτοῦ ἅμα ἀπολογησόμενον , εἰδὼς τούς τε Μιλησίους πορευομένους ἐπὶ καταβοῇ τῇ αὑτοῦ μάλιστα καὶ τὸν Ἑρμοκράτη μετ’ αὐτῶν , ὃς ἔμελλε τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ἀποφαίνειν φθείροντα τῶν Πελοποννησίων τὰ πράγματα μετὰ Ἀλκιβιάδου καὶ ἐπαμφοτερίζοντα .
both to lay an accusation against the Milesians on the subject of the fort, and at the same time to make an apology for himself; for he knew that the Milesians were going thither chiefly to raise a clamour against him, and Hermocrates along with them, who intended to represent Tissaphernes as ruining the cause of the Peloponnesians in concert with Alcibiades, and pursuing a double policy.


8.85.3
5881
ἔχθρα δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἦν αὐτῷ αἰεί ποτε περὶ τοῦ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀποδόσεως ·
For he had always been at enmity with him about the payment of the money to the forces;


8.85.3
5882
καὶ τὰ τελευταῖα φυγόντος ἐκ Συρακουσῶν τοῦ Ἑρμοκράτους καὶ ἑτέρων ἡκόντων ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐς τὴν Μίλητον στρατηγῶν , Ποτάμιδος καὶ Μύσκωνος καὶ Δημάρχου , ἐνέκειτο ὁ Τισσαφέρνης φυγάδι ὄντι ἤδη τῷ Ἑρμοκράτει πολλῷ ἔτι μᾶλλον καὶ κατηγόρει ἄλλα τε καὶ ὡς χρήματά ποτε αἰτήσας αὑτὸν καὶ οὐ τυχὼν τὴν ἔχθραν οἱ προθοῖτο .
and at last, when Hermocrates was banished from Syracuse, and some others of the Syracusans, namely, Potamis, Myscon, and Demarchus, had come to Miletus to take command of the Syracusan ships, Tissaphernes pressed far more severely than ever on Hermocrates, when he was now an exile; both laying other things to his charge, and especially, that having once asked him for money and not obtained it, he displayed his enmity to him in consequence.


8.85.4
5883
ὁ μὲν οὖν Ἀστύοχος καὶ οἱ Μιλήσιοι καὶ ὁ Ἑρμοκράτης ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα .
Astyochus, then, with the Milesians and Hermocrates, sailed away to Lacedaemon;


8.85.4
5884
ὁ δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδης διεβεβήκει πάλιν ἤδη παρὰ τοῦ Τισσαφέρνους ἐς τὴν Σάμον .
while Alcibiades had by this time crossed over again from Tissaphernes to Samos.


8.86.1
5885
καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Δήλου ἀπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων πρεσβευταί , οὓς τότε ἔπεμψαν παραμυθησομένους καὶ ἀναδιδάξοντας τοὺς ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ , ἀφικνοῦνται παρόντος τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου , καὶ ἐκκλησίας γενομένης λέγειν ἐπεχείρουν .
And now the ambassadors from the Four Hundred, whom they sent at the time we mentioned to appease and inform those at Samos, arrived from Delos, after Alcibiades had come; and when an assembly had been called, they attempted to make a speech.


8.86.2
5886
οἱ δὲ στρατιῶται τὸ μὲν πρῶτον οὐκ ἤθελον ἀκούειν , ἀλλ’ ἀποκτείνειν ἐβόων τοὺς τὸν δῆμον καταλύοντας , ἔπειτα μέντοι μόλις ἡσυχάσαντες ἤκουσαν .
But the soldiers at first would not hear them, but cried out, that they should put to death those who were abolishing the democracy; afterwards, however, they were with difficulty calmed down, and gave them a hearing.


8.86.3
5887
οἱ δ’ ἀπήγγελλον ὡς οὔτε ἐπὶ διαφθορᾷ τῆς πόλεως ἡ μετάστασις γίγνοιτο , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ , οὔθ’ ἵνα τοῖς πολεμίοις παραδοθῇ ( ἐξεῖναι γάρ , ὅτε ἐσέβαλον ἤδη σφῶν ἀρχόντων , τοῦτο ποιῆσαι ) , τῶν τε πεντακισχιλίων ὅτι πάντες ἐν τῷ μέρει μεθέξουσιν , οἵ τε οἰκεῖοι αὐτῶν οὔθ’ ὑβρίζονται , ὥσπερ Χαιρέας διαβάλλων ἀπήγγειλεν , οὔτε κακὸν ἔχουσιν οὐδέν , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τοῖς σφετέροις αὐτῶν ἕκαστοι κατὰ χώραν μένουσιν .
They, then, delivered to them this message; " that it was neither for the destruction of the state that the recent change had been made, but for its preservation; nor in order that it might be delivered up to the enemy, (for they might have done that when they invaded the country during their government:) that all in their turn should share the privileges of the Five Thousand; and that their relatives were neither being outraged, as Chaereas had slanderously reported to them, nor suffering any harm, but remained as they were, each in the enjoyment of his property."


8.86.4
5888
ἄλλα τε πολλὰ εἰπόντων οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἐσήκουον , ἀλλ’ ἐχαλέπαινον καὶ γνώμας ἄλλοι ἄλλας ἔλεγον , μάλιστα δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ πλεῖν .
Though they made this and many other statements besides, they listened none the more favourably, but were angry, and expressed different opinions, though most generally, that they should sail to the Piraeus.


8.86.4
5889
καὶ δοκεῖ Ἀλκιβιάδης πρῶτον τότε καὶ οὐδενὸς ἔλασσον τὴν πόλιν ὠφελῆσαι ·
And on that occasion Alcibiades appeared to have benefited the state for the first time, and in a degree inferior to no one else.


8.86.4
5890
ὡρμημένων γὰρ τῶν ἐν Σάμῳ Ἀθηναίων πλεῖν ἐπὶ σφᾶς αὐτούς , ἐν ᾧ σαφέστατα Ἰωνίαν καὶ Ἑλλήσποντον εὐθὺς εἶχον οἱ πολέμιοι , κωλυτὴς γενέσθαι .
For when the Athenians at Samos were bent on sailing against their countrymen, in which case most certainly the enemy would have taken possession of Ionia and the Hellespont, he was the man who prevented them.


8.86.5
5891
καὶ ἐν τῷ τότε ἄλλος μὲν οὐδ’ ἂν εἷς ἱκανὸς ἐγένετο κατασχεῖν τὸν ὄχλον , ἐκεῖνος δὲ τοῦ τ’ ἐπίπλου ἔπαυσε καὶ τοὺς ἰδίᾳ τοῖς πρέσβεσιν ὀργιζομένους λοιδορῶν ἀπέτρεπεν .
Indeed on that emergency no one else would have been able to restrain the multitude. He, however, both made them desist from the attack, and silenced with rebukes those individuals who were on their own account most angry with the ambassadors.


8.86.6
5892
αὐτὸς δὲ ἀποκρινάμενος αὐτοῖς ἀπέπεμπεν , ὅτι τοὺς μὲν πεντακισχιλίους οὐ κωλύοι ἄρχειν , τοὺς μέντοι τετρακοσίους ἀπαλλάσσειν ἐκέλευεν αὐτοὺς καὶ καθιστάναι τὴν βουλὴν ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον , τοὺς πεντακοσίους ·
He then dismissed them with an answer from himself, " that he did not object to the Five Thousand being in power, but ordered them to depose the Four Hundred, and to establish the council of Five Hundred as before.


8.86.6
5893
εἰ δὲ ἐς εὐτέλειάν τι ξυντέτμηται ὥστε τοὺς στρατευομένους μᾶλλον ἔχειν τροφήν , πάνυ ἐπαινεῖν .
That if any retrenchment had been made with a view to economy, in order that those who were on service might be better provided with supplies, he entirely approved of it."


8.86.7
5894
καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐκέλευεν ἀντέχειν καὶ μηδὲν ἐνδιδόναι τοῖς πολεμίοις ·
" In other respects also he urged them to stand out, and not at all to submit to the enemy.


8.86.7
5895
πρὸς μὲν γὰρ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς σῳζομένης τῆς πόλεως πολλὴν ἐλπίδα εἶναι καὶ ξυμβῆναι , εἰ δὲ ἅπαξ τὸ ἕτερον σφαλήσεται , ἢ τὸ ἐν Σάμῳ ἢ ἐκεῖνοι , οὐδ’ ὅτῳ διαλλαγήσεταί τις ἔτι ἔσεσθαι .
For if only the state were preserved, there was great hope of their being reconciled to one another;"


8.86.8
5896
παρῆσαν δὲ καὶ Ἀργείων πρέσβεις , ἐπαγγελλόμενοι τῷ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων δήμῳ ὥστε βοηθεῖν ·
" but if either of the two parties were once destroyed, either that at Samos, or that at home, there would no longer be any one for them to be reconciled to."


8.86.8
5897
ὁ δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδης ἐπαινέσας αὐτοὺς καὶ εἰπὼν ὅταν τις καλῇ παρεῖναι οὕτως ἀπέπεμπεν .
There came also ambassadors from the Argives, with offers of assistance to the popular party of the Athenians at Samos;


8.86.9
5898
ἀφίκοντο δὲ οἱ Ἀργεῖοι μετὰ τῶν Παράλων , οἳ τότε ἐτάχθησαν ἐν τῇ στρατιώτιδι νηὶ ὑπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων περιπλεῖν Εὔβοιαν , καὶ ἄγοντες Ἀθηναίων ἐς Λακεδαίμονα ἀπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων πεμπτοὺς πρέσβεις , Λαισποδίαν καὶ Ἀριστοφῶντα καὶ Μελησίαν , οἳ ἐπειδὴ ἐγένοντο πλέοντες κατ’ Ἄργος , τοὺς μὲν πρέσβεις ξυλλαβόντες τοῖς Ἀργείοις παρέδοσαν ὡς τῶν οὐχ ἥκιστα καταλυσάντων τὸν δῆμον ὄντας , αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκέτι ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἀφίκοντο , ἀλλ’ ἄγοντες ἐκ τοῦ Ἄργους ἐς τὴν Σάμον τοὺς πρέσβεις ἀφικνοῦνται ᾗπερ εἶχον τριήρει .
but Alcibiades thanked them, and desiring them to come when they should be called upon, thus dismissed them. Now the Argives came in company with the crew of the Paralus, who, when last mentioned, had been commanded by the Four Hundred to cruise in the troop-ship round Euboea; and who, while taking to Lacedaemon some Athenians that had been sent as ambassadors by the Four Hundred, namely, Laespodias, Aristophon, and Melesias, when off Argos in their passage, seized the ambassadors, and delivered them up to the Argives, as being some of those who had been most instrumental in abolishing the democracy; while they themselves did not go to Athens again, but taking the ambassadors from Argos to Samos arrived there with the trireme they were in.


8.87.1
5899
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους Τισσαφέρνης , κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ἐν ᾧ μάλιστα διά τε τ- ἄλλα καὶ διὰ τὴν Ἀλκιβιάδου κάθοδον ἤχθοντο αὐτῷ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ὡς φανερῶς ἤδη ἀττικίζοντι , βουλόμενος , ὡς ἐδόκει δή , ἀπολύεσθαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὰς διαβολάς , παρεσκευάζετο πορεύεσθαι ἐπὶ τὰς Φοινίσσας ναῦς ἐς Ἄσπενδον , καὶ τὸν Λίχαν ξυμπορεύεσθαι ἐκέλευεν ·
The same summer, and at the very time when the Peloponnesians were most offended with Tissaphernes, both on other accounts, and especially because of the return of Alcibiades, thinking that he was now evidently Atticizing,


8.87.1
5900
τῇ δὲ στρατιᾷ προστάξειν ἔφη Τάμων ἑαυτοῦ ὕπαρχον , ὥστε τροφὴν ἐν ὅσῳ ἂν αὐτὸς ἀπῇ διδόναι .
he, wishing, as it seemed, to clear himself to them of these charges, prepared to go to Aspendus for the Phoenician ships, and desired Lichas to accompany him; saying, that with regard to the armament, he would appoint Tamos as his lieutenant, to furnish the supplies while he was himself absent.


8.87.2
5901
λέγεται δὲ οὐ κατὰ τ- αὐτό , οὐδὲ ῥᾴδιον εἰδέναι τίνι γνώμῃ παρῆλθεν ἐς τὴν Ἄσπενδον καὶ παρελθὼν οὐκ ἤγαγε τὰς ναῦς .
nor is it easy to decide with what motive he went to Aspendus, and yet, after going. did not bring the fleet. For it is certain that the Phoencician ships, a hundred and forty seven in number, came as far as Aspendus;


8.87.3
5902
ὅτι μὲν γὰρ αἱ Φοίνισσαι νῆες ἑπτὰ καὶ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν μέχρι Ἀσπένδου ἀφίκοντο σαφές ἐστι , διότι δὲ οὐκ ἦλθον πολλαχῇ εἰκάζεται .
For it is certain that the Phoenician ships, to the number of a hundred and forty-seven, arrived at Aspendus;


8.87.3
5903
οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἵνα διατρίβῃ ἀπελθών , ὥσπερ καὶ διενοήθη , τὰ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ( τροφὴν γοῦν οὐδὲν βέλτιον , ἀλλὰ καὶ χεῖρον ὁ Τάμως , ᾧ προσετάχθη , παρεῖχεν ) , οἱ δὲ ἵνα τοὺς Φοίνικας προαγαγὼν ἐς τὴν Ἄσπενδον ἐκχρηματίσαιτο ἀφείς ( καὶ γὰρ ὣς αὐτοῖς οὐδὲν ἔμελλε χρήσεσθαι ) , ἄλλοι δ’ ὡς καταβοῆς ἕνεκα τῆς ἐς Λακεδαίμονα , τοῦ λέγεσθαι ὡς οὐκ ἀδικεῖ , ἀλλὰ καὶ σαφῶς οἴχεται ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἀληθῶς πεπληρωμένας .
but why they did not come on, is a subject of many conjectures. For some think it was, that by going away he might, in accordance with his plan, wear down the power of the Peloponnesians; (at any rate Tamos, who was intrusted with the charge, provided them with supplies no better, but even worse, than himself.) Others, that after bringing the Phoenicians to Aspendus, he might exact money from them for their discharge; (for under no circumstances did he intend to employ them on any service.) Others, that it was on account of the clamour against him, which had spread to Lacedaemon—to have it said that he was not wronging them, but was certainly gone for the ships, which were undoubtedly manned for service.


8.87.4
5904
ἐμοὶ μέντοι δοκεῖ σαφέστατον εἶναι διατριβῆς ἕνεκα καὶ ἀνοκωχῆς τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν τὸ ναυτικὸν οὐκ ἀγαγεῖν , φθορᾶς μέν , ἐν ὅσῳ παρῄει ἐκεῖσε καὶ διέμελλεν , ἀνισώσεως δέ , ὅπως μηδετέροις προσθέμενος ἰσχυροτέρους ποιήσῃ , ἐπεί , εἴ γε ἐβουλήθη , διαπολεμῆσαι ἂν ἐπιφανεὶς δήπου οὐκ ἐνδοιαστῶς ·
To me, however, it appears most evident that it was with a view to wear out the Greeks, and to keep them in suspense, that he did not bring the fleet;


8.87.4
5905
κομίσας γὰρ ἂν Λακεδαιμονίοις τὴν νίκην κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἔδωκεν , οἵ γε καὶ ἐν τῷ παρόντι ἀντιπάλως μᾶλλον ἢ ὑποδεεστέρως τῷ ναυτικῷ ἀνθώρμουν .
to weaken them, during all the time that he was going there and delaying; and to keep them balanced, in order that he might make neither party too strong by joining them. For had he wished to bring the war to a conclusion, it is surely evident that he could have done it without any doubt. For by bringing the fleet he would in all probability have given the victory to the Lacedaemonians; since even at present they maintained their opposition with their navy, on terms of equality rather than of inferiority.


8.87.5
5906
καταφωρᾷ δὲ μάλιστα καὶ ἣν εἶπε πρόφασιν οὐ κομίσας τὰς ναῦς .
But what most clearly convicts him is the excuse which he alleged for not bringing the ships.


8.87.5
5907
ἔφη γὰρ αὐτὰς ἐλάσσους ἢ ὅσας βασιλεὺς ἔταξε ξυλλεγῆναι ·
For he said that they were fewer in number than the king had commanded to be collected.


8.87.5
5908
ὁ δὲ χάριν ἂν δήπου ἐν τούτῳ μείζω ἔτι ἔσχεν , οὔτ’ ἀναλώσας πολλὰ τῶν βασιλέως τά τε αὐτὰ ἀπ’ ἐλασσόνων πράξας .
But surely he would have gained still greater thanks by that, through not spending so much of the king's money, and yet effecting the same object at a less cost.


8.87.6
5909
ἐς δ’ οὖν τὴν Ἄσπενδον ᾑτινιδὴ γνώμῃ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης ἀφικνεῖται καὶ τοῖς Φοίνιξι ξυγγίγνεται ·
At any rate, with whatever intention it might have been, Tissaphernes went to Aspendus, and had an interview with the Phoenicians;


8.87.6
5910
καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἔπεμψαν ὡς ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς κελεύσαντος αὐτοῦ Φίλιππον ἄνδρα Λακεδαιμόνιον δύο τριήρεσιν .
and the Peloponnesians, by his desire, sent Philippus, a man of Lacedaemon, with two triremes to fetch the fleet.


8.88.1
5911
Ἀλκιβιάδης δὲ ἐπειδὴ καὶ τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ᾔσθετο παριόντα ἐπὶ τῆς Ἀσπένδου , ἔπλει καὶ αὐτὸς λαβὼν τρεῖς καὶ δέκα ναῦς , ὑποσχόμενος τοῖς ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ ἀσφαλῆ καὶ μεγάλην χάριν ( ἢ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἄξειν Ἀθηναίοις τὰς Φοινίσσας ναῦς ἢ Πελοποννησίοις γε κωλύσειν ἐλθεῖν ) , εἰδώς , ὡς εἰκός , ἐκ πλέονος τὴν Τισσαφέρνους γνώμην ὅτι οὐκ ἄξειν ἔμελλε , καὶ βουλόμενος αὐτὸν τοῖς Πελοποννησίοις ἐς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ καὶ Ἀθηναίων φιλίαν ὡς μάλιστα διαβάλλειν , ὅπως μᾶλλον δι’ αὐτὸ σφίσιν ἀναγκάζοιτο προσχωρεῖν .καὶ ὁ μὲν ἄρας εὐθὺ τῆς Φασήλιδος καὶ Καύνου ἄνω τὸν πλοῦν ἐποιεῖτο .
Alcibiades, on finding that Tissaphernes had gone to Aspendus, sailed thither himself also with thirteen ships, promising the forces at Samos a sure and great benefit; for that he would either himself bring the Phoenician fleet to the Athenians, or at any rate prevent its going to the Peloponnesians. For in all probability he had long known the purpose of Tissaphernes, that he did not intend fetching them, and wished to prejudice him as much as possible with the Peloponnesians, on the ground of his friendship for himself and the Athenians, that so he might be the more compelled to join the side of Athens. Accordingly he set sail and pursued his voyage upwards, straight for Phaselis and Caunus.


8.89.1
5912
οἱ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Σάμου ἀπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων πεμφθέντες πρέσβεις ἐπειδὴ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἀπήγγειλαν τὰ παρὰ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου , ὡς κελεύει τε ἀντέχειν καὶ μηδὲν ἐνδιδόναι τοῖς πολεμίοις , ἐλπίδας τε ὅτι πολλὰς ἔχει κ- ἐκείνοις τὸ στράτευμα διαλλάξειν καὶ Πελοποννησίων περιέσεσθαι , ἀχθομένους καὶ πρότερον τοὺς πολλοὺς τῶν μετεχόντων τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας καὶ ἡδέως ἂν ἀπαλλαγέντας πῃ ἀσφαλῶς τοῦ πράγματος πολλῷ δὴ μᾶλλον ἐπέρρωσαν .
When the ambassadors sent from the Four Hundred arrived at Athens from Samos, and delivered the message from Alcibiades, namely, that he begged them to hold out, and not submit at all to the enemy; and that he had great hopes of reconciling the army to those at home, and of getting the better of the Peloponnesians; they gave much more courage to the greater part of those implicated in the oligarchy, who had even before been discontented with it, and would gladly have been quit of the business by any safe means.


8.89.2
5913
καὶ ξυνίσταντό τε ἤδη καὶ τὰ πράγματα διεμέμφοντο , ἔχοντες ἡγεμόνας τῶν πάνυ στρατηγῶν τῶν ἐν τῇ ὀλιγαρχίᾳ καὶ ἐν ἀρχαῖς ὄντων , οἷον Θηραμένη τε τὸν Ἅγνωνος καὶ Ἀριστοκράτη τὸν Σκελίου καὶ ἄλλους , οἳ μετέσχον μὲν ἐν τοῖς πρῶτοι τῶν πραγμάτων , φοβούμενοι δέ , ὡς ἔφασαν , τό τε ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ στράτευμα καὶ τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδην σπουδῇ πάνυ , τούς τε ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πρεσβευομένους ἔπεμπον , μή τι ἄνευ τῶν πλεόνων κακὸν δράσωσι τὴν πόλιν , οὐ τὸ † ἀπαλλαξείειν τοῦ ἄγαν ἐς ὀλίγους ἐλθεῖν , ἀλλὰ τοὺς πεντακισχιλίους ἔργῳ καὶ μὴ ὀνόματι χρῆναι ἀποδεικνύναι καὶ τὴν πολιτείαν ἰσαιτέραν καθιστάναι .
Accordingly they now united, and found fault with the present state of things, having as their leaders some of the most influential generals and men in office, such as Theramenes the son of Hagnon, Aristocrates the son of Scellias, and others; who, though amongst the first members of the government, were yet afraid, as they alleged, of the army at Samos, and of Alcibiades most especially, as also of those whom they were sending as ambassadors to Lacedaemon, lest without the authority of the greater part of them they might do the state some harm; and so they declared, not that they wished to escape from the administration falling into too few hands, but that they ought to establish the Five Thousand in reality, not in mere name, and to settle the government on a more equal basis.


8.89.3
5914
ἦν δὲ τοῦτο μὲν σχῆμα πολιτικὸν τοῦ λόγου αὐτοῖς , κατ’ ἰδίας δὲ φιλοτιμίας οἱ πολλοὶ αὐτῶν τῷ τοιούτῳ προσέκειντο , ἐν ᾧπερ καὶ μάλιστα ὀλιγαρχία ἐκ δημοκρατίας γενομένη ἀπόλλυται ·
This, however, was but a public profession made by them in word; but it was from private ambition that most of them pursued that very method by which an oligarchy formed out of a democracy is most sure to be overturned.


8.89.3
5915
πάντες γὰρ αὐθημερὸν ἀξιοῦσιν οὐχ ὅπως ἴσοι , ἀλλὰ καὶ πολὺ πρῶτος αὐτὸς ἕκαστος εἶναι ·
For all at once not only claim to be equal, but every one decidedly the first man.


8.89.3
5916
ἐκ δὲ δημοκρατίας αἱρέσεως γιγνομένης ῥᾷον τὰ ἀποβαίνοντα ὡς οὐκ ἀπὸ τῶν ὁμοίων ἐλασσούμενός τις φέρει .
And in such a case failure is intolerable: whereas, when an election is made under a democracy, a man more easily submits to the result, as he does not think himself beaten on equal terms.


8.89.4
5917
σαφέστατα δ’ αὐτοὺς ἐπῆρε τὰ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἰσχυρὰ ὄντα καὶ ὅτι αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἐδόκει μόνιμον τὸ τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας ἔσεσθαι ·
But what most evidently encouraged them was the interest of Alcibiades being so strong in the army, and their not thinking that the power of the oligarchy would be permanent.


8.89.4
5918
ἠγωνίζετο οὖν εἷς ἕκαστος αὐτὸς πρῶτος προστάτης τοῦ δήμου γενέσθαι .
Each one therefore strove to be himself the first to take the lead of the commons.


8.90.1
5919
οἱ δὲ τῶν τετρακοσίων μάλιστα ἐναντίοι ὄντες τῷ τοιούτῳ εἴδει καὶ προεστῶτες Φρύνιχός τε , ὃς καὶ στρατηγήσας ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ ποτὲ τῷ Ἀλκιβιάδῃ τότε διηνέχθη , καὶ Ἀρίσταρχος , ἀνὴρ ἐν τοῖς μάλιστα καὶ ἐκ πλείστου ἐναντίος τῷ δήμῳ , καὶ Πείσανδρος καὶ Ἀντιφῶν καὶ ἄλλοι οἱ δυνατώτατοι , πρότερόν τε , ἐπεὶ τάχιστα κατέστησαν καὶ ἐπειδὴ τὰ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ σφῶν ἐς δημοκρατίαν ἀπέστη , πρέσβεις τε ἀπέστελλον σφῶν ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα καὶ τὴν ὁμολογίαν προυθυμοῦντο καὶ τὸ ἐν τῇ Ἠετιωνείᾳ καλουμένῃ τεῖχος ἐποιοῦντο , πολλῷ τε μᾶλλον ἔτι , ἐπειδὴ καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Σάμου πρέσβεις σφῶν ἦλθον , ὁρῶντες τούς τε πολλοὺς καὶ σφῶν τοὺς δοκοῦντας πρότερον πιστοὺς εἶναι μεταβαλλομένους .
But those of the Four Hundred who were most opposed to such a form of government, and who now took the lead, namely, Phrynichus, (who when general at Samos had quarrelled, as already mentioned, with Alcibiades;) and Aristarchus, a man in the highest degree and for the longest opposed to democracy; and Pisander, and Antiphon, and others who were most influential, had before—as soon as they were established in power, and afterwards, when the forces at Samos revolted from them for a democracy—sent members of their body as ambassadors to Lacedaemon, and been very anxious for peace with them, and been engaged in building the fort in what is called Eetionia. And far more than ever was this the case, after their ambassadors from Samos had arrived; seeing, as they did, that both the majority of the people, and those of their own members, who before appeared trustworthy, were now changing their views.


8.90.2
5920
καὶ ἀπέστειλαν μὲν Ἀντιφῶντα καὶ Φρύνιχον καὶ ἄλλους δέκα κατὰ τάχος , φοβούμενοι καὶ τὰ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ἐκ τῆς Σάμου , ἐπιστείλαντες παντὶ τρόπῳ ὅστις καὶ ὁπωσοῦν ἀνεκτὸς ξυναλλαγῆναι πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους , ᾠκοδόμουν δὲ ἔτι προθυμότερον τὸ ἐν τῇ Ἠετιωνείᾳ τεῖχος .
And so they despatched Antiphon, Phrynichus, and ten others with all speed, (for they were afraid of what was going on both at home and at Samos,) with instructions to make terms with the Lacedaemonians in any way whatever that was at all tolerable.


8.90.3
5921
ἦν δὲ τοῦ τείχους ἡ γνώμη αὕτη , ὡς ἔφη Θηραμένης καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ , οὐχ ἵνα τοὺς ἐν Σάμῳ , ἢν βίᾳ ἐπιπλέωσι , μὴ δέξωνται ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ , ἀλλ’ ἵνα τοὺς πολεμίους μᾶλλον , ὅταν βούλωνται , καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ πεζῷ δέξωνται .
And they worked with still greater earnestness at the fort in Eetionia. Now the object of the fort, as Theramenes and his party maintained, was this; not that they might avoid admitting the army at Samos into the Piraeus, should they attempt to sail in by force; but rather that they might admit the enemy, whenever they pleased, both with ships and troops. For Eetionia is a mole of the Piraeus, and the entrance into the harbour is straight by it.


8.90.4
5922
χηλὴ γάρ ἐστι τοῦ Πειραιῶς ἡ Ἠετιωνεία , καὶ παρ’ αὐτὴν εὐθὺς ὁ ἔσπλους ἐστίν .
It was being fortified therefore in such a manner, in connection with the wall previously existing on the land side, that, with only a few men posted in it, it would command the entrance.


8.90.4
5923
ἐτειχίζετο οὖν οὕτω ξὺν τῷ πρότερον πρὸς ἤπειρον ὑπάρχοντι τείχει , ὥστε καθεζομένων ἐς αὐτὸ ἀνθρώπων ὀλίγων ἄρχειν τοῦ ἔσπλου ·ἐπ’ αὐτὸν γὰρ τὸν ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ λιμένος στενοῦ ὄντος τὸν ἕτερον πύργον ἐτελεύτα τό τε παλαιὸν τὸ πρὸς ἤπειρον καὶ τὸ ἐντὸς τὸ καινὸν τεῖχος τειχιζόμενον πρὸς θάλασσαν .
For in the very tower standing on one of the two sides, at the mouth of the harbour, which was narrow, was the termination both of the original wall on the land side, and of the new and inner one which was being built on the side of the sea.


8.90.5
5924
διῳκοδόμησαν δὲ καὶ στοάν , ἥπερ ἦν μεγίστη καὶ ἐγγύτατα τούτου εὐθὺς ἐχομένη ἐν τῷ Πειραιεῖ , καὶ ἦρχον αὐτοὶ αὐτῆς , ἐς ἣν καὶ τὸν σῖτον ἠνάγκαζον πάντας τὸν ὑπάρχοντά τε καὶ τὸν ἐσπλέοντα ἐξαιρεῖσθαι καὶ ἐντεῦθεν προαιροῦντας πωλεῖν .
They also built a portico, which was very large and in immediate connexion with this wall in the Piraeus; of which they themselves had the command, and in which they compelled all to deposit both what corn they had before and what was now brought in, and to take it out thence when they sold it.


8.91.1
5925
ταῦτ’ οὖν ἐκ πλέονός τε ὁ Θηραμένης διεθρόει καὶ ἐπειδὴ οἱ ἐκ τῆς Λακεδαίμονος πρέσβεις οὐδὲν πράξαντες ἀνεχώρησαν τοῖς ξύμπασι ξυμβατικόν , φάσκων κινδυνεύσειν τὸ τεῖχος τοῦτο καὶ τὴν πόλιν διαφθεῖραι .
On these subjects, then, Theramenes had long been murmuring; and ever since the ambassadors had returned from Lacedaemon without effecting any general arrangement for them, he did so still more, saying that there would be danger of this fort's proving the ruin of the city.


8.91.2
5926
ἅμα γὰρ καὶ ἐκ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἐτύγχανον Εὐβοέων ἐπικαλουμένων κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον τοῦτον δύο καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νῆες , ὧν ἦσαν καὶ ἐκ Τάραντος καὶ Λοκρῶν Ἰταλιώτιδες καὶ Σικελικαί τινες , ὁρμοῦσαι ἤδη ἐπὶ Λᾷ τῆς Λακωνικῆς καὶ παρασκευαζόμεναι τὸν ἐς τὴν Εὔβοιαν πλοῦν ( ἦρχε δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀγησανδρίδας Ἀγησάνδρου Σπαρτιάτης ) ·
For some ships from the Peloponnese, whose aid the Euboeans had invited, to the number of two and forty, including some Italian and Sicilian vessels from Tarentum and Locri, also happened to be now lying off Las, in Laconia, and preparing for their passage to Euboea, under the command of Agesandridas son of Agesander, a Spartan.


8.91.2
5927
ἃς ἔφη Θηραμένης οὐκ Εὐβοίᾳ μᾶλλον ἢ τοῖς τειχίζουσι τὴν Ἠετιωνείαν προσπλεῖν , καὶ εἰ μή τις ἤδη φυλάξεται , λήσειν διαφθαρέντας .
These Theramenes declared to be sailing, not so much to the aid of Euboea, as of those who were fortifying Eetionia; and that if they were not on their guard now, they would be lost before they were aware of it.


8.91.3
5928
ἦν δέ τι καὶ τοιοῦτον ἀπὸ τῶν τὴν κατηγορίαν ἐχόντων , καὶ οὐ πάνυ διαβολὴ μόνον τοῦ λόγου .
And there really was some plan of this kind entertained by those who were charged with it, and it was not merely a verbal misrepresentation.


8.91.3
5929
ἐκεῖνοι γὰρ μάλιστα μὲν ἐβούλοντο ὀλιγαρχούμενοι ἄρχειν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων , εἰ δὲ μή , τάς τε ναῦς καὶ τὰ τείχη ἔχοντες αὐτονομεῖσθαι , ἐξειργόμενοι δὲ καὶ τούτου μὴ οὖν ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου γε αὖθις γενομένου αὐτοὶ πρὸ τῶν ἄλλων μάλιστα διαφθαρῆναι , ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους ἐσαγαγόμενοι ἄνευ τειχῶν καὶ νεῶν ξυμβῆναι καὶ ὁπωσοῦν τὰ τῆς πόλεως ἔχειν , εἰ τοῖς γε σώμασι σφῶν ἄδεια ἔσται .
For it was the wish of that party, if possible, to retain their dominion over the allies with an oligarchical government; if not, to retain their independence, with the possession of their ships and walls; but if excluded from that also, at any rate not to perish themselves under the restored democracy before and above all others, but even to call in the enemy, and without walls and ships to make peace with them, and retain the government of the city on any terms whatever, if they had only security for their persons.


8.92.1
5930
διόπερ καὶ τὸ τεῖχος τοῦτο καὶ πυλίδας ἔχον καὶ ἐσόδους καὶ ἐπεσαγωγὰς τῶν πολεμίων ἐτείχιζόν τε προθύμως καὶ φθῆναι ἐβούλοντο ἐξεργασάμενοι .
For this reason they were also diligently raising this fortification, with both posterns and entrances, and facilities for introducing the enemy, and were desirous to have it completed in time.


8.92.2
5931
πρότερον μὲν οὖν κατ’ ὀλίγους τε καὶ κρύφα μᾶλλον τὰ λεγόμενα ἦν ·
Now what was said of them was previously advanced in small parties only, and with greater secrecy;


8.92.2
5932
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ὁ Φρύνιχος ἥκων ἐκ τῆς ἐς Λακεδαίμονα πρεσβείας πληγεὶς ὑπ’ ἀνδρὸς τῶν περιπόλων τινὸς ἐξ ἐπιβουλῆς ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ πληθούσῃ καὶ οὐ πολὺ ἀπὸ τοῦ βουλευτηρίου ἀπελθὼν ἀπέθανε παραχρῆμα , καὶ ὁ μὲν πατάξας διέφυγεν , ὁ δὲ ξυνεργὸς Ἀργεῖος ἄνθρωπος ληφθεὶς καὶ βασανιζόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων οὐδενὸς ὄνομα τοῦ κελεύσαντος εἶπεν οὐδὲ ἄλλο τι ἢ ὅτι εἰδείη πολλοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ ἐς τοῦ περιπολάρχου καὶ ἄλλοσε κατ’ οἰκίας ξυνιόντας , τότε δὴ οὐδενὸς γεγενημένου ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ νεωτέρου καὶ ὁ Θηραμένης ἤδη θρασύτερον καὶ Ἀριστοκράτης καὶ ὅσοι ἄλλοι τῶν τετρακοσίων αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ἔξωθεν ἦσαν ὁμογνώμονες ᾖσαν ἐπὶ τὰ πράγματα .
but when Phrynichus, on his return from the embassy to Lacedaemon, had been designedly stabbed in the full market by a man who served in the , and after proceeding but a short distance from the council-chamber expired immediately, and the assassin escaped; while his accomplice, who was an Argive, though seized and tortured by the Four Hundred, mentioned no one's name as having instigated him to it, nor anything else, but that he knew many men assembled in different houses, both that of the commander of the and others;


8.92.3
5933
ἅμα γὰρ καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Λᾶς αἱ νῆες ἤδη περιπεπλευκυῖαι καὶ ὁρμισάμεναι ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαυρον τὴν Αἴγιναν κατεδεδραμήκεσαν ·
At this same time the ships had now sailed round from Las, and after coming to anchor at Epidaurus, had overrun Aegina;


8.92.3
5934
καὶ οὐκ ἔφη ὁ Θηραμένης εἰκὸς εἶναι ἐπ’ Εὔβοιαν πλεούσας αὐτὰς ἐς Αἴγιναν κατακολπίσαι καὶ πάλιν ἐν Ἐπιδαύρῳ ὁρμεῖν , εἰ μὴ παρακληθεῖσαι ἥκοιεν ἐφ’ οἷσπερ καὶ αὐτὸς αἰεὶ κατηγόρει ·
and Theramenes remarked, that it was not probable that, while on their passage to Euboea, they should have run into the bay, and be lying again at Epidaurus, unless they had been invited, and come for the purposes with which he had all along been charging them;


8.92.3
5935
οὐκέτι οὖν οἷόν τε εἶναι ἡσυχάζειν .
and therefore it was not possible any longer to remain quiet.


8.92.4
5936
τέλος δὲ πολλῶν καὶ στασιωτικῶν λόγων καὶ ὑποψιῶν προσγενομένων καὶ ἔργῳ ἤδη ἥπτοντο τῶν πραγμάτων ·
At length, after many more seditious speeches and suspicions had been uttered, they now proceeded to business in real earnest.


8.92.4
5937
οἱ γὰρ ἐν τῷ Πειραιεῖ τὸ τῆς Ἠετιωνείας τεῖχος ὁπλῖται οἰκοδομοῦντες , ἐν οἷς καὶ ὁ Ἀριστοκράτης ἦν ταξιαρχῶν καὶ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ φυλὴν ἔχων , ξυλλαμβάνουσιν Ἀλεξικλέα στρατηγὸν ὄντα ἐκ τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας καὶ μάλιστα πρὸς τοὺς ἑταίρους τετραμμένον , καὶ ἐς οἰκίαν ἀγαγόντες εἶρξαν .
For the heavy-armed who were in the Piraeus, building the wall in Eetionia, amongst whom also was Aristocrates a taxiarch, with his company, arrested Alexicles, who was a general on the side of the oligarchy, and very favourably inclined to the associates, and taking him into a house confined him there.


8.92.5
5938
ξυνεπελάβοντο δὲ αὐτοῖς ἅμα καὶ ἄλλοι καὶ Ἕρμων τις τῶν περιπόλων τῶν Μουνιχίασι τεταγμένων ἄρχων ·
There were others who assisted them in this, and particularly one Hermon, commander of the stationed in Munychia;


8.92.5
5939
τὸ δὲ μέγιστον , τῶν ὁπλιτῶν τὸ στῖφος ταῦτα ἐβούλετο .
and, what was of most importance, the mass of the heavy-armed were in favour of these measures.


8.92.6
5940
ὡς δὲ ἐσηγγέλθη τοῖς τετρακοσίοις ( ἔτυχον δὲ ἐν τῷ βουλευτηρίῳ ξυγκαθήμενοι ) , εὐθύς , πλὴν ὅσοις μὴ βουλομένοις ταῦτ’ ἦν , ἑτοῖμοι ἦσαν ἐς τὰ ὅπλα ἰέναι καὶ τῷ Θηραμένει καὶ τοῖς μετ’ αὐτοῦ ἠπείλουν .
When this news reached the Four Hundred, (who happened to be sitting together in their council-chamber,) immediately, with the exception of such as did not approve of the present government, they were prepared forthwith to arm themselves, and threatened Theramenes and those with him.


8.92.6
5941
ὁ δὲ ἀπολογούμενος ἑτοῖμος ἔφη εἶναι ξυναφαιρησόμενος ἰέναι ἤδη .
He, however, said in his defence that he was ready to go at once and assist in rescuing Alexicles;


8.92.6
5942
καὶ παραλαβὼν ἕνα τῶν στρατηγῶν ὃς ἦν αὐτῷ ὁμογνώμων ἐχώρει ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ ·
and taking with him one of the generals who held the same views with himself, he proceeded to the Piraeus;


8.92.6
5943
ἐβοήθει δὲ καὶ Ἀρίσταρχος καὶ τῶν ἱππέων νεανίσκοι .
while Aristarchus and some young men of the cavalry went to the rescue.


8.92.7
5944
ἦν δὲ θόρυβος πολὺς καὶ ἐκπληκτικός ·
The tumult, then, was great and alarming:


8.92.7
5945
οἵ τε γὰρ ἐν τῷ ἄστει ἤδη ᾤοντο τόν τε Πειραιᾶ κατειλῆφθαι καὶ τὸν ξυνειλημμένον τεθνάναι , οἵ τε ἐν τῷ Πειραιεῖ τοὺς ἐκ τοῦ ἄστεως ὅσον οὔπω ἐπὶ σφᾶς παρεῖναι .
for those in the city thought that the Piraeus was already taken, and the general under arrest put to death; while those in the Piraeus believed that the men in the city were all but attacking them.


8.92.8
5946
μόλις δὲ τῶν τε πρεσβυτέρων διακωλυόντων τοὺς ἐν τῷ ἄστει διαθέοντας καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ὅπλα φερομένους καὶ Θουκυδίδου τοῦ Φαρσαλίου τοῦ προξένου τῆς πόλεως παρόντος καὶ προθύμως ἐμποδών τε ἑκάστοις γιγνομένου καὶ ἐπιβοωμένου μὴ ἐφεδρευόντων ἐγγὺς τῶν πολεμίων ἀπολέσαι τὴν πατρίδα , ἡσύχασάν τε καὶ σφῶν αὐτῶν ἀπέσχοντο .
while Thucydides the Pharsalian, the Proxenus of the state, was also present, and earnestly opposed the several parties, calling upon them not to destroy their country while the enemy were still waiting to attack them; they were with difficulty quieted and forbore from attacking one another. Now when Theramenes came into the Piraeus, (for he too was one of the generals,) as far as shouting went, he was angry with the soldiers;


8.92.9
5947
καὶ ὁ μὲν Θηραμένης ἐλθὼν ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ ( ἦν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς στρατηγός ) , ὅσον καὶ ἀπὸ βοῆς ἕνεκα , ὠργίζετο τοῖς ὁπλίταις ·
But when the elder men stopped those in the city who were running about, and rushing to the stands of arms;


8.92.9
5948
ὁ δὲ Ἀρίσταρχος καὶ οἱ ἐναντίοι τῷ ἀληθεῖ ἐχαλέπαινον .
but Aristarchus and those who were opposed to the popular party were in a violent rage.


8.92.10
5949
οἱ δὲ ὁπλῖται ὁμόσε τε ἐχώρουν οἱ πλεῖστοι τῷ ἔργῳ καὶ οὐ μετεμέλοντο , καὶ τὸν Θηραμένη ἠρώτων εἰ δοκεῖ αὐτῷ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ τὸ τεῖχος οἰκοδομεῖσθαι καὶ εἰ ἄμεινον εἶναι καθαιρεθέν .
Most of the soldiers however joined in the work, without changing their purpose, and asked Theramenes, whether he thought that the wall was being built for any good, or would be better demolished.


8.92.10
5950
ὁ δέ , εἴπερ καὶ ἐκείνοις δοκεῖ καθαιρεῖν , καὶ ἑαυτῷ ἔφη ξυνδοκεῖν .
He said, that if they thought right to demolish it, he also agreed with them.


8.92.10
5951
καὶ ἐντεῦθεν εὐθὺς ἀναβάντες οἵ τε ὁπλῖται καὶ πολλοὶ τῶν ἐκ τοῦ Πειραιῶς ἀνθρώπων κατέσκαπτον τὸ τείχισμα .
Upon that both the soldiers and many of the men in the Piraeus immediately mounted, and began to pull down the fortification.


8.92.11
5952
ἦν δὲ πρὸς τὸν ὄχλον ἡ παράκλησις ὡς χρή , ὅστις τοὺς πεντακισχιλίους βούλεται ἄρχειν ἀντὶ τῶν τετρακοσίων , ἰέναι ἐπὶ τὸ ἔργον .
And the cry for the encouragement of the multitude was this; " that whoever wished the Five Thousand to rule instead of the Four Hundred, must go to help in the work."


8.92.11
5953
ἐπεκρύπτοντο γὰρ ὅμως ἔτι τῶν πεντακισχιλίων τῷ ὀνόματι , μὴ ἄντικρυς δῆμον ὅστις βούλεται ἄρχειν ὀνομάζειν , φοβούμενοι μὴ τῷ ὄντι ὦσι καὶ πρός τινα εἰπών τίς τι ἀγνοίᾳ σφαλῇ .
For they continued, notwithstanding, to conceal their real views under the name of the Five Thousand, so that whoever wished the commons to hold the government did not expressly mention that word; fearing that the Five Thousand might really have been elected, and that so by saying something to one [who belonged to that body,] he might, through his ignorance of the fact, commit himself.


8.92.11
5954
καὶ οἱ τετρακόσιοι διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἤθελον τοὺς πεντακισχιλίους οὔτε εἶναι οὔτε μὴ ὄντας δήλους εἶναι , τὸ μὲν καταστῆσαι μετόχους τοσούτους ἄντικρυς ἂν δῆμον ἡγούμενοι , τὸ δ’ αὖ ἀφανὲς φόβον ἐς ἀλλήλους παρέξειν .
And, indeed, for this reason the Four Hundred neither wished the Five Thousand to be elected, nor to have it known that they were not; thinking, on the one hand, that to install so many partners with them would amount to a downright democracy; and, on the other hand, that uncertainty on the subject would strike them with fear of one another.


8.93.1
5955
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ οἱ μὲν τετρακόσιοι ἐς τὸ βουλευτήριον ὅμως καὶ τεθορυβημένοι ξυνελέγοντο ·
The next day the Four Hundred, although alarmed, assembled nevertheless in their council-chamber;


8.93.1
5956
οἱ δ’ ἐν τῷ Πειραιεῖ ὁπλῖται τόν τε Ἀλεξικλέα ὃν ξυνέλαβον ἀφέντες καὶ τὸ τείχισμα καθελόντες ἐς τὸ πρὸς τῇ Μουνιχίᾳ Διονυσιακὸν θέατρον ἐλθόντες καὶ θέμενοι τὰ ὅπλα ἐξεκλησίασαν , καὶ δόξαν αὐτοῖς εὐθὺς ἐχώρουν ἐς τὸ ἄστυ καὶ ἔθεντο αὖ ἐν τῷ Ἀνακείῳ τὰ ὅπλα .
while the soldiers in the Piraeus, after releasing Alexicles, whom they had arrested, and demolishing the fortification, came to the temple of Bacchus close to Munychia, and having piled their arms, held an assembly there out of the usual place; and in accordance with a resolution made by them, proceeded straightway to the city, and piled their arms in the Anaceum.


8.93.2
5957
ἐλθόντες δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων τινὲς ᾑρημένοι πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἀνὴρ ἀνδρὶ διελέγοντό τε καὶ ἔπειθον οὓς ἴδοιεν ἀνθρώπους ἐπιεικεῖς αὐτούς τε ἡσυχάζειν καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους παρακατέχειν , λέγοντες τούς τε πεντακισχιλίους ἀποφανεῖν , καὶ ἐκ τούτων ἐν μέρει ᾗ ἂν τοῖς πεντακισχιλίοις δοκῇ τοὺς τετρακοσίους ἔσεσθαι , τέως δὲ τὴν πόλιν μηδενὶ τρόπῳ διαφθείρειν μηδ’ ἐς τοὺς πολεμίους ἀνῶσαι .
But when certain chosen deputies from the Four Hundred came to them, they conversed man with man, and such as they saw to be men of moderate views they persuaded both to remain quiet themselves, and to restrain the rest; telling them that they would publish the names of the Five Thousand, and that from these the Four Hundred should be elected in rotation, in such a manner as the Five Thousand might think fit: but, in the mean time, they begged them by no means to destroy the city, or drive it into the hands of the enemy.


8.93.3
5958
τὸ δὲ πᾶν πλῆθος τῶν ὁπλιτῶν ἀπὸ πολλῶν καὶ πρὸς πολλοὺς λόγων γιγνομένων ἠπιώτερον ἦν ἢ πρότερον καὶ ἐφοβεῖτο μάλιστα περὶ τοῦ παντὸς πολιτικοῦ ·
So the whole body of the soldiers, when such addresses were made by many and to many, were more pacified than before, and most alarmed for the whole state;


8.93.3
5959
ξυνεχώρησάν τε ὥστε ἐς ἡμέραν ῥητὴν ἐκκλησίαν ποιῆσαι ἐν τῷ Διονυσίῳ περὶ ὁμονοίας .
and they agreed to hold, on an appointed day, an assembly in the temple of Bacchus, with a view to restoring concord.


8.94.1
5960
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐπῆλθεν ἡ ἐν Διονύσου ἐκκλησία καὶ ὅσον οὐ ξυνειλεγμένοι ἦσαν , ἀγγέλλονται αἱ δύο καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νῆες καὶ ὁ Ἀγησανδρίδας ἀπὸ τῶν Μεγάρων τὴν Σαλαμῖνα παραπλεῖν ·
When the day for holding the assembly was come, and they had all but met, news were brought that the two and forty ships with Agesander were advancing from Megara along the coast of Salamis;


8.94.1
5961
καὶ πᾶς τις τῶν πολλῶν ὁπλιτῶν αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι τὸ πάλαι λεγόμενον ὑπὸ Θηραμένους καὶ τῶν μετ’ αὐτοῦ , ὡς ἐς τὸ τείχισμα ἔπλεον αἱ νῆες , καὶ χρησίμως ἐδόκει καταπεπτωκέναι .
and every one of the soldiers in general considered this to be the very thing which had so long been asserted by Theramenes and his party, namely, that it was to the fort that the ships were sailing; and it appeared to have been thrown down to good purpose.


8.94.2
5962
ὁ δὲ Ἀγησανδρίδας τάχα μέν τι καὶ ἀπὸ ξυγκειμένου λόγου περί τε τὴν Ἐπίδαυρον καὶ ταύτῃ ἀνεστρέφετο , εἰκὸς δ’ αὐτὸν καὶ πρὸς τὸν παρόντα στασιασμὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων , δι’ ἐλπίδος ὡς κἂν ἐς δέον παραγένοιτο , ταύτῃ ἀνέχειν .
And it  perhaps, in some measure have been by appointment that Agesandridas lingered about Epidaurus and that neighbourhood; though it is also probable that he stayed there in consequence of the present sedition amongst the Athenians, in hope of coming up at the moment favourable for action.


8.94.3
5963
οἱ δ’ αὖ Ἀθηναῖοι , ὡς ἠγγέλθη αὐτοῖς , εὐθὺς δρόμῳ ἐς τὸν Πειραιᾶ πανδημεὶ ἐχώρουν , ὡς τοῦ ἰδίου πολέμου μείζονος ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων οὐχ ἑκάς , ἀλλὰ πρὸς τῷ λιμένι ὄντος .
But the Athenians, on the other hand, on receiving this intelligence, immediately ran down in full force to the Piraeus, considering that a war with the enemy, of greater importance than that amongst themselves, was threatening them at no great distance, but close to their harbour.


8.94.3
5964
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐς τὰς παρούσας ναῦς ἐσέβαινον , οἱ δὲ ἄλλας καθεῖλκον , οἱ δέ τινες ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη καὶ τὸ στόμα τοῦ λιμένος παρεβοήθουν .
Some of them therefore went on board the ships that were already afloat; others launched additional ones; and some others ran to the defence of the walls and the mouth of the harbour.


8.95.1
5965
αἱ δὲ τῶν Πελοποννησίων νῆες παραπλεύσασαι καὶ περιβαλοῦσαι Σούνιον ὁρμίζονται μεταξὺ Θορικοῦ τε καὶ Πρασιῶν , ὕστερον δὲ ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς Ὠρωπόν .
But the Peloponnesian ships, after sailing by and doubling Sunium, came to anchor between Thoricus and Prasiae, and subsequently went to Oropus.


8.95.2
5966
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ κατὰ τάχος καὶ ἀξυγκροτήτοις πληρώμασιν ἀναγκασθέντες χρήσασθαι , οἷα πόλεώς τε στασιαζούσης καὶ περὶ τοῦ μεγίστου ἐν τάχει βουλόμενοι βοηθῆσαι ( Εὔβοια γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἀποκεκλῃμένης τῆς Ἀττικῆς πάντα ἦν ) , πέμπουσι Θυμοχάρη στρατηγὸν καὶ ναῦς ἐς Ἐρετρίαν , ὧν ἀφικομένων ξὺν ταῖς πρότερον ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ οὔσαις ἓξ καὶ τριάκοντα ἐγένοντο .
So the Athenians were compelled to go to sea in a hurry and with untrained crews, inasmuch as the city was in a state of sedition, and they were anxious with all speed to go to the rescue of what was their most important possession; (for since Attica had been closed against them, Euboea was every thing to them;) and accordingly they sent Thymochares in command of some ships to Eretria.


8.95.3
5967
καὶ εὐθὺς ναυμαχεῖν ἠναγκάζοντο ·
When they arrived there, they amounted, with those that were in Euboea before, to six and thirty; and they were immediately forced to an engagement.


8.95.3
5968
ὁ γὰρ Ἀγησανδρίδας ἀριστοποιησάμενος ἐκ τοῦ Ὠρωποῦ ἀνήγαγε τὰς ναῦς ·
For Agesandridas, after his men had dined, put out from Oropus.


8.95.3
5969
ἀπέχει δὲ μάλιστα ὁ Ὠρωπὸς τῆς τῶν Ἐρετριῶν πόλεως θαλάσσης μέτρον ἑξήκοντα σταδίους .
This is distant from Eretria at most sixty stades by sea.


8.95.4
5970
ὡς οὖν ἐπέπλει , εὐθὺς ἐπλήρουν καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰς ναῦς , οἰόμενοι σφίσι παρὰ ταῖς ναυσὶ τοὺς στρατιώτας εἶναι ·
When, then, he was advancing against them, the Athenians straightway prepared to man their ships, supposing that their men were near their vessels.


8.95.4
5971
οἱ δὲ ἔτυχον οὐκ ἐκ τῆς ἀγορᾶς ἄριστον ἐπισιτιζόμενοι ( οὐδὲν γὰρ ἐπωλεῖτο ἀπὸ προνοίας τῶν Ἐρετριῶν ) , ἀλλ’ ἐκ τῶν ἐπ’ ἔσχατα τοῦ ἄστεως οἰκιῶν , ὅπως σχολῇ πληρουμένων φθάσειαν οἱ πολέμιοι προσπεσόντες καὶ ἐξαναγκάσειαν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οὕτως ὅπως τύχοιεν ἀνάγεσθαι .
They, however, were purchasing provisions for their dinner, not from the market-place, (for by an arrangement of the Eretrians there was nothing on sale there,) but from the houses in the outskirts of the town, in order that the enemy, while the Athenians were long in manning their ships, might attack them by surprise, and compel them to put out just as they might happen.


8.95.4
5972
σημεῖον δὲ αὐτοῖς ἐς τὸν Ὠρωπὸν ἐκ τῆς Ἐρετρίας , ὁπότε χρὴ ἀνάγεσθαι , ἤρθη .
Moreover, a signal had been raised at Eretria to give them notice at Oropus of the time when they should put to sea.


8.95.5
5973
διὰ τοιαύτης δὴ παρασκευῆς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀναγαγόμενοι καὶ ναυμαχήσαντες ὑπὲρ τοῦ λιμένος τῶν Ἐρετριῶν ὀλίγον μέν τινα χρόνον ὅμως καὶ ἀντέσχον , ἔπειτα ἐς φυγὴν τραπόμενοι καταδιώκονται ἐς τὴν γῆν .
The Athenians then, having put out with such scanty preparations, and fought a battle off the harbour of Eretria, held out against them, notwithstanding, for some little time, and were then put to flight and pursued to the shore.


8.95.6
5974
καὶ ὅσοι μὲν αὐτῶν πρὸς τὴν πόλιν τῶν Ἐρετριῶν ὡς φιλίαν καταφεύγουσι , χαλεπώτατα ἔπραξαν φονευόμενοι ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ·
And now such of them as took refuge in the city of the Eretrians, as being friendly to them, fared worst of all, for they were butchered by them;


8.95.6
5975
οἳ δὲ ἐς τὸ τείχισμα τὸ ἐν τῇ Ἐρετρίᾳ , ὃ εἶχον αὐτοί , περιγίγνονται καὶ ὅσαι ἐς Χαλκίδα ἀφικνοῦνται τῶν νεῶν .
but those who fled to the fort in the Eretrian territory, which the Athenians themselves occupied, were saved; as also were all the ships that reached Chalcis.


8.95.7
5976
λαβόντες δὲ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι δύο καὶ εἴκοσι ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ ἄνδρας τοὺς μὲν ἀποκτείναντες , τοὺς δὲ ζωγρήσαντες τροπαῖον ἔστησαν .
The Peloponnesians, having taken two and twenty of the Athenian vessels, and either killed or made prisoners of the men, erected a trophy.


8.95.7
5977
καὶ ὕστερον οὐ πολλῷ Εὔβοιάν τε ἅπασαν ἀποστήσαντες πλὴν Ὠρεοῦ ( ταύτην δὲ αὐτοὶ Ἀθηναῖοι εἶχον ) καὶ τ- ἄλλα τὰ περὶ αὐτὴν καθίσταντο .
And not long after they effected the revolt of the whole of Euboea, excepting Oreus, (which was held by the Athenians themselves,) and arranged all other matters thereabout.


8.96.1
5978
τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις ὡς ἦλθε τὰ περὶ τὴν Εὔβοιαν γεγενημένα , ἔκπληξις μεγίστη δὴ τῶν πρὶν παρέστη .
When the news of what had happened at Euboea reached the Athenians, a greater consternation was felt by them than had ever been before.


8.96.1
5979
οὔτε γὰρ ἡ ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ ξυμφορά , καίπερ μεγάλη τότε δόξασα εἶναι , οὔτε ἄλλο οὐδέν πω οὕτως ἐφόβησεν .
For neither had the disaster in Sicily, though it appeared a great one at the time, nor any other event, ever yet alarmed them so much.


8.96.2
5980
ὅπου γὰρ στρατοπέδου τε τοῦ ἐν Σάμῳ ἀφεστηκότος ἄλλων τε νεῶν οὐκ οὐσῶν οὐδὲ τῶν ἐσβησομένων αὐτῶν τε στασιαζόντων καὶ ἄδηλον ὂν ὁπότε σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ξυρράξουσι , τοσαύτη ἡ ξυμφορὰ ἐπεγεγένητο , ἐν ᾗ ναῦς τε καὶ τὸ μέγιστον Εὔβοιαν ἀπωλωλέκεσαν , ἐξ ἧς πλείω ἢ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ὠφελοῦντο , πῶς οὐκ εἰκότως ἠθύμουν ;
For when, after their army at Samos had revolted from them, and they had no more ships nor men to go on board them, while they were in a state of sedition, and did not know when they might break out into conflict with one another; [when, I say, under such circumstances] so great a calamity had befallen them—one in which they had lost their fleet, and, what was most of all, Euboea, from which they derived more advantages than from Attica—how could their dejection be unnatural?


8.96.3
5981
μάλιστα δ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ δι’ ἐγγυτάτου ἐθορύβει , εἰ οἱ πολέμιοι τολμήσουσι νενικηκότες εὐθὺ σφῶν ἐπὶ τὸν Πειραιᾶ ἐρῆμον ὄντα νεῶν πλεῖν ·
But what especially and most immediately alarmed them, was the thought that the enemy would venture, on the strength of their victory, to sail straightway to the attack of their port Piraeus, while it had no ships for its protection;


8.96.3
5982
καὶ ὅσον οὐκ ἤδη ἐνόμιζον αὐτοὺς παρεῖναι .
and they supposed that they were already all but there.


8.96.4
5983
ὅπερ ἄν , εἰ τολμηρότεροι ἦσαν , ῥᾳδίως ἂν ἐποίησαν , καὶ ἢ διέστησαν ἂν ἔτι μᾶλλον τὴν πόλιν ἐφορμοῦντες ἤ , εἰ ἐπολιόρκουν μένοντες , καὶ τὰς ἀπ’ Ἰωνίας ναῦς ἠνάγκασαν ἂν καίπερ πολεμίας οὔσας τῇ ὀλιγαρχίᾳ τοῖς σφετέροις οἰκείοις καὶ τῇ ξυμπάσῃ πόλει βοηθῆσαι ·
And indeed, if they had been more bold, they might easily have done that, and so have either divided the city still more than ever, by lying near it, or if they had remained and blockaded it, have compelled the fleet in Ionia, though opposed to the oligarchy, to come to the rescue of their own relatives and the whole city;


8.96.4
5984
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ Ἑλλήσποντός τε ἂν ἦν αὐτοῖς καὶ Ἰωνία καὶ αἱ νῆσοι καὶ τὰ μέχρι Εὐβοίας καὶ ὡς εἰπεῖν ἡ Ἀθηναίων ἀρχὴ πᾶσα .
and in the meantime the Hellespont would have been theirs, with Ionia, the islands, everything as far as Euboea, in a word, the whole empire of Athens.


8.96.5
5985
ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐν τούτῳ μόνῳ Λακεδαιμόνιοι Ἀθηναίοις πάντων δὴ ξυμφορώτατοι προσπολεμῆσαι ἐγένοντο , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις πολλοῖς ·
But it was not on this occasion, but on many others also, that the Lacedaemonians proved themselves most convenient people for the Athenians to be at war with.


8.96.5
5986
διάφοροι γὰρ πλεῖστον ὄντες τὸν τρόπον , οἱ μὲν ὀξεῖς , οἱ δὲ βραδεῖς , καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐπιχειρηταί , οἱ δὲ ἄτολμοι , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐν ἀρχῇ ναυτικῇ πλεῖστα ὠφέλουν .
For by being very widely different in character—the one people being quick, and the other slow; the one enterprising, and the other unadventurous—they presented very many advantages, especially in the case of a naval empire.


8.96.5
5987
ἔδειξαν δὲ οἱ Συρακόσιοι ·
A proof of this was given by the Syracusans;


8.96.5
5988
μάλιστα γὰρ ὁμοιότροποι γενόμενοι ἄριστα καὶ προσεπολέμησαν .
for they, through being of a congenial disposition, were also most successful in carrying on war with them.


8.97.1
5989
ἐπὶ δ’ οὖν τοῖς ἠγγελμένοις οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ναῦς τε εἴκοσιν ὅμως ἐπλήρουν καὶ ἐκκλησίαν ξυνέλεγον , μίαν μὲν εὐθὺς τότε πρῶτον ἐς τὴν Πύκνα καλουμένην , οὗπερ καὶ ἄλλοτε εἰώθεσαν , ἐν ᾗπερ καὶ τοὺς τετρακοσίους καταπαύσαντες τοῖς πεντακισχιλίοις ἐψηφίσαντο τὰ πράγματα παραδοῦναι ( εἶναι δὲ αὐτῶν ὁπόσοι καὶ ὅπλα παρέχονται ) καὶ μισθὸν μηδένα φέρειν μηδεμιᾷ ἀρχῇ ·
On receiving therefore this news, the Athenians, notwithstanding, manned twenty ships, and called an assembly; one immediately, which was summoned to meet on that occasion for the first time in what was called the Pnyx, (where they had been accustomed to meet in other days,) and in which they deposed the Four Hundred, and resolved that the government should be put into the hands of the Five Thousand;


8.97.1
5990
εἰ δὲ μή , ἐπάρατον ἐποιήσαντο .
that in that body should be included all who furnished themselves with heavy armour, and that no one should receive pay for the discharge of any office; or if any one did, they declared him to be accursed.


8.97.2
5991
ἐγίγνοντο δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι ὕστερον πυκναὶ ἐκκλησίαι , ἀφ’ ὧν καὶ νομοθέτας καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐψηφίσαντο ἐς τὴν πολιτείαν .
Many other assemblies were also held subsequently, in which they appointed persons to frame a code of laws, and everything else requisite for the government.


8.97.2
5992
καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα δὴ τὸν πρῶτον χρόνον ἐπί γε ἐμοῦ Ἀθηναῖοι φαίνονται εὖ πολιτεύσαντες ·
And during the first period of this constitution the Athenians appear to have enjoyed the best polity they ever did, at least in my time;


8.97.2
5993
μετρία γὰρ ἥ τε ἐς τοὺς ὀλίγους καὶ τοὺς πολλοὺς ξύγκρασις ἐγένετο καὶ ἐκ πονηρῶν τῶν πραγμάτων γενομένων τοῦτο πρῶτον ἀνήνεγκε τὴν πόλιν .
for the blend together of the few and the many was effected with moderation; and this was what raised the state up again after the disastrous occurrences which had taken place.


8.97.3
5994
ἐψηφίσαντο δὲ καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδην καὶ ἄλλους μετ’ αὐτοῦ κατιέναι καὶ παρά τε ἐκεῖνον καὶ παρὰ τὸ ἐν Σάμῳ στρατόπεδον πέμψαντες διεκελεύοντο ἀνθάπτεσθαι τῶν πραγμάτων .
They also passed a decree for the recall of Alcibiades, and some brothers with him; and sending to him and to the army at Samos, they urged them to attend diligently to their interests.


8.98.1
5995
ἐν δὲ τῇ μεταβολῇ ταύτῃ εὐθὺς οἱ μὲν περὶ τὸν Πείσανδρον καὶ Ἀλεξικλέα καὶ ὅσοι ἦσαν τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας μάλιστα ὑπεξέρχονται ἐς τὴν Δεκέλειαν ·
On this change being made, the party of Pisander and Alexicles, and all who were most devoted to the oligarchy, withdrew privily to Decelea;


8.98.1
5996
Ἀρίσταρχος δὲ αὐτῶν μόνος ( ἔτυχε γὰρ καὶ στρατηγῶν ) λαβὼν κατὰ τάχος τοξότας τινὰς τοὺς βαρβαρωτάτους ἐχώρει πρὸς τὴν Οἰνόην .
while Aristarchus alone of them, happening to be in office as general, took with all haste some of the most barbarous amongst the archers, and proceeded to Oenoe.


8.98.2
5997
ἦν δὲ Ἀθηναίων ἐν μεθορίοις τῆς Βοιωτίας τεῖχος , ἐπολιόρκουν δ’ αὐτὸ διὰ ξυμφορὰν σφίσιν ἐκ τῆς Οἰνόης γενομένην ἀνδρῶν ἐκ Δεκελείας ἀναχωρούντων διαφθορᾶς οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἐθελοντηδόν , προσπαρακαλέσαντες τοὺς Βοιωτούς .
This was a fortress belonging to the Athenians on the borders of Boeotia, and in consequence of a blow that had been inflicted on them by the garrison, by cutting off a party of men on their return from Decelea, it was being besieged by the Corinthians, who had volunteered for the service, and had called the Boeotians also to their aid.


8.98.3
5998
κοινολογησάμενος οὖν αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος ἀπατᾷ τοὺς ἐν τῇ Οἰνόῃ , λέγων ὡς καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει τ- ἄλλα ξυμβεβήκασι Λακεδαιμονίοις , κ- ἐκείνους δεῖ Βοιωτοῖς τὸ χωρίον παραδοῦναι ·
After communicating therefore with these, Aristarchus deceived those in Oenoe, by telling them that their countrymen in the city had made a general surrender to the Lacedaemonians, and they must give up the place to the Boeotians;


8.98.3
5999
ἐπὶ τούτοις γὰρ ξυμβεβάσθαι .
for that such were the terms of the capitulation.


8.98.3
6000
οἱ δὲ πιστεύσαντες ὡς ἀνδρὶ στρατηγῷ καὶ οὐκ εἰδότες οὐδὲν διὰ τὸ πολιορκεῖσθαι ὑπόσπονδοι ἐξέρχονται .
They therefore, believing him, inasmuch as he was one of the generals, and knowing nothing that had happened, in consequence of their being blockaded, evacuated the fort under truce.


8.98.4
6001
τούτῳ μὲν τῷ τρόπῳ Οἰνόην τε ληφθεῖσαν Βοιωτοὶ κατέλαβον καὶ ἡ ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις ὀλιγαρχία καὶ στάσις ἐπαύσατο .
It was in this manner that the Boeotians took and occupied Oenoe, and that the oligarchy and sedition at Athens came to an end.


8.99.1
6002
ὑπὸ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τοῦ θέρους τούτου καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ Πελοποννήσιοι , ὡς τροφήν τε οὐδεὶς ἐδίδου τῶν ὑπὸ Τισσαφέρνους τότε ὅτε ἐπὶ τὴν Ἄσπενδον παρῄει προσταχθέντων , καὶ αἱ Φοίνισσαι νῆες οὐδὲ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης τέως που ἧκον , ὅ τε Φίλιππος ὁ ξυμπεμφθεὶς αὐτῷ ἐπεστάλκει Μινδάρῳ τῷ ναυάρχῳ καὶ ἄλλος Ἱπποκράτης , ἀνὴρ Σπαρτιάτης καὶ ὢν ἐν Φασήλιδι , ὅτι οὔτε αἱ νῆες παρέσοιντο πάντα τε ἀδικοῖντο ὑπὸ Τισσαφέρνους , Φαρνάβαζός τε ἐπεκαλεῖτο αὐτοὺς καὶ ἦν πρόθυμος κομίσας τὰς ναῦς καὶ αὐτὸς τὰς λοιπὰς ἔτι πόλεις τῆς ἑαυτοῦ ἀρχῆς ἀποστῆσαι τῶν Ἀθηναίων , ὥσπερ καὶ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης , ἐλπίζων πλέον τι σχήσειν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ , οὕτω δὴ ὁ Μίνδαρος πολλῷ κόσμῳ καὶ ἀπὸ παραγγέλματος αἰφνιδίου , ὅπως λάθοι τοὺς ἐν Σάμῳ , ἄρας ἀπὸ τῆς Μιλήτου ναυσὶ τρισὶ καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα ἔπλει ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ( πρότερον δὲ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ θέρει τῷδε ἑκκαίδεκα ἐς αὐτὸν νῆες ἐσέπλευσαν , αἳ καὶ τῆς Χερσονήσου τι μέρος κατέδραμον ) ·
About the same period of this summer the Peloponnesians at Miletus also executed the following measures. When none of those who were entrusted with the business by Tissaphernes, at the time that he went to Aspendus, afforded them supplies, and neither the Phoenician ships nor Tissaphernes made their appearance hitherto, but Philippus who had been sent with him, as well as another Spartan named Hippocrates, who was at Phaselis, wrote word to Mindarus the admiral, that the ships would not join them, and that they were being wronged by Tissaphernes in every respect; and when again Pharnabazus was calling them to his aid, and was desirous to get the ships in his turn, like Tissaphernes, and cause the remaining cities in his government to revolt from the Athenians, hoping to gain some advantage thereby; under these circumstances, I say, Mindarus, with great regularity, and with orders suddenly given, to escape the observation of those at Samos, weighed anchor from Miletus with three and seventy ships, and sailed for the Hellespont. Sixteen ships had at an earlier period of this same summer entered that sea, and overrun some parts of the Chersonese.


8.99.1
6003
χειμασθεὶς δὲ ἀνέμῳ καὶ ἀναγκασθεὶς καταίρει ἐς τὴν Ἴκαρον , καὶ μείνας ἐν αὐτῇ ὑπὸ ἀπλοίας πέντε ἢ ἓξ ἡμέρας ἀφικνεῖται ἐς τὴν Χίον .
But being caught in a storm, and compelled to do so, he put in at Icarus, and after remaining there through stress of weather five or six days, arrived subsequently at Chios.


8.100.1
6004
ὁ δὲ Θράσυλος ἐκ τῆς Σάμου , ἐπειδὴ ἐπύθετο αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου ἀπηρκότα , ἔπλει καὶ αὐτὸς ναυσὶν εὐθὺς πέντε καὶ πεντήκοντα , ἐπειγόμενος μὴ φθάσῃ ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ἐσπλεύσας .
When Thrasylus heard of his having put out from Miletus, he himself also set sail straightway from Samos with five and fifty ships, hurrying on to prevent his sailing into the Hellespont before him.


8.100.2
6005
αἰσθόμενος δὲ ὅτι ἐν τῇ Χίῳ εἴη καὶ νομίσας αὐτὸν καθέξειν αὐτοῦ , σκοποὺς μὲν κατεστήσατο καὶ ἐν τῇ Λέσβῳ καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀντιπέρας ἠπείρῳ , εἰ ἄρα ποι κινοῖντο αἱ νῆες , ὅπως μὴ λάθοιεν , αὐτὸς δὲ ἐς τὴν Μήθυμναν παραπλεύσας ἄλφιτά τε καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἐπιτήδεια παρασκευάζειν ἐκέλευεν ὡς , ἢν πλείων χρόνος γίγνηται , ἐκ τῆς Λέσβου τοὺς ἐπίπλους τῇ Χίῳ ποιησόμενος .
But on finding that he was at Chios, and expecting that he would stay there, he posted scouts both in Lesbos and on the mainland opposite, that in case of the ships stirring in any direction they might not do so unobserved; while he himself coasted along to Methymna, and gave orders for preparing meal and other necessaries, with a view of advancing from Lesbos to attack them at Chios, if any length of time should be spent there. At the same time, since Eresus in Lesbos had revolted, he wished to sail against and take it, if he could.


8.100.3
6006
ἅμα δὲ ( Ἔρεσος γὰρ τῆς Λέσβου ἀφειστήκει ) ἐβούλετο ἐπ’ αὐτὴν πλεύσας , εἰ δύναιτο , ἐξελεῖν .
For some exiles of the Methymnaeans, and those the most influential, having carried over from Cuma about fifty heavy-armed men who had been associated with them, and hired others from the continent, with three hundred in all, of whom Alexander, a Theban, took the command on the strength of his connexion with them, made an attack on Methymna first;

6007
Μηθυμναίων γὰρ οὐχ οἱ ἀδυνατώτατοι φυγάδες διακομίσαντες ἔκ τε τῆς Κύμης προσεταιριστοὺς ὁπλίτας ὡς πεντήκοντα καὶ τῶν ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου μισθωσάμενοι , ξύμπασιν ὡς τριακοσίοις , Ἀναξάνδρου Θηβαίου κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς ἡγουμένου , προσέβαλον πρῶτον Μηθύμνῃ , καὶ ἀποκρουσθέντες τῆς πείρας διὰ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Μυτιλήνης Ἀθηναίων φρουροὺς προελθόντας αὖθις ἔξω μάχῃ ἀπωσθέντες καὶ διὰ τοῦ ὄρους κομισθέντες ἀφιστᾶσι τὴν Ἔρεσον .
and when beaten off from the attempt by means of the Athenian garrison troops which had advanced from Mytilene, and again repulsed in an engagement outside of the town, made their way over the mountain, and procured the revolt of Eresus.


8.100.4
6008
πλεύσας οὖν ὁ Θράσυλος ἐπ’ αὐτὴν πάσαις ταῖς ναυσὶ διενοεῖτο προσβολὴν ποιεῖσθαι ·
Thrasylus therefore sailed against it with all his ships, intending to assault it.


8.100.4
6009
προαφιγμένος δὲ αὐτόσε ἦν καὶ ὁ Θρασύβουλος πέντε ναυσὶν ἐκ τῆς Σάμου , ὡς ἠγγέλθη αὐτοῖς ἡ τῶν φυγάδων αὕτη διάβασις ·
Thrasybulus, too, had arrived there before him with five ships from Samos, on receiving tidings of the exiles thus crossing over;


8.100.4
6010
ὑστερήσας δ’ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἔρεσον ἐφώρμει ἐλθών .
but being too late, he went to Eresus, and lay at anchor before it.


8.100.5
6011
προσεγένοντο δὲ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου τινὲς δύο νῆες ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀνακομιζόμεναι καὶ Μηθυμναῖαι πέντε ·
They were also joined by two vessels on their return home from the Hellespont, and by those of the Methymnaeans;


8.100.5
6012
καὶ αἱ πᾶσαι νῆες παρῆσαν ἑπτὰ καὶ ἑξήκοντα , ἀφ’ ὧν τῷ στρατεύματι παρεσκευάζοντο ὡς κατὰ κράτος μηχαναῖς τε καὶ παντὶ τρόπῳ , ἢν δύνωνται , αἱρήσοντες τὴν Ἔρεσον .
and so there were present, in all, seven and sixty ships, with the troops of which they made their preparations for taking Eresus by storm, if they could, with the aid of engines, or in any way whatever.


8.101.1
6013
ὁ δὲ Μίνδαρος ἐν τούτῳ καὶ ἐκ τῆς Χίου τῶν Πελοποννησίων αἱ νῆες ἐπισιτισάμεναι δυοῖν ἡμέραιν καὶ λαβόντες παρὰ τῶν Χίων τρεῖς τεσσαρακοστὰς ἕκαστος Χίας τῇ τρίτῃ διὰ ταχέων ἀπαίρουσιν ἐκ τῆς Χίου οὐ πελάγιαι , ἵνα μὴ περιτύχωσι ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ἐρέσῳ ναυσίν , ἀλλὰ ἐν ἀριστερᾷ τὴν Λέσβον ἔχοντες ἔπλεον ἐπὶ τὴν ἤπειρον .
In the mean time Mindarus and the Peloponnesian ships at Chios, after being victualled for two days, and receiving from the Chians three Chian tessaracostes a man, on the third day put out with all speed from the island, not into the open sea, to avoid falling in with the fleet at Eresus, but sailing to the continent with Lesbos on their left hand.


8.101.2
6014
καὶ προσβαλόντες τῆς Φωκαΐδος ἐς τὸν ἐν Καρτερίοις λιμένα καὶ ἀριστοποιησάμενοι , παραπλεύσαντες τὴν Κυμαίαν δειπνοποιοῦνται ἐν Ἀργινούσαις τῆς ἠπείρου , ἐν τῷ ἀντιπέρας τῆς Μυτιλήνης .
After touching at the port of Carteria, in the Phocaean territory, and dining, they proceeded along the coast of Cuma, and supped at Argennusa on the mainland, over against Mytilene.


8.101.3
6015
ἐντεῦθεν δὲ ἔτι πολλῆς νυκτὸς παραπλεύσαντες καὶ ἀφικόμενοι τῆς ἠπείρου ἐς Ἁρματοῦντα καταντικρὺ Μηθύμνης , ἀριστοποιησάμενοι διὰ ταχέων παραπλεύσαντες Λεκτὸν καὶ Λάρισαν καὶ Ἁμαξιτὸν καὶ τὰ ταύτῃ χωρία ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς Ῥοίτειον ἤδη τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου πρωίτερον μέσων νυκτῶν .
Thence they still coasted on, though it was late in the night, and arrived at Harmatus on the continent, just opposite Methymna, and after dinner passing quickly by Lectum, Larisa, Hamaxitus, and the towns in those parts,


8.101.3
6016
εἰσὶ δ’ αἳ τῶν νεῶν καὶ ἐς Σίγειον κατῆραν καὶ ἄλλοσε τῶν ταύτῃ χωρίων .
came somewhat before midnight to Rhoeteum, and so were now in the Hellespont. Some of the ships also put in at Sigeum, and other places in that neighbourhood.


8.102.1
6017
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν τῇ Σηστῷ δυοῖν δεούσαις εἴκοσι ναυσὶν ὄντες , ὡς αὐτοῖς οἵ τε φρυκτωροὶ ἐσήμαινον καὶ ᾐσθάνοντο τὰ πυρὰ ἐξαίφνης πολλὰ ἐν τῇ πολεμίᾳ φανέντα , ἔγνωσαν ὅτι ἐσπλέουσιν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι .
Now the Athenians were at Sestos with eighteen ships; and when their friends gave them notice by fire signals, while they also observed the fires on the hostile shore suddenly appear numerous, they were aware that the Peloponnesians were entering the Hellespont.


8.102.1
6018
καὶ τῆς αὐτῆς ταύτης νυκτὸς ὡς εἶχον τάχους ὑπομείξαντες τῇ Χερσονήσῳ παρέπλεον ἐπ’ Ἐλαιοῦντος , βουλόμενοι ἐκπλεῦσαι ἐς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν τὰς τῶν πολεμίων ναῦς .
Accordingly that same night, sailing as quickly as they could, and keeping close under the shore of the Chersonese, they coasted along towards Elaeus, wishing to escape from the enemy's fleet into the open sea.


8.102.2
6019
καὶ τὰς μὲν ἐν Ἀβύδῳ ἑκκαίδεκα ναῦς ἔλαθον , προειρημένης φυλακῆς τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ , ὅπως αὐτῶν ἀνακῶς ἕξουσιν , ἢν ἐκπλέωσιν ·
And they eluded the observation of the sixteen ships at Abydus, although orders for keeping guard had been before given by their friends who went to them, that they might be on the alert against the Athenians in case they should sail out.


8.102.2
6020
τὰς δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Μινδάρου ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ κατιδόντες , τὴν δίωξιν εὐθὺς ποιουμένων οὐ φθάνουσι πάσαις , ἀλλ’ αἱ μὲν πλείους ἐπὶ τῆς Ἴμβρου καὶ Λήμνου διέφυγον , τέσσαρες δὲ τῶν νεῶν αἱ ὕσταται πλέουσαι καταλαμβάνονται παρὰ τὸν Ἐλαιοῦντα .
But descrying those with Mindarus in the morning, and being immediately chased by them, they had not all time to escape, but the greater part of them did, to Imbros and Lemnus; while four of the ships, which were sailing last, were overtaken off Elaeus.


8.102.3
6021
καὶ μίαν μὲν ἐποκείλασαν κατὰ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Πρωτεσιλάου αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσι λαμβάνουσι , δύο δὲ ἑτέρας ἄνευ τῶν ἀνδρῶν ·
One of these, which was stranded opposite the temple of Protesilaus, they took together with its crew, and two others without their crews;


8.102.3
6022
τὴν δὲ μίαν πρὸς τῇ Ἴμβρῳ κενὴν κατακαίουσιν .
while the remaining one they burnt, after it had been deserted, close to Imbros.


8.103.1
6023
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ταῖς τε ἐξ Ἀβύδου ξυμμιγείσαις καὶ ταῖς ἄλλαις ξυμπάσαις ἓξ καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα πολιορκήσαντες Ἐλαιοῦντα ταύτην τὴν ἡμέραν , ὡς οὐ προσεχώρει , ἀπέπλευσαν ἐς Ἄβυδον .
After this, with the vessels which had joined them from Abydus and the rest, amounting in all to eighty-six, they besieged Elaeus that day, and when it did not surrender, sailed back to Abydus.


8.103.2
6024
οἱ δ’ Ἀθηναῖοι ψευσθέντες τῶν σκοπῶν καὶ οὐκ ἂν οἰόμενοι σφᾶς λαθεῖν τὸν παράπλουν τῶν πολεμίων νεῶν , ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν τειχομαχοῦντες , ὡς ᾔσθοντο , εὐθὺς ἀπολιπόντες τὴν Ἔρεσον κατὰ τάχος ἐβοήθουν ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ·
As for the Athenians, they had been deceived by their scouts, and did not imagine that the passage of the enemy's fleet could ever escape their vigilance, but were leisurely assaulting the walls of Eresus. When, how ever, they were aware of it, they immediately left Eresus, and proceeded with all haste to the defence of the Hellespont.


8.103.3
6025
καὶ δύο τε ναῦς τῶν Πελοποννησίων αἱροῦσιν , αἳ πρὸς τὸ πέλαγος τότε θρασύτερον ἐν τῇ διώξει ἀπάρασαι περιέπεσον αὐτοῖς , καὶ ἡμέρᾳ ὕστερον ἀφικόμενοι ὁρμίζονται ἐς τὸν Ἐλαιοῦντα καὶ τὰς ἐκ τῆς Ἴμβρου ὅσαι κατέφυγον κομίζονται καὶ ἐς τὴν ναυμαχίαν πέντε ἡμέρας παρεσκευάζοντο .
And they took two of the Peloponnesian ships, which having on that occasion put out into the open sea more boldly than the rest, fell in with them. The next day they arrived and cast anchor at Elaeus, and bringing in from Imbros such ships as had taken refuge there, they were five days making preparations for the battle.


8.104.1
6026
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἐναυμάχουν τρόπῳ τοιῷδε .
After this they fought in the following manner.


8.104.1
6027
οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι παρέπλεον ἐπὶ κέρως ταξάμενοι παρ’ αὐτὴν τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ τῆς Σηστοῦ , οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι αἰσθόμενοι ἐκ τῆς Ἀβύδου ἀντανῆγον καὶ αὐτοί .
The Athenians, drawn up in column, were sailing close along shore towards Sestos; while the Peloponnesians, observing this from Abydus, put out on their side also to meet them.


8.104.2
6028
καὶ ὡς ἔγνωσαν ναυμαχήσοντες , παρέτειναν τὸ κέρας οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι παρὰ τὴν Χερσόνησον , ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ Ἰδάκου μέχρι Ἀρριανῶν , νῆες ἓξ καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα , οἱ δ’ αὖ Πελοποννήσιοι ἀπὸ Ἀβύδου μέχρι Δαρδάνου , νῆες ἓξ καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα .
When they found that they were on the eve of an engagement, they extended their flank, the Athenians along the Chersonese, from Idacus to Arrhiana, with seventy-six ships; the Peloponnesians, on the other hand, from Abydus to Dardanus, with eighty-six.


8.104.3
6029
κέρας δὲ τοῖς μὲν Πελοποννησίοις εἶχον τὸ μὲν δεξιὸν Συρακόσιοι , τὸ δ’ ἕτερον αὐτὸς Μίνδαρος καὶ τῶν νεῶν αἱ ἄριστα πλέουσαι , Ἀθηναίοις δὲ τὸ μὲν ἀριστερὸν Θράσυλος , ὁ δὲ Θρασύβουλος τὸ δεξιόν ·
On the side of the Peloponnesians, the right wing was held by the Syracusans, the other by Mindarus himself and the fastest sailing vessels;


8.104.3
6030
οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι στρατηγοὶ ὡς ἕκαστοι διετάξαντο .
on that of the Athenians, the left was held by Thrasylus, the right by Thrasybulus; while the other commanders took their position as might severally happen.


8.104.4
6031
ἐπειγομένων δὲ τῶν Πελοποννησίων πρότερόν τε ξυμμεῖξαι , καὶ κατὰ μὲν τὸ δεξιὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὑπερσχόντες αὐτοὶ τῷ εὐωνύμῳ ἀποκλῇσαι τοῦ ἔξω αὐτοὺς ἔκπλου , εἰ δύναιντο , κατὰ δὲ τὸ μέσον ἐξῶσαι πρὸς τὴν γῆν οὐχ ἑκὰς οὖσαν , οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι γνόντες , ᾗ μὲν ἐβούλοντο ἀποφάρξασθαι αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐναντίοι , ἀντεπεξῆγον καὶ περιεγίγνοντο τῷ πλῷ , τὸ δ’ εὐώνυμον αὐτοῖς ὑπερεβεβλήκει ἤδη τὴν ἄκραν ἣ Κυνὸς σῆμα καλεῖται .
It being the object of the Peloponnesians to strike the first blow, and by outflanking the Athenians' right with their own left to exclude them, if they could, from sailing out of the straits, as well as to drive their centre on to the shore, which was at no great distance; the Athenians, aware of this, extended their own wing also where the enemy wished to hem them in, and had the advantage over them in sailing;


8.104.5
6032
τῷ δὲ μέσῳ , τοιούτου ξυμβαίνοντος , ἀσθενέσι καὶ διεσπασμέναις ταῖς ναυσὶ καθίσταντο , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐλάσσοσι χρώμενοι τὸ πλῆθος καὶ τοῦ χωρίου τοῦ περὶ τὸ Κυνὸς σῆμα ὀξεῖαν καὶ γωνιώδη τὴν περιβολὴν ἔχοντος , ὥστε τὰ ἐν τῷ ἐπέκεινα αὐτοῦ γιγνόμενα μὴ κάτοπτα εἶναι .
while their left had by this time passed the headland called Cynossema. But in consequence of this, they had to form their centre with weak and scattered ships, especially as they had the smaller number at their command, and the coast about Cynossema formed a sharp and angular projection, so that what was doing on the other side of it was not visible.


8.105.1
6033
προσπεσόντες οὖν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι κατὰ τὸ μέσον ἐξέωσάν τε ἐς τὸ ξηρὸν τὰς ναῦς τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ ἐς τὴν γῆν ἐπεξέβησαν , τῷ ἔργῳ πολὺ περισχόντες .
The Peloponnesians therefore, falling on their centre, drove the Athenian ships ashore, and landed to follow up their attack, having had a decided advantage in the action.


8.105.2
6034
ἀμῦναι δὲ τῷ μέσῳ οὔθ’ οἱ περὶ τὸν Θρασύβουλον ἀπὸ τοῦ δεξιοῦ ὑπὸ πλήθους τῶν ἐπικειμένων νεῶν ἐδύναντο οὔθ’ οἱ περὶ τὸν Θράσυλον ἀπὸ τοῦ εὐωνύμου ( ἀφανές τε γὰρ ἦν διὰ τὴν ἄκραν τὸ Κυνὸς σῆμα , καὶ ἅμα οἱ Συρακόσιοι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι οὐκ ἐλάσσους ἐπιτεταγμένοι εἶργον αὐτούς ) , πρὶν οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι διὰ τὸ κρατήσαντες ἀδεῶς ἄλλοι ἄλλην ναῦν διώκειν ἤρξαντο μέρει τινὶ σφῶν ἀτακτότεροι γενέσθαι .
To assist their centre was neither in the power of Thrasybulu on the right, owing to the superior number of ships that were pressing on him, nor of Thrasylus on the left; for it was con cealed from him by the headland of Cynossema, and, moreover. the Syracusans and the rest who were opposed to him with no inferior numbers prevented his doing it: until the Peloponnesians, from pursuing, in the security of victory, different vessels in different directions, began to fall into greater disorder in one part of their force.


8.105.3
6035
γνόντες δὲ οἱ περὶ τὸν Θρασύβουλον τὰς ἐπὶ σφίσι ναῦς ἐπεχούσας παυσάμενοι τῆς ἐπεξαγωγῆς ἤδη τοῦ κέρως καὶ ἐπαναστρέψαντες εὐθὺς ἠμύναντό τε καὶ τρέπουσι , καὶ τὰς κατὰ τὸ νικῆσαν τῶν Πελοποννησίων μέρος ὑπολαβόντες πεπλανημένας ἔκοπτόν τε καὶ ἐς φόβον τὰς πλείους ἀμαχεὶ καθίστασαν .
Thrasybulus therefore, observing this, ceased now from extending the flank, and facing about immediately attacked and routed the ships opposed to him; and then proceeding to those on the victorious part of the enemy's line, handled them roughly in their scattered condition, and threw most of them into a panic without striking a blow.


8.105.3
6036
οἵ τε Συρακόσιοι ἐτύγχανον καὶ αὐτοὶ ἤδη τοῖς περὶ τὸν Θράσυλον ἐνδεδωκότες καὶ μᾶλλον ἐς φυγὴν ὁρμήσαντες , ἐπειδὴ καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἑώρων .
The Syracusans also had by this time yielded the victory to Thrasylus, and taken to flight more decidedly, when they saw the rest doing so likewise.


8.106.1
6037
γεγενημένης δὲ τῆς τροπῆς καὶ καταφυγόντων τῶν Πελοποννησίων πρὸς τὸν Μείδιον μάλιστα ποταμὸν τὸ πρῶτον , ὕστερον δὲ ἐς Ἄβυδον , ναῦς μὲν ὀλίγας ἔλαβον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ( στενὸς γὰρ ὢν ὁ Ἑλλήσποντος βραχείας τὰς ἀποφυγὰς τοῖς ἐναντίοις παρεῖχε ) , τὴν μέντοι νίκην ταύτην τῆς ναυμαχίας ἐπικαιροτάτην δὴ ἔσχον .
The rout having thus been effected, and the Peloponnesians having most of them taken refuge at the mouth of the river Midius in the first instance, and then at Abydus, though the Athenians took but few ships, (for the narrow breadth of the Hellespont gave their opponents places of refuge at a little distance,) yet the victory which they gained in this sea-fight was most opportune for them.


8.106.2
6038
φοβούμενοι γὰρ τέως τὸ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ναυτικὸν διά τε τὰ κατὰ βραχὺ σφάλματα καὶ διὰ τὴν ἐν τῇ Σικελίᾳ ξυμφοράν , ἀπηλλάγησαν τοῦ σφᾶς τε αὐτοὺς καταμέμφεσθαι καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους ἔτι ἀξίους του ἐς τὰ ναυτικὰ νομίζειν .
For whereas they had before been afraid of the Peloponnesian fleet, in consequence of losses in detail, as well as of the disaster in Sicily, they now ceased to think disparagingly of themselves, and to consider their enemies as good for any thing at sea.


8.106.3
6039
ναῦς μέντοι τῶν ἐναντίων λαμβάνουσι Χίας μὲν ὀκτώ , Κορινθίας δὲ πέντε , Ἀμπρακιώτιδας δὲ δύο καὶ Βοιωτίας δύο , Λευκαδίων δὲ καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Συρακοσίων καὶ Πελληνέων μίαν ἑκάστων ·
However, they took from their opponents eight Chian vessels, five Corinthian, two Ambracian, two Boeotian, and one Leucadian, Lacedaemonian, Syracusan, and Pellenian, respectively;


8.106.3
6040
αὐτοὶ δὲ πέντε καὶ δέκα ναῦς ἀπολλύασιν .
while they themselves lost fifteen.


8.106.4
6041
στήσαντες δὲ τροπαῖον ἐπὶ τῇ ἄκρᾳ οὗ τὸ Κυνὸς σῆμα καὶ τὰ ναυάγια προσαγαγόμενοι καὶ νεκροὺς τοῖς ἐναντίοις ὑποσπόνδους ἀποδόντες ἀπέστειλαν καὶ ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας τριήρη ἄγγελον τῆς νίκης .
After erecting a trophy on the headland of Cynossema, securing the wrecks, and restoring the enemy their slain under a truce, they then despatched a trireme to Athens with the news of their victory.


8.106.5
6042
οἱ δὲ ἀφικομένης τῆς νεὼς καὶ ἀνέλπιστον τὴν εὐτυχίαν ἀκούσαντες ἐπί τε ταῖς περὶ τὴν Εὔβοιαν ἄρτι ξυμφοραῖς καὶ κατὰ τὴν στάσιν γεγενημέναις πολὺ ἐπερρώσθησαν καὶ ἐνόμισαν σφίσιν ἔτι δυνατὰ εἶναι τὰ πράγματα , ἢν προθύμως ἀντιλαμβάνωνται , περιγενέσθαι .
On the arrival of the vessel, and on hearing of their unexpected good fortune, after the disasters which had recently befallen them in Euboea, and through their own sedition, they were much encouraged, and thought that their cause might still possibly prevail, if they supported it with vigour.


8.107.1
6043
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ναυμαχίαν ἡμέρᾳ τετάρτῃ ὑπὸ σπουδῆς ἐπισκευάσαντες τὰς ναῦς οἱ ἐν τῇ Σηστῷ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔπλεον ἐπὶ Κύζικον ἀφεστηκυῖαν ·
On the fourth day after the engagement, the Athenians at Sestos having hastily refitted their ships, sailed against Cyzicus, which had revolted.


8.107.1
6044
καὶ κατιδόντες κατὰ Ἁρπάγιον καὶ Πρίαπον τὰς ἀπὸ τοῦ Βυζαντίου ὀκτὼ ναῦς ὁρμούσας , ἐπιπλεύσαντες καὶ μάχῃ κρατήσαντες τοὺς ἐν τῇ γῇ ἔλαβον τὰς ναῦς .
And descrying the eight ships from Byzantium lying at anchor off Harpagium and Priapus, they attacked them, and took the vessels, after defeating in a battle those who came to help them on shore.


8.107.1
6045
ἀφικόμενοι δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν Κύζικον ἀτείχιστον οὖσαν προσηγάγοντο πάλιν καὶ χρήματα ἀνέπραξαν .
On their arrival also at Cyzicus, which was unfortified, they got possession of it again, and levied a contribution from it.


8.107.2
6046
ἔπλευσαν δὲ ἐν τούτῳ καὶ οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἐκ τῆς Ἀβύδου ἐπὶ τὸν Ἐλαιοῦντα καὶ τῶν σφετέρων νεῶν τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ὅσαι ἦσαν ὑγιεῖς ἐκομίσαντο ( τὰς δὲ ἄλλας Ἐλαιούσιοι κατέκαυσαν ) , καὶ ἐς τὴν Εὔβοιαν ἀπέπεμψαν Ἱπποκράτη καὶ Ἐπικλέα κομιοῦντας τὰς ἐκεῖθεν ναῦς .
In the mean time the Peloponnesians also sailed front Abydus to Elaeus, and recovered such of their ships as were in sound condition, (the rest having been burnt by the inhabitants,) and then sent Hippocrates and Epicles to Euboea, to fetch the squadron that was there.


8.108.1
6047
κατέπλευσε δὲ ὑπὸ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τούτους καὶ ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης ταῖς τρισὶ καὶ δέκα ναυσὶν ἀπὸ τῆς Καύνου καὶ Φασήλιδος ἐς τὴν Σάμον , ἀγγέλλων ὅτι τάς τε Φοινίσσας ναῦς ἀποστρέψειε Πελοποννησίοις ὥστε μὴ ἐλθεῖν καὶ τὸν Τισσαφέρνην ὅτι φίλον πεποιήκοι μᾶλλον Ἀθηναίοις ἢ πρότερον .
About this same time, too, Alcibiades returned to Samos with his thirteen ships from Caunus and Phaselis, bringing word that he had prevented the Phoenician ships from joining the Peloponnesians, and had made Tissaphernes a more decided friend to the Athenians than before. Having then manned nine ships in addition to those he had already, he levied large sums of money from the Halicarnassians, and fortified Cos.


8.108.2
6048
καὶ πληρώσας ναῦς ἐννέα πρὸς αἷς εἶχεν Ἁλικαρνασσέας τε πολλὰ χρήματα ἐξέπραξε καὶ Κῶν ἐτείχισεν .
After executing these measures, and placing a governor in Cos, it being now towards autumn, he sailed back to Samos.


8.108.2
6049
ταῦτα δὲ πράξας καὶ ἄρχοντα ἐν τῇ Κῷ καταστήσας πρὸς τὸ μετόπωρον ἤδη ἐς τὴν Σάμον κατέπλευσεν .
As for Tissaphernes, when he heard that the Peloponnesian squadron had sailed from Miletus to the Hellespont, he set out again from Aspendus, and proceeded to Ionia.


8.108.3
6050
καὶ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀσπένδου , ὡς ἐπύθετο τὰς τῶν Πελοποννησίων ναῦς ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον πεπλευκυίας , ἀναζεύξας ἤλαυνεν ἐπὶ τῆς Ἰωνίας .
Now while the Peloponnesians were in the Hellespont, the Antandrians, (of Aeolian extraction,) conveyed by land over Mount Ida some heavy-armed troops from Abydus, and introduced them into their city, in consequence of being ill-treated by Arsaces the Persian, Tissaphernes' lieutenant.


8.108.4
6051
ὄντων δὲ τῶν Πελοποννησίων ἐν τῷ Ἑλλησπόντῳ , Ἀντάνδριοι ( εἰσὶ δὲ Αἰολῆς ) παρακομισάμενοι ἐκ τῆς Ἀβύδου πεζῇ διὰ τῆς Ἴδης τοῦ ὄρους ὁπλίτας ἐσηγάγοντο ἐς τὴν πόλιν , ὑπὸ Ἀρσάκου τοῦ Πέρσου Τισσαφέρνους ὑπάρχου ἀδικούμενοι , ὅσπερ καὶ Δηλίους τοὺς Ἀτραμύττιον κατοικήσαντας ὅτε ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων Δήλου καθάρσεως ἕνεκα ἀνέστησαν , ἔχθραν προσποιησάμενος ἄδηλον καὶ ἐπαγγείλας στρατιὰν αὐτῶν τοῖς βελτίστοις , ἐξαγαγὼν ὡς ἐπὶ φιλίᾳ καὶ ξυμμαχίᾳ , τηρήσας ἀριστοποιουμένους καὶ περιστήσας τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ κατηκόντισεν .
This same man, pretending to have a quarrel which he had not yet avowed, and offering service to the chief men amongst them, had induced the Delians, who had settled at Atramyttium, when driven from their homes by the Athenians for the purpose of purifying Delos, to go out as though on terms of friendship and alliance with him; and then, having watched when they were at dinner, had surrounded them with his own troops, and shot them down.


8.108.5
6052
φοβούμενοι οὖν αὐτὸν διὰ τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον μήποτε καὶ περὶ σφᾶς τι παρανομήσῃ , καὶ ἄλλα ἐπιβάλλοντος αὐτοῦ ἃ φέρειν οὐκ ἐδύναντο , ἐκβάλλουσι τοὺς φρουροὺς αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως .
Since therefore they were afraid, on account of this deed, that he might some time or other commit some outrage on themselves too, and since he also imposed upon them burdens which they could not bear, they expelled his garrison from their citadel.


8.109.1
6053
ὁ δὲ Τισσαφέρνης αἰσθόμενος καὶ τοῦτο τῶν Πελοποννησίων τὸ ἔργον καὶ οὐ μόνον τὸ ἐν τῇ Μιλήτῳ καὶ Κνίδῳ ( καὶ ἐνταῦθα γὰρ αὐτοῦ ἐξεπεπτώκεσαν οἱ φρουροί ) , διαβεβλῆσθαί τε νομίσας αὐτοῖς σφόδρα καὶ δείσας μὴ καὶ ἄλλο τι ἔτι βλάπτωσι , καὶ ἅμα ἀχθόμενος εἰ Φαρνάβαζος ἐξ ἐλάσσονος χρόνου καὶ δαπάνης δεξάμενος αὐτοὺς κατορθώσει τι μᾶλλον τῶν πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους , πορεύεσθαι διενοεῖτο πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου , ὅπως μέμψηταί τε τῶν περὶ τὴν Ἄντανδρον γεγενημένων καὶ τὰς διαβολὰς καὶ περὶ τῶν Φοινισσῶν νεῶν καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὡς εὐπρεπέστατα ἀπολογήσηται .
When Tissaphernes heard of this act also on the part of the Peloponnesians, as well as that at Miletus and that at Cnidus, (for there too his garrisons had been driven out,) considering that he must have incurred their violent displeasure, and fearing that they might do him still further mischief, and, moreover, being vexed to think that Pharnabazus, by receiving them, might in less time and at less expense be more successful in his measures against the Athenians, he determined to go to them at the Hellespont, that he might both complain of what had been done at Antandrus, and defend himself as plausibly as he could against their charges respecting the Phoenician fleet, and all other matters.


8.109.1
6054
καὶ ἀφικόμενος πρῶτον ἐς Ἔφεσον θυσίαν ἐποιήσατο τῇ Ἀρτέμιδι .
Accordingly he went first to Ephesus, and offered sacrifice to Diana.


8.109.2
6055
ὅταν ὁ μετὰ τοῦτο τὸ θέρος χειμὼν τελευτήσῃ , ἓν καὶ εἰκοστὸν ἔτος πληροῦται .
[When the winter following this summer shall have terminated, the twenty-first year will be completed.]
