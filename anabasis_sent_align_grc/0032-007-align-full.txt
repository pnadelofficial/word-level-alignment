1.1.1
1
ἔννοιά ποθ’ ἡμῖν ἐγένετο ὅσαι δημοκρατίαι κατελύθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλως πως βουλομένων πολιτεύεσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ , ὅσαι τ’ αὖ μοναρχίαι , ὅσαι τε ὀλιγαρχίαι ἀνῄρηνται ἤδη ὑπὸ δήμων , καὶ ὅσοι τυραννεῖν ἐπιχειρήσαντες οἱ μὲν αὐτῶν καὶ ταχὺ πάμπαν κατελύθησαν , οἱ δὲ κἂν ὁποσονοῦν χρόνον ἄρχοντες διαγένωνται , θαυμάζονται ὡς σοφοί τε καὶ εὐτυχεῖς ἄνδρες γεγενημένοι .
The thought once occurred to us how many republics have been overthrown by people who preferred to live under any form of government other than a republican, and again, how many monarchies and how many oligarchies in times past have been abolished by the people. We reflected, moreover, how many of those individuals who have aspired to absolute power have either been deposed once for all and that right quickly; or if they have continued in power, no matter for how short a time, they are objects of wonder as having proved to be wise and happy men.


1.1.1
2
πολλοὺς δ’ ἐδοκοῦμεν καταμεμαθηκέναι καὶ ἐν ἰδίοις οἴκοις τοὺς μὲν ἔχοντας καὶ πλείονας οἰκέτας , τοὺς δὲ καὶ πάνυ ὀλίγους , καὶ ὅμως οὐδὲ τοῖς ὀλίγοις τούτοις πάνυ τι δυναμένους χρῆσθαι πειθομένοις τοὺς δεσπότας .
Then, too, we had observed, we thought, that even in private homes some people who had rather more than the usual number of servants and some also who had only a very few were nevertheless, though nominally masters, quite unable to assert their authority over even those few.


1.1.2
3
ἔτι δὲ πρὸς τούτοις ἐνενοοῦμεν ὅτι ἄρχοντες μέν εἰσι καὶ οἱ βουκόλοι τῶν βοῶν καὶ οἱ ἱπποφορβοὶ τῶν ἵππων , καὶ πάντες δὲ οἱ καλούμενοι νομεῖς ὧν ἂν ἐπιστατῶσι ζῴων εἰκότως ἂν ἄρχοντες τούτων νομίζοιντο ·
And in addition to this, we reflected that cowherds are the rulers of their cattle, that grooms are the rulers of their horses, and that all who are called herdsmen might properly be regarded as the rulers of the animals over which they are placed in charge.


1.1.2
4
πάσας τοίνυν ταύτας τὰς ἀγέλας ἐδοκοῦμεν ὁρᾶν μᾶλλον ἐθελούσας πείθεσθαι τοῖς νομεῦσιν ἢ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοῖς ἄρχουσι .
Now we noticed, as we thought, that all these herds obeyed their keepers more readily than men obey their rulers.


1.1.2
5
πορεύονταί τε γὰρ αἱ ἀγέλαι ᾗ ἂν αὐτὰς εὐθύνωσιν οἱ νομεῖς , νέμονταί τε χωρία ἐφ’ ὁποῖα ἂν αὐτὰς ἐπάγωσιν , ἀπέχονταί τε ὧν ἂν αὐτὰς ἀπείργωσι ·
For the herds go wherever their keeper directs them and graze in those places to which he leads them and keep out of those from which he excludes them.


1.1.2
6
καὶ τοῖς καρποῖς τοίνυν τοῖς γιγνομένοις ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐῶσι τοὺς νομέας χρῆσθαι οὕτως ὅπως ἂν αὐτοὶ βούλωνται .
They allow their keeper, moreover, to enjoy, just as he will, the profits that accrue from them.


1.1.2
7
ἔτι τοίνυν οὐδεμίαν πώποτε ἀγέλην ᾐσθήμεθα συστᾶσαν ἐπὶ τὸν νομέα οὔτε ὡς μὴ πείθεσθαι οὔτε ὡς μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ καρπῷ χρῆσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ χαλεπώτεραί εἰσιν αἱ ἀγέλαι πᾶσι τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις ἢ τοῖς ἄρχουσί τε καὶ ὠφελουμένοις ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ·
And then again, we have never known of a herd conspiring against its keeper, either to refuse obedience to him or to deny him the privilege of enjoying the profits that accrue.


1.1.2
8
ἄνθρωποι δὲ ἐπ’ οὐδένας μᾶλλον συνίστανται ἢ ἐπὶ τούτους οὓς ἂν αἴσθωνται ἄρχειν αὑτῶν ἐπιχειροῦντας .
At the same time, herds are more intractable to strangers than to their rulers and those who derive profit from them. Men, however, conspire against none sooner than against those whom they see attempting to rule over them.


1.1.3
9
ὅτε μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἐνεθυμούμεθα , οὕτως ἐγιγνώσκομεν περὶ αὐτῶν , ὡς ἀνθρώπῳ πεφυκότι πάντων τῶν ἄλλων ῥᾷον εἴη ζῴων ἢ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν .
Thus, as we meditated on this analogy, we were inclined to conclude that for man, as he is constituted, it is easier to rule over any and all other creatures than to rule over men.


1.1.3
10
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐνενοήσαμεν ὅτι Κῦρος ἐγένετο Πέρσης , ὃς παμπόλλους μὲν ἀνθρώπους ἐκτήσατο πειθομένους αὑτῷ , παμπόλλας δὲ πόλεις , πάμπολλα δὲ ἔθνη , ἐκ τούτου δὴ ἠναγκαζόμεθα μετανοεῖν μὴ οὔτε τῶν ἀδυνάτων οὔτε τῶν χαλεπῶν ἔργων ᾖ τὸ ἀνθρώπων ἄρχειν , ἤν τις ἐπισταμένως τοῦτο πράττῃ .
But when we reflected that there was one Cyrus, the Persian, who reduced to obedience a vast number of men and cities and nations, we were then compelled to change our opinion and decide that to rule men might be a task neither impossible nor even difficult, if one should only go about it in an intelligent manner.


1.1.3
11
Κύρῳ γοῦν ἴσμεν ἐθελήσαντας πείθεσθαι τοὺς μὲν ἀπέχοντας παμπόλλων ἡμερῶν ὁδόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ μηνῶν , τοὺς δὲ οὐδ’ ἑωρακότας πώποτ’ αὐτόν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ εὖ εἰδότας ὅτι οὐδ’ ἂν ἴδοιεν , καὶ ὅμως ἤθελον αὐτῷ ὑπακούειν .
At all events, we know that people obeyed Cyrus willingly, although some of them were distant from him a journey of many days, and others of many months; others, although they had never seen him, and still others who knew well that they never should see him. Nevertheless, they were all willing to be his subjects.


1.1.4
12
καὶ γάρ τοι τοσοῦτον διήνεγκε τῶν ἄλλων βασιλέων , καὶ τῶν πατρίους ἀρχὰς παρειληφότων καὶ τῶν δι’ ἑαυτῶν κτησαμένων , ὥσθ’ ὁ μὲν Σκύθης καίπερ παμπόλλων ὄντων Σκυθῶν ἄλλου μὲν οὐδενὸς δύναιτ’ ἂν ἔθνους ἐπάρξαι , ἀγαπῴη δ’ ἂν εἰ τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ ἔθνους ἄρχων διαγένοιτο , καὶ ὁ Θρᾷξ Θρᾳκῶν καὶ ὁ Ἰλλυριὸς Ἰλλυριῶν , καὶ τ- ἄλλα δὲ ὡσαύτως ἔθνη ἀκούομεν τὰ γοῦν ἐν τῇ Εὐρώπῃ ἔτι καὶ νῦν αὐτόνομα εἶναι λέγεται καὶ λελύσθαι ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων ·
But all this is not so surprising after all, so very different was he from all other kings, both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers and those who have gained their crowns by their own efforts; the Scythian king, for instance, would never be able to extend his rule over any other nation besides his own, although the Scythians are very numerous, but he would be well content if he could maintain himself in power over his own people; so the Thracian king with his Thracians, the Illyrian with his Illyrians, and so also all other nations, we are told.


1.1.4
13
Κῦρος δὲ παραλαβὼν ὡσαύτως οὕτω καὶ τὰ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ ἔθνη αὐτόνομα ὄντα ὁρμηθεὶς σὺν ὀλίγῃ Περσῶν στρατιᾷ ἑκόντων μὲν ἡγήσατο Μήδων , ἑκόντων δὲ Ὑρκανίων , κατεστρέψατο δὲ Σύρους , Ἀσσυρίους , Ἀραβίους , Καππαδόκας , Φρύγας ἀμφοτέρους , Λυδούς , Κᾶρας , Φοίνικας , Βαβυλωνίους , ἦρξε δὲ Βακτρίων καὶ Ἰνδῶν καὶ Κιλίκων , ὡσαύτως δὲ Σακῶν καὶ Παφλαγόνων καὶ Μαγαδιδῶν , καὶ ἄλλων δὲ παμπόλλων ἐθνῶν , ὧν οὐδ’ ἂν τὰ ὀνόματα ἔχοι τις εἰπεῖν , ἐπῆρξε δὲ καὶ Ἑλλήνων τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ , καταβὰς δ’ ἐπὶ θάλατταν καὶ Κυπρίων καὶ Αἰγυπτίων .
Those in Europe, at any rate, are said to be free and independent of one another even to this day. But Cyrus, finding the nations in Asia also independent in exactly the same way, started out with a little band of Persians and became the leader of the Medes by their full consent and of the Hyrcanians by theirs; he then conquered Syria, Assyria, Arabia, Cappadocia, both Phrygias, Lydia, Caria, Phoenicia, and Babylonia; he ruled also over Bactria, India, and Cilicia; and he was likewise king of the Sacians, Paphlagonians, Magadidae, and very many other nations, of which one could not even tell the names; he brought under his sway the Asiatic Greeks also; and, descending to the sea, he added both Cyprus and Egypt to his empire.


1.1.5
14
καὶ τοίνυν τούτων τῶν ἐθνῶν ἦρξεν οὔτε αὐτῷ ὁμογλώττων ὄντων οὔτε ἀλλήλοις , καὶ ὅμως ἐδυνάσθη ἐφικέσθαι μὲν ἐπὶ τοσαύτην γῆν τῷ ἀφ’ ἑαυτοῦ φόβῳ , ὥστε καταπλῆξαι πάντας καὶ μηδένα ἐπιχειρεῖν αὐτῷ , ἐδυνάσθη δὲ ἐπιθυμίαν ἐμβαλεῖν τοσαύτην τοῦ πάντας αὐτῷ χαρίζεσθαι ὥστε ἀεὶ τῇ αὐτοῦ γνώμῃ ἀξιοῦν κυβερνᾶσθαι , ἀνηρτήσατο δὲ τοσαῦτα φῦλα ὅσα καὶ διελθεῖν ἔργον ἐστίν , ὅποι ἂν ἄρξηταί τις πορεύεσθαι ἀπὸ τῶν βασιλείων , ἤν τε πρὸς ἕω ἤν τε πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἤν τε πρὸς ἄρκτον ἤν τε πρὸς μεσημβρίαν .
He ruled over these nations, even though they did not speak the same language as he, nor one nation the same as another; for all that, he was able to cover so vast a region with the fear which he inspired, that he struck all men with terror and no one tried to withstand him; and he was able to awaken in all so lively a desire to please him, that they always wished to be guided by his will. Moreover, the tribes that he brought into subjection to himself were so many that it is a difficult matter even to travel to them all, in whatever direction one begin one’s journey from the palace, whether toward the east or the west, toward the north or the south.


1.1.6
15
ἡμεῖς μὲν δὴ ὡς ἄξιον ὄντα θαυμάζεσθαι τοῦτον τὸν ἄνδρα ἐσκεψάμεθα τίς ποτ’ ὢν γενεὰν καὶ ποίαν τινὰ φύσιν ἔχων καὶ ποίᾳ τινὶ παιδευθεὶς παιδείᾳ τοσοῦτον διήνεγκεν εἰς τὸ ἄρχειν ἀνθρώπων .
Believing this man to be deserving of all admiration, we have therefore investigated who he was in his origin, what natural endowments he possessed, and what sort of education he had enjoyed, that he so greatly excelled in governing men.


1.1.6
16
ὅσα οὖν καὶ ἐπυθόμεθα καὶ ᾐσθῆσθαι δοκοῦμεν περὶ αὐτοῦ , ταῦτα πειρασόμεθα διηγήσασθαι .
Accordingly, what we have found out or think we know concerning him we shall now endeavour to present.


1.2.1
17
πατρὸς μὲν δὴ ὁ Κῦρος λέγεται γενέσθαι Καμβύσου Περσῶν βασιλέως ·
The father of Cyrus is said to have been Cambyses, king of the Persians:


1.2.1
18
ὁ δὲ Καμβύσης οὗτος τοῦ Περσειδῶν γένους ἦν ·
this Cambyses belonged to the stock of the Persidae,


1.2.1
19
οἱ δὲ Περσεῖδαι ἀπὸ Περσέως κλῄζονται ·
and the Persidae derive their name from Perseus.


1.2.1
20
μητρὸς δὲ ὁμολογεῖται Μανδάνης γενέσθαι ·
His mother, it is generally agreed, was Mandane;


1.2.1
21
ἡ δὲ Μανδάνη αὕτη Ἀστυάγους ἦν θυγάτηρ τοῦ Μήδων γενομένου βασιλέως .
and this Mandane was the daughter of Astyages, sometime king of the Medes.


1.2.1
22
φῦναι δὲ ὁ Κῦρος λέγεται καὶ ᾄδεται ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὑπὸ τῶν βαρβάρων εἶδος μὲν κάλλιστος , ψυχὴν δὲ φιλανθρωπότατος καὶ φιλομαθέστατος καὶ φιλοτιμότατος , ὥστε πάντα μὲν πόνον ἀνατλῆναι , πάντα δὲ κίνδυνον ὑπομεῖναι τοῦ ἐπαινεῖσθαι ἕνεκα .
And even to this day the barbarians tell in story and in song that Cyrus was most handsome in person, most generous of heart, most devoted to learning, and most ambitious, so that he endured all sorts of labour and faced all sorts of danger for the sake of praise.


1.2.2
23
φύσιν μὲν δὴ τῆς μορφῆς καὶ τῆς ψυχῆς τοιαύτην ἔχων διαμνημονεύεται ·
Such then were the natural endowments, physical and spiritual, that he is reputed to have had;


1.2.2
24
ἐπαιδεύθη γε μὴν ἐν Περσῶν νόμοις ·
but he was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians;


1.2.2
25
οὗτοι δὲ δοκοῦσιν οἱ νόμοι ἄρχεσθαι τοῦ κοινοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἐπιμελούμενοι οὐκ ἔνθενπερ ἐν ταῖς πλείσταις πόλεσιν ἄρχονται .
and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states.


1.2.2
26
αἱ μὲν γὰρ πλεῖσται πόλεις ἀφεῖσαι παιδεύειν ὅπως τις ἐθέλει τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας , καὶ αὐτοὺς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὅπως ἐθέλουσι διάγειν , ἔπειτα προστάττουσιν αὐτοῖς μὴ κλέπτειν μηδὲ ἁρπάζειν , μὴ βίᾳ εἰς οἰκίαν παριέναι , μὴ παίειν ὃν μὴ δίκαιον , μὴ μοιχεύειν , μὴ ἀπειθεῖν ἄρχοντι , καὶ τ- ἄλλα τὰ τοιαῦτα ὡσαύτως ·
For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will, and the older people themselves to live as they please; and then they command them not to steal and not to rob, not to break into anybody’s house, not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike, not to commit adultery, not to disobey an officer, and so forth;


1.2.2
27
ἢν δέ τις τούτων τι παραβαίνῃ , ζημίαν αὐτοῖς ἐπέθεσαν .
and if a man transgress anyone one of these laws, they punish him.


1.2.3
28
οἱ δὲ Περσικοὶ νόμοι προλαβόντες ἐπιμέλονται ὅπως τὴν ἀρχὴν μὴ τοιοῦτοι ἔσονται οἱ πολῖται οἷοι πονηροῦ τινος ἢ αἰσχροῦ ἔργου ἐφίεσθαι .
The Persian laws, however, begin at the beginning and take care that from the first their citizens shall not be of such a character as ever to desire anything improper or immoral;


1.2.3
29
ἐπιμέλονται δὲ ὧδε .
and the measures they take are as follows.


1.2.3
30
ἔστιν αὐτοῖς ἐλευθέρα ἀγορὰ καλουμένη , ἔνθα τά τε βασίλεια καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἀρχεῖα πεποίηται .
They have their so-called Free Square, where the royal palace and other government buildings are located.


1.2.3
31
ἐντεῦθεν τὰ μὲν ὤνια καὶ οἱ ἀγοραῖοι καὶ αἱ τούτων φωναὶ καὶ ἀπειροκαλίαι ἀπελήλανται εἰς ἄλλον τόπον , ὡς μὴ μιγνύηται ἡ τούτων τύρβη τῇ τῶν πεπαιδευμένων εὐκοσμίᾳ .
The hucksters with their wares, their cries, and their vulgarities are excluded from this and relegated to another part of the city, in order that their tumult may not intrude upon the orderly life of the cultured.


1.2.4
32
διῄρηται δὲ αὕτη ἡ ἀγορὰ ἡ περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα τέτταρα μέρη ·
This square, enclosing the government buildings, is divided into four parts;


1.2.4
33
τούτων δ’ ἔστιν ἓν μὲν παισίν , ἓν δὲ ἐφήβοις , ἄλλο τελείοις ἀνδράσιν , ἄλλο τοῖς ὑπὲρ τὰ στρατεύσιμα ἔτη γεγονόσι .
one of these belongs to the boys, one to the youths, another to the men of mature years, and another to those who are past the age for military service.


1.2.4
34
νόμῳ δ’ εἰς τὰς ἑαυτῶν χώρας ἕκαστοι τούτων πάρεισιν , οἱ μὲν παῖδες ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ καὶ οἱ τέλειοι ἄνδρες , οἱ δὲ γεραίτεροι ἡνίκ’ ἂν ἑκάστῳ προχωρῇ , πλὴν ἐν ταῖς τεταγμέναις ἡμέραις , ἐν αἷς αὐτοὺς δεῖ παρεῖναι .
And the laws require them to come daily to their several quarters — the boys and the full-grown men at daybreak; but the elders may come at whatever time it suits each one’s convenience, except that they must present themselves on certain specified days.


1.2.4
35
οἱ δὲ ἔφηβοι καὶ κοιμῶνται περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα σὺν τοῖς γυμνητικοῖς ὅπλοις πλὴν τῶν γεγαμηκότων ·
But the youths pass the night also in light armour about the government buildings — all except those who are married;


1.2.4
36
οὗτοι δὲ οὔτε ἐπιζητοῦνται , ἢν μὴ προρρηθῇ παρεῖναι , οὔτε πολλάκις ἀπεῖναι καλόν .
no inquiry is made for such, unless they be especially ordered in advance to be there, but it is not proper for them to be absent too often.


1.2.5
37
ἄρχοντες δ’ ἐφ’ ἑκάστῳ τούτων τῶν μερῶν εἰσι δώδεκα ·
Over each of these divisions there are twelve officers,


1.2.5
38
δώδεκα γὰρ καὶ Περσῶν φυλαὶ διῄρηνται .
for the Persians are divided into twelve tribes.


1.2.5
39
καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν τοῖς παισὶν ἐκ τῶν γεραιτέρων ᾑρημένοι εἰσὶν οἳ ἂν δοκῶσι τοὺς παῖδας βελτίστους ἀποδεικνύναι ·
To have charge of the boys, such are chosen from the ranks of the elders as seem likely to make out of the boys the best men;


1.2.5
40
ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς ἐφήβοις ἐκ τῶν τελείων ἀνδρῶν οἳ ἂν αὖ τοὺς ἐφήβους βελτίστους δοκῶσι παρέχειν ·
to have charge of the youths, such are chosen from the ranks of the mature men as seem most likely on their part to develop the youths best;


1.2.5
41
ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς τελείοις ἀνδράσιν οἳ ἂν δοκῶσι παρέχειν αὐτοὺς μάλιστα τὰ τεταγμένα ποιοῦντας καὶ τὰ παραγγελλόμενα ὑπὸ τῆς μεγίστης ἀρχῆς ·
to preside over the mature men, those are selected who seem most likely to fit them best to execute the orders and requirements of the highest authorities;


1.2.5
42
εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ τῶν γεραιτέρων προστάται ᾑρημένοι , οἳ προστατεύουσιν ὅπως καὶ οὗτοι τὰ καθήκοντα ἀποτελῶσιν .
and of the elders also chiefs are selected who act as overseers to see that those of this class also do their duty.


1.2.5
43
ἃ δὲ ἑκάστῃ ἡλικίᾳ προστέτακται ποιεῖν διηγησόμεθα , ὡς μᾶλλον δῆλον γένηται ᾗ ἐπιμέλονται ὡς ἂν βέλτιστοι εἶεν οἱ πολῖται .
And what duties are assigned to each age to perform we shall now set forth, that it may be better understood what pains the Persians take that their citizens may prove to be the very best.


1.2.6
44
οἱ μὲν δὴ παῖδες εἰς τὰ διδασκαλεῖα φοιτῶντες διάγουσι μανθάνοντες δικαιοσύνην ·
The boys go to school and spend their time in learning justice;


1.2.6
45
καὶ λέγουσιν ὅτι ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἔρχονται ὥσπερ παρ’ ἡμῖν ὅτι γράμματα μαθησόμενοι .
and they say that they go there for this purpose, just as in our country they say that they go to learn to read and write.


1.2.6
46
οἱ δ’ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν διατελοῦσι τὸ πλεῖστον τῆς ἡμέρας δικάζοντες αὐτοῖς .
And their officers spend the greater part of the day in deciding cases for them.


1.2.6
47
γίγνεται γὰρ δὴ καὶ παισὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ὥσπερ ἀνδράσιν ἐγκλήματα καὶ κλοπῆς καὶ ἁρπαγῆς καὶ βίας καὶ ἀπάτης καὶ κακολογίας καὶ ἄλλων οἵων δὴ εἰκός .
For, as a matter of course, boys also prefer charges against one another, just as men do, of theft, robbery, assault, cheating, slander, and other things that naturally come up;


1.2.7
48
οὓς δ’ ἂν γνῶσι τούτων τι ἀδικοῦντας , τιμωροῦνται .
and when they discover any one committing any of these crimes, they punish him,


1.2.7
49
κολάζουσι δὲ καὶ ὃν ἂν ἀδίκως ἐγκαλοῦντα εὑρίσκωσι .
and they punish also any one whom they find accusing another falsely.


1.2.7
50
δικάζουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκλήματος οὗ ἕνεκα ἄνθρωποι μισοῦσι μὲν ἀλλήλους μάλιστα , δικάζονται δὲ ἥκιστα , ἀχαριστίας , καὶ ὃν ἂν γνῶσι δυνάμενον μὲν χάριν ἀποδιδόναι , μὴ ἀποδιδόντα δέ , κολάζουσι καὶ τοῦτον ἰσχυρῶς .
And they bring one another to trial also charged with an offence for which people hate one another most but go to law least, namely, that of ingratitude; and if they know that any one is able to return a favour and fails to do so, they punish him also severely.


1.2.7
51
οἴονται γὰρ τοὺς ἀχαρίστους καὶ περὶ θεοὺς ἂν μάλιστα ἀμελῶς ἔχειν καὶ περὶ γονέας καὶ πατρίδα καὶ φίλους .
For they think that the ungrateful are likely to be most neglectful of their duty toward their gods, their parents, their country, and their friends;


1.2.7
52
ἕπεσθαι δὲ δοκεῖ μάλιστα τῇ ἀχαριστίᾳ ἡ ἀναισχυντία ·
for it seems that shamelessness goes hand in hand with ingratitude;


1.2.7
53
καὶ γὰρ αὕτη μεγίστη δοκεῖ εἶναι ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ αἰσχρὰ ἡγεμών .
and it is that, we know, which leads the way to every moral wrong.


1.2.8
54
διδάσκουσι δὲ τοὺς παῖδας καὶ σωφροσύνην ·
They teach the boys self-control also;


1.2.8
55
μέγα δὲ συμβάλλεται εἰς τὸ μανθάνειν σωφρονεῖν αὐτοὺς ὅτι καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὁρῶσιν ἀνὰ πᾶσαν ἡμέραν σωφρόνως διάγοντας .
and it greatly conduces to their learning self-control that they see their elders also living temperately day by day.


1.2.8
56
διδάσκουσι δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ πείθεσθαι τοῖς ἄρχουσι ·
And they teach them likewise to obey the officers;


1.2.8
57
μέγα δὲ καὶ εἰς τοῦτο συμβάλλεται ὅτι ὁρῶσι τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους πειθομένους τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἰσχυρῶς .
and it greatly conduces to this also that they see their elders implicitly obeying their officers.


1.2.8
58
διδάσκουσι δὲ καὶ ἐγκράτειαν γαστρὸς καὶ ποτοῦ ·
And besides, they teach them self-restraint in eating and drinking;


1.2.8
59
μέγα δὲ καὶ εἰς τοῦτο συμβάλλεται ὅτι ὁρῶσι τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους οὐ πρόσθεν ἀπιόντας γαστρὸς ἕνεκα πρὶν ἂν ἀφῶσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες , καὶ ὅτι οὐ παρὰ μητρὶ σιτοῦνται οἱ παῖδες , ἀλλὰ παρὰ τῷ διδασκάλῳ , ὅταν οἱ ἄρχοντες σημήνωσι .
and it greatly conduces to this also that they see that their elders do not leave their post to satisfy their hunger until the officers dismiss them;


1.2.8
60
φέρονται δὲ οἴκοθεν σῖτον μὲν ἄρτον , ὄψον δὲ κάρδαμον , πιεῖν δέ , ἤν τις διψῇ , κώθωνα , ὡς ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀρύσασθαι .
and the same end is promoted by the fact that the boys do not eat with their mothers but with their teachers, from the time the officers so direct.


1.2.8
61
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις μανθάνουσι καὶ τοξεύειν καὶ ἀκοντίζειν .
Furthermore, they bring from home bread for their food, cress for a relish, and for drinking, if any one is thirsty, a cup to draw water from the river.


1.2.8
62
μέχρι μὲν δὴ ἓξ ἢ ἑπτακαίδεκα ἐτῶν ἀπὸ γενεᾶς οἱ παῖδες ταῦτα πράττουσιν , ἐκ τούτου δὲ εἰς τοὺς ἐφήβους ἐξέρχονται .
Besides this, they learn to shoot and to throw the spear. This, then, is what the boys do until they are sixteen or seventeen years of age, and after this they are promoted from the class of boys and enrolled among the young men.


1.2.9
63
οὗτοι δ’ αὖ οἱ ἔφηβοι διάγουσιν ὧδε .
Now the young men in their turn live as follows:


1.2.9
64
δέκα ἔτη ἀφ’ οὗ ἂν ἐκ παίδων ἐξέλθωσι κοιμῶνται μὲν περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα , ὥσπερ προειρήκαμεν , καὶ φυλακῆς ἕνεκα τῆς πόλεως καὶ σωφροσύνης ·
for ten years after they are promoted from the class of boys they pass the nights, as we said before, about the government buildings. This they do for the sake of guarding the city and of developing their powers of self-control;


1.2.9
65
δοκεῖ γὰρ αὕτη ἡ ἡλικία μάλιστα ἐπιμελείας δεῖσθαι ·
for this time of life, it seems, demands the most watchful care.


1.2.9
66
παρέχουσι δὲ καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἄρχουσι χρῆσθαι ἤν τι δέωνται ὑπὲρ τοῦ κοινοῦ .
And during the day, too, they put themselves at the disposal of the authorities, if they are needed for any service to the state.


1.2.9
67
καὶ ὅταν μὲν δέῃ , πάντες μένουσι περὶ τὰ ἀρχεῖα ·
Whenever it is necessary, they all remain about the public buildings.


1.2.9
68
ὅταν δὲ ἐξίῃ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ θήραν , ἐξάγει τὴν ἡμίσειαν τῆς φυλακῆς ·
But when the king goes out hunting, he takes out half the garrison;


1.2.9
69
ποιεῖ δὲ τοῦτο πολλάκις τοῦ μηνός .
and this he does many times a month.


1.2.9
70
ἔχειν δὲ δεῖ τοὺς ἐξιόντας τόξα καὶ παρὰ τὴν φαρέτραν ἐν κολεῷ κοπίδα ἢ σάγαριν , ἔτι δὲ γέρρον καὶ παλτὰ δύο , ὥστε τὸ μὲν ἀφεῖναι , τῷ δ’ , ἂν δέῃ , ἐκ χειρὸς χρῆσθαι .
Those who go must take bow and arrows and, in addition to the quiver, a sabre or bill in its scabbard; they carry along also a light shield and two spears, one to throw, the other to use in case of necessity in a hand-to-hand encounter.


1.2.10
71
διὰ τοῦτο δὲ δημοσίᾳ τοῦ θηρᾶν ἐπιμέλονται , καὶ βασιλεὺς ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ ἡγεμών ἐστιν αὐτοῖς καὶ αὐτός τε θηρᾷ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιμελεῖται ὅπως ἂν θηρῶσιν , ὅτι ἀληθεστάτη αὐτοῖς δοκεῖ εἶναι αὕτη ἡ μελέτη τῶν πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον .
They provide for such hunting out of the public treasury; and as the king is their leader in war, so he not only takes part in the hunt himself but sees to it that the others hunt, too.


1.2.10
72
καὶ γὰρ πρῲ ἀνίστασθαι ἐθίζει καὶ ψύχη καὶ θάλπη ἀνέχεσθαι , γυμνάζει δὲ καὶ ὁδοιπορίαις καὶ δρόμοις , ἀνάγκη δὲ καὶ τοξεῦσαι θηρίον καὶ ἀκοντίσαι ὅπου ἂν παραπίπτῃ .
The state bears the expense of the hunting for the reason that the training it gives seems to be the best preparation for war itself. For it accustoms them to rise early in the morning and to endure both heat and cold, and it gives them practice in taking long tramps and runs, and they have to shoot or spear a wild beast whenever it comes in their way.


1.2.10
73
καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν δὲ πολλάκις ἀνάγκη θήγεσθαι ὅταν τι τῶν ἀλκίμων θηρίων ἀνθιστῆται ·
And they must often whet their courage when one of the fierce beasts shows fight;


1.2.10
74
παίειν μὲν γὰρ δήπου δεῖ τὸ ὁμόσε γιγνόμενον , φυλάξασθαι δὲ τὸ ἐπιφερόμενον ·
for, of course, they must strike down the animal that comes to close quarters with them, and they must be on their guard against the one that threatens to attack them.


1.2.10
75
ὥστε οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὑρεῖν τί ἐν τῇ θήρᾳ ἄπεστι τῶν ἐν πολέμῳ παρόντων .
In a word, it is not easy to find any quality required in war that is not required also in the chase.


1.2.11
76
ἐξέρχονται δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν ἄριστον ἔχοντες πλέον μέν , ὡς τὸ εἰκός , τῶν παίδων , τ- ἄλλα δὲ ὅμοιον .
When they go out hunting they carry along a lunch, more in quantity than that of the boys, as is proper, but in other respects the same;


1.2.11
77
καὶ θηρῶντες μὲν οὐκ ἂν ἀριστήσαιεν , ἢν δέ τι δεήσῃ ἢ θηρίου ἕνεκα ἐπικαταμεῖναι ἢ ἄλλως ἐθελήσωσι διατρῖψαι περὶ τὴν θήραν , τὸ οὖν ἄριστον τοῦτο δειπνήσαντες τὴν ὑστεραίαν αὖ θηρῶσι μέχρι δείπνου , καὶ μίαν ἄμφω τούτω τὼ ἡμέρα λογίζονται , ὅτι μιᾶς ἡμέρας σῖτον δαπανῶσι .
but they would never think of lunching while they are busy with the chase. If, however, for some reason it is necessary to stay longer on account of the game or if for some other reason they wish to continue longer on the chase, then they make their dinner of this luncheon and hunt again on the following day until dinner time;


1.2.11
78
τοῦτο δὲ ποιοῦσι τοῦ ἐθίζεσθαι ἕνεκα , ἵν’ ἐάν τι καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ δεήσῃ , δύνωνται τ- αὐτὸ ποιεῖν .
and these two days they count as one, because they consume but one day’s provisions. This they do to harden themselves, in order that, if ever it is necessary in war, they may be able to do the same.


1.2.11
79
καὶ ὄψον δὲ τοῦτο ἔχουσιν οἱ τηλικοῦτοι ὅ τι ἂν θηράσωσιν ·
Those of this age have for relish the game that they kill;


1.2.11
80
εἰ δὲ μή , τὸ κάρδαμον .
if they fail to kill any, then cresses.


1.2.11
81
εἰ δέ τις αὐτοὺς οἴεται ἢ ἐσθίειν ἀηδῶς , ὅταν κάρδαμον μόνον ἔχωσιν ἐπὶ τῷ σίτῳ , ἢ πίνειν ἀηδῶς , ὅταν ὕδωρ πίνωσιν , ἀναμνησθήτω πῶς μὲν ἡδὺ μᾶζα καὶ ἄρτος πεινῶντι φαγεῖν , πῶς δὲ ἡδὺ ὕδωρ πιεῖν διψῶντι .
Now, if any one thinks that they do not enjoy eating, when they have only cresses with their bread, or that they do not enjoy drinking when they drink only water, let him remember how sweet barley bread and wheaten bread taste when one is hungry, and how sweet water is to drink when one is thirsty.


1.2.12
82
αἱ δ’ αὖ μένουσαι φυλαὶ διατρίβουσι μελετῶσαι τά τε ἄλλα ἃ παῖδες ὄντες ἔμαθον καὶ τοξεύειν καὶ ἀκοντίζειν , καὶ διαγωνιζόμενοι ταῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους διατελοῦσιν .
The divisions remaining at home, in their turn, pass their time shooting with the bow and hurling the spear and practising all the other arts that they learned when they were boys,


1.2.12
83
εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ δημόσιοι τούτων ἀγῶνες καὶ ἆθλα προτίθεται ·
and they continually engage in contests of this kind with one another.


1.2.12
84
ἐν ᾗ δ’ ἂν τῶν φυλῶν πλεῖστοι ὦσι δαημονέστατοι καὶ ἀνδρικώτατοι καὶ εὐπιστότατοι , ἐπαινοῦσιν οἱ πολῖται καὶ τιμῶσιν οὐ μόνον τὸν νῦν ἄρχοντα αὐτῶν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅστις αὐτοὺς παῖδας ὄντας ἐπαίδευσε .
And there are also public contests of this sort, for which prizes are offered; and whatever division has the greatest number of the most expert, the most manly, and the best disciplined young men, the citizens praise and honour not only its present chief officer but also the one who trained them when they were boys.


1.2.12
85
χρῶνται δὲ τοῖς μένουσι τῶν ἐφήβων αἱ ἀρχαί , ἤν τι ἢ φρουρῆσαι δεήσῃ ἢ κακούργους ἐρευνῆσαι ἢ λῃστὰς ὑποδραμεῖν ἢ καὶ ἄλλο τι ὅσα ἰσχύος ἢ τάχους ἔργα ἐστί .
And of the youths who remain behind, the authorities employ any that they may need, whether for garrison duty or for arresting criminals or for hunting down robbers, or for any other service that demands strength or dispatch.


1.2.12
86
ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οἱ ἔφηβοι πράττουσιν .
Such, then, is the occupation of the youths.


1.2.12
87
ἐπειδὰν δὲ τὰ δέκα ἔτη διατελέσωσιν , ἐξέρχονται εἰς τοὺς τελείους ἄνδρας .
And when they have completed their ten years, they are promoted and enrolled in the class of the mature men.


1.2.13
88
ἀφ’ οὗ δ’ ἂν ἐξέλθωσι χρόνου οὗτοι αὖ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν ἔτη διάγουσιν ὧδε .
And these, in turn, for twenty-five years after the time they are there enrolled, are occupied as follows.


1.2.13
89
πρῶτον μὲν ὥσπερ οἱ ἔφηβοι παρέχουσιν ἑαυτοὺς ταῖς ἀρχαῖς χρῆσθαι , ἤν τι δέῃ ὑπὲρ τοῦ κοινοῦ , ὅσα φρονούντων τε ἤδη ἔργα ἐστὶ καὶ ἔτι δυναμένων .
In the first place, like the youths, they are at the disposal of the authorities, if they are needed in the interest of the commonwealth in any service that requires men who have already attained discretion and are still strong in body.


1.2.13
90
ἢν δέ ποι δέῃ στρατεύεσθαι , τόξα μὲν οἱ οὕτω πεπαιδευμένοι οὐκέτι ἔχοντες οὐδὲ παλτὰ στρατεύονται , τὰ δὲ ἀγχέμαχα ὅπλα καλούμενα , θώρακά τε περὶ τοῖς στέρνοις καὶ γέρρον ἐν τῇ ἀριστερᾷ , οἷόνπερ γράφονται οἱ Πέρσαι ἔχοντες , ἐν δὲ τῇ δεξιᾷ μάχαιραν ἢ κοπίδα .
But if it is necessary to make a military expedition anywhere, those who have been thus educated take the field, no longer with bow and arrows, nor yet with spears, but with what are termed weapons for close conflict — a corselet about their breast, a round shield upon their left arm (such as Persians are represented with in art), and in their right hands a sabre or bill.


1.2.13
91
καὶ αἱ ἀρχαὶ δὲ πᾶσαι ἐκ τούτων καθίστανται πλὴν οἱ τῶν παίδων διδάσκαλοι .
From this division also all the magistrates are selected, except the teachers of the boys.


1.2.13
92
ἐπειδὰν δὲ τὰ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν ἔτη διατελέσωσιν , εἴησαν μὲν ἂν οὗτοι πλέον τι γεγονότες ἢ τὰ πεντήκοντα ἔτη ἀπὸ γενεᾶς ·
And when they have completed the five-and-twenty years, they are, as one would expect, somewhat more than fifty years of age;


1.2.13
93
ἐξέρχονται δὲ τηνικαῦτα εἰς τοὺς γεραιτέρους ὄντας τε καὶ καλουμένους .
and then they come out and take their places among those who really are, as they are called, the elders.


1.2.14
94
οἱ δ’ αὖ γεραίτεροι οὗτοι στρατεύονται μὲν οὐκέτι ἔξω τῆς ἑαυτῶν , οἴκοι δὲ μένοντες δικάζουσι τά τε κοινὰ καὶ τὰ ἴδια πάντα .
Now these elders, in their turn, no longer perform military service outside their own country, but they remain at home and try all sorts of cases, both public and private.


1.2.14
95
καὶ θανάτου δὲ οὗτοι κρίνουσι , καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς οὗτοι πάσας αἱροῦνται ·
They try people indicted for capital offences also, and they elect all the officers.


1.2.14
96
καὶ ἤν τις ἢ ἐν ἐφήβοις ἢ ἐν τελείοις ἀνδράσιν ἐλλίπῃ τι τῶν νομίμων , φαίνουσι μὲν οἱ φύλαρχοι ἕκαστοι καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὁ βουλόμενος , οἱ δὲ γεραίτεροι ἀκούσαντες ἐκκρίνουσιν ·
And if any one, either among the youths or among the mature men, fail in any one of the duties prescribed by law, the respective officers of that division, or any one else who will, may enter complaint, and the elders, when they have heard the case, expel the guilty party;


1.2.14
97
ὁ δὲ ἐκκριθεὶς ἄτιμος διατελεῖ τὸν λοιπὸν βίον .
and the one who has been expelled spends the rest of his life degraded and disfranchised.


1.2.15
98
ἵνα δὲ σαφέστερον δηλωθῇ πᾶσα ἡ Περσῶν πολιτεία , μικρὸν ἐπάνειμι ·
Now, that the whole constitutional policy of the Persians may be more clearly set forth, I will go back a little;


1.2.15
99
νῦν γὰρ ἐν βραχυτάτῳ ἂν δηλωθείη διὰ τὰ προειρημένα .
for now, in the light of what has already been said, it can be given in a very few words.


1.2.15
100
λέγονται μὲν γὰρ Πέρσαι ἀμφὶ τὰς δώδεκα μυριάδας εἶναι ·
It is said that the Persians number about one hundred and twenty thousand men;


1.2.15
101
τούτων δ’ οὐδεὶς ἀπελήλαται νόμῳ τιμῶν καὶ ἀρχῶν , ἀλλ’ ἔξεστι πᾶσι Πέρσαις πέμπειν τοὺς ἑαυτῶν παῖδας εἰς τὰ κοινὰ τῆς δικαιοσύνης διδασκαλεῖα .
and no one of these is by law excluded from holding offices and positions of honour, but all the Persians may send their children to the common schools of justice.


1.2.15
102
ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν δυνάμενοι τρέφειν τοὺς παῖδας ἀργοῦντας πέμπουσιν , οἱ δὲ μὴ δυνάμενοι οὐ πέμπουσιν .
Still, only those do send them who are in a position to maintain their children without work; and those who are not so situated do not.


1.2.15
103
οἳ δ’ ἂν παιδευθῶσι παρὰ τοῖς δημοσίοις διδασκάλοις , ἔξεστιν αὐτοῖς ἐν τοῖς ἐφήβοις νεανισκεύεσθαι , τοῖς δὲ μὴ διαπαιδευθεῖσιν οὕτως οὐκ ἔξεστιν .
And only to such as are educated by the public teachers is it permitted to pass their young manhood in the class of the youths, while to those who have not completed this course of training it is not so permitted.


1.2.15
104
οἳ δ’ ἂν αὖ ἐν τοῖς ἐφήβοις διατελέσωσι τὰ νόμιμα ποιοῦντες , ἔξεστι τούτοις εἰς τοὺς τελείους ἄνδρας συναλίζεσθαι καὶ ἀρχῶν καὶ τιμῶν μετέχειν , οἳ δ’ ἂν μὴ διαγένωνται ἐν τοῖς ἐφήβοις , οὐκ εἰσέρχονται εἰς τοὺς τελείους .
And only to such among the youths as complete the course required by law is it permitted to join the class of mature men and to fill offices and places of distinction, while those who do not finish their course among the young men are not promoted to the class of the mature men.


1.2.15
105
οἳ δ’ ἂν αὖ ἐν τοῖς τελείοις διαγένωνται ἀνεπίληπτοι , οὗτοι τῶν γεραιτέρων γίγνονται .
And again, those who finish their course among the mature men without blame become members of the class of elders.


1.2.15
106
οὕτω μὲν δὴ οἱ γεραίτεροι διὰ πάντων τῶν καλῶν ἐληλυθότες καθίστανται ·
So, we see, the elders are made up to those who have enjoyed all honour and distinction.


1.2.15
107
καὶ ἡ πολιτεία αὕτη , ᾗ οἴονται χρώμενοι βέλτιστοι ἂν εἶναι .
This is the policy by the observance of which they think that their citizens may become the best.


1.2.16
108
καὶ νῦν δὲ ἔτι ἐμμένει μαρτύρια καὶ τῆς μετρίας διαίτης αὐτῶν καὶ τοῦ ἐκπονεῖσθαι τὴν δίαιταν .
There remains even unto this day evidence of their moderate fare and of their working off by exercise what they eat:


1.2.16
109
αἰσχρὸν μὲν γὰρ ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐστι Πέρσαις καὶ τὸ πτύειν καὶ τὸ ἀπομύττεσθαι καὶ τὸ φύσης μεστοὺς φαίνεσθαι , αἰσχρὸν δέ ἐστι καὶ τὸ ἰόντα ποι φανερὸν γενέσθαι ἢ τοῦ οὐρῆσαι ἕνεκα ἢ καὶ ἄλλου τινὸς τοιούτου .
for even to the present time it is a breach of decorum for a Persian to spit or to blow his nose or to appear afflicted with flatulence; it is a breach of decorum also to be seen going apart either to make water or for anything else of that kind.


1.2.16
110
ταῦτα δὲ οὐκ ἂν ἐδύναντο ποιεῖν , εἰ μὴ καὶ διαίτῃ μετρίᾳ ἐχρῶντο καὶ τὸ ὑγρὸν ἐκπονοῦντες ἀνήλισκον , ὥστε ἄλλῃ πῃ ἀποχωρεῖν .
And this would not be possible for them, if they did not lead an abstemious life and throw off the moisture by hard work, so that it passes off in some other way.


1.2.16
111
ταῦτα μὲν δὴ κατὰ πάντων Περσῶν ἔχομεν λέγειν ·
This, then, is what we have to say in regard to the Persians in general.


1.2.16
112
οὗ δ’ ἕνεκα ὁ λόγος ὡρμήθη , νῦν λέξομεν τὰς Κύρου πράξεις ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ παιδός .
Now, to fulfil the purpose with which our narrative was begun, we shall proceed to relate the history of Cyrus from his childhood on.


1.3.1
113
Κῦρος γὰρ μέχρι μὲν δώδεκα ἐτῶν ἢ ὀλίγῳ πλέον ταύτῃ τῇ παιδείᾳ ἐπαιδεύθη , καὶ πάντων τῶν ἡλίκων διαφέρων ἐφαίνετο καὶ εἰς τὸ ταχὺ μανθάνειν ἃ δέοι καὶ εἰς τὸ καλῶς καὶ ἀνδρείως ἕκαστα ποιεῖν .
Such was the education that Cyrus received until he was twelve years old or a little more; and he showed himself superior to all the other boys of his age both in mastering his tasks quickly and in doing everything in a thorough and manly fashion.


1.3.1
114
ἐκ δὲ τούτου τοῦ χρόνου μετεπέμψατο Ἀστυάγης τὴν ἑαυτοῦ θυγατέρα καὶ τὸν παῖδα αὐτῆς ·
It was at this period of his life that Astyages sent for his daughter and her son;


1.3.1
115
ἰδεῖν γὰρ ἐπεθύμει , ὅτι ἤκουεν αὐτὸν καλὸν κ- ἀγαθὸν εἶναι .
for he was eager to see him, as he had heard from time to time that the child was a handsome boy of rare promise.


1.3.1
116
ἔρχεται δὲ αὐτή τε ἡ Μανδάνη πρὸς τὸν πατέρα καὶ τὸν Κῦρον τὸν υἱὸν ἔχουσα .
As soon as she arrived and Cyrus had recognized in Astyages his mother’s father, being naturally an affectionate boy he at once kissed him, just as a person who had long lived with another and long loved him would do.


1.3.2
117
ὡς δὲ ἀφίκετο τάχιστα καὶ ἔγνω ὁ Κῦρος τὸν Ἀστυάγην τῆς μητρὸς πατέρα ὄντα , εὐθὺς οἷα δὴ παῖς φύσει φιλόστοργος ὢν ἠσπάζετό τε αὐτὸν ὥσπερ ἂν εἴ τις πάλαι συντεθραμμένος καὶ πάλαι φιλῶν ἀσπάζοιτο , καὶ ὁρῶν δὴ αὐτὸν κεκοσμημένον καὶ ὀφθαλμῶν ὑπογραφῇ καὶ χρώματος ἐντρίψει καὶ κόμαις προσθέτοις , ἃ δὴ νόμιμα ἦν ἐν Μήδοις ·
Then he noticed that his grandfather was adorned with pencillings beneath his eyes, with rouge rubbed on his face, and with a wig of false hair — the common Median fashion.


1.3.2
118
ταῦτα γὰρ πάντα Μηδικά ἐστι , καὶ οἱ πορφυροῖ χιτῶνες καὶ οἱ κάνδυες καὶ οἱ στρεπτοὶ οἱ περὶ τῇ δέρῃ καὶ τὰ ψέλια τὰ περὶ ταῖς χερσίν , ἐν Πέρσαις δὲ τοῖς οἴκοι καὶ νῦν ἔτι πολὺ καὶ ἐσθῆτες φαυλότεραι καὶ δίαιται εὐτελέστεραι ·
For all this is Median, and so are their purple tunics, and their mantles, the necklaces about their necks, and the bracelets on their wrists, while the Persians at home even to this day have much plainer clothing and a more frugal way of life.


1.3.2
119
ὁρῶν δὴ τὸν κόσμον τοῦ πάππου , ἐμβλέπων αὐτῷ ἔλεγεν ·
So, observing his grandfather’s adornment and staring at him, he said:


1.3.2
120
ὦ μῆτερ , ὡς καλός μοι ὁ πάππος .
“Oh mother, how handsome my grandfather is!”


1.3.2
121
ἐρωτώσης δὲ αὐτὸν τῆς μητρὸς πότερος καλλίων αὐτῷ δοκεῖ εἶναι , ὁ πατὴρ ἢ οὗτος , ἀπεκρίνατο ἄρα ὁ Κῦρος ·
And when his mother asked him which he thought more handsome, his father or his grandfather, Cyrus answered at once:


1.3.2
122
ὦ μῆτερ , Περσῶν μὲν πολὺ κάλλιστος ὁ ἐμὸς πατήρ , Μήδων μέντοι ὅσων ἑώρακα ἐγὼ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς θύραις πολὺ οὗτος ὁ ἐμὸς πάππος κάλλιστος .
“Of the Persians, mother, my father is much the handsomest; but of the Medes, as far as I have seen them either on the streets or at court, my grandfather here is the handsomest by far.”


1.3.3
123
ἀντασπαζόμενος δὲ ὁ πάππος αὐτὸν καὶ στολὴν καλὴν ἐνέδυσε καὶ στρεπτοῖς καὶ ψελίοις ἐτίμα καὶ ἐκόσμει , καὶ εἴ ποι ἐξελαύνοι , ἐφ’ ἵππου χρυσοχαλίνου περιῆγεν , ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτὸς εἰώθει πορεύεσθαι .
Then his grandfather kissed him in return and gave him a beautiful dress to wear and, as a mark of royal favour, adorned him with necklaces and bracelets;


1.3.3
124
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἅτε παῖς ὢν καὶ φιλόκαλος καὶ φιλότιμος ἥδετο τῇ στολῇ , καὶ ἱππεύειν μανθάνων ὑπερέχαιρεν ·
and if he went out for a ride anywhere, he took the boy along upon a horse with a gold-studded bridle, just as he himself was accustomed to go.


1.3.3
125
ἐν Πέρσαις γὰρ διὰ τὸ χαλεπὸν εἶναι καὶ τρέφειν ἵππους καὶ ἱππεύειν ἐν ὀρεινῇ οὔσῃ τῇ χώρᾳ καὶ ἰδεῖν ἵππον πάνυ σπάνιον ἦν .
And as Cyrus was a boy fond of beautiful things and eager for distinction, he was pleased with his dress and greatly delighted at learning to ride; for in Persia, on account of its being difficult to breed horses and to practise horsemanship because it is a mountainous country, it was a very rare thing even to see a horse.


1.3.4
126
δειπνῶν δὲ δὴ ὁ Ἀστυάγης σὺν τῇ θυγατρὶ καὶ τῷ Κύρῳ , βουλόμενος τὸν παῖδα ὡς ἥδιστα δειπνεῖν , ἵνα ἧττον τὰ οἴκαδε ποθοίη , προσῆγεν αὐτῷ καὶ παροψίδας καὶ παντοδαπὰ ἐμβάμματα καὶ βρώματα .
And then again, when Astyages dined with his daughter and Cyrus, he set before him dainty side-dishes and all sorts of sauces and meats, for he wished the boy to enjoy his dinner as much as possible, in order that he might be less likely to feel homesick.


1.3.4
127
τὸν δὲ Κῦρόν φασι λέγειν ·
And Cyrus, they say, observed:


1.3.4
128
ὦ πάππε , ὅσα πράγματα ἔχεις ἐν τῷ δείπνῳ , εἰ ἀνάγκη σοι ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ λεκάρια ταῦτα διατείνειν τὰς χεῖρας καὶ ἀπογεύεσθαι τούτων τῶν παντοδαπῶν βρωμάτων .
How much trouble you have at your dinner, grandfather, if you have to reach out your hands to all these dishes and taste of all these different kinds of food!


1.3.4
129
τί δέ , φάναι τὸν Ἀστυάγην , οὐ γὰρ πολύ σοι δοκεῖ εἶναι κάλλιον τόδε τὸ δεῖπνον τοῦ ἐν Πέρσαις ;
Why so? said Astyages. Really now, don’t you think this dinner much finer than your Persian dinners?


1.3.4
130
τὸν δὲ Κῦρον πρὸς ταῦτα ἀποκρίνασθαι λέγεται ·
No, grandfather, said Cyrus,


1.3.4
131
οὔκ , ὦ πάππε , ἀλλὰ πολὺ ἁπλουστέρα καὶ εὐθυτέρα παρ’ ἡμῖν ἡ ὁδός ἐστιν ἐπὶ τὸ ἐμπλησθῆναι ἢ παρ’ ὑμῖν ·
but the road to satiety is much more simple and direct in our country than with you;


1.3.4
132
ἡμᾶς μὲν γὰρ ἄρτος καὶ κρέα εἰς τοῦτο ἄγει , ὑμεῖς δὲ εἰς μὲν τὸ αὐτὸ ἡμῖν σπεύδετε , πολλοὺς δέ τινας ἑλιγμοὺς ἄνω καὶ κάτω πλανώμενοι μόλις ἀφικνεῖσθε ὅποι ἡμεῖς πάλαι ἥκομεν .
for bread and meat take us there; but you, though you make for the same goal as we, go wandering through many a maze, up and down, and only arrive at last at the point that we long since have reached.


1.3.5
133
ἀλλ’ , ὦ παῖ , φάναι τὸν Ἀστυάγην , οὐκ ἀχθόμενοι ταῦτα περιπλανώμεθα ·
But, my boy, said Astyages, we do not object to this wandering about;


1.3.5
134
γευόμενος δὲ καὶ σύ , ἔφη , γνώσῃ ὅτι ἡδέα ἐστίν .
and you also, he added, if you taste, will see that it is pleasant.


1.3.5
135
ἀλλὰ καὶ σέ , φάναι τὸν Κῦρον , ὁρῶ , ὦ πάππε , μυσαττόμενον ταῦτα τὰ βρώματα .
But, grandfather, said Cyrus, I observe that even you are disgusted with these viands.


1.3.5
136
καὶ τὸν Ἀστυάγην ἐπερέσθαι ·
And by what, pray, do you judge, my boy? asked Astyages,


1.3.5
137
καὶ τίνι δὴ σὺ τεκμαιρόμενος , ὦ παῖ , λέγεις ;
that you say this?


1.3.5
138
ὅτι σε , φάναι , ὁρῶ , ὅταν μὲν τοῦ ἄρτου ἅψῃ , εἰς οὐδὲν τὴν χεῖρα ἀποψώμενον , ὅταν δὲ τούτων τινὸς θίγῃς , εὐθὺς ἀποκαθαίρει τὴν χεῖρα εἰς τὰ χειρόμακτρα , ὡς πάνυ ἀχθόμενος ὅτι πλέα σοι ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἐγένετο .
Because, said he, I observe that when you touch bread, you do not wipe your hand on anything; but when you touch any of these other things you at once cleanse your hand upon your napkin, as if you were exceedingly displeased that it had become soiled with them.


1.3.6
139
πρὸς ταῦτα δὲ τὸν Ἀστυάγην εἰπεῖν ·
Well then, my boy, Astyages replied to this,


1.3.6
140
εἰ τοίνυν οὕτω γιγνώσκεις , ὦ παῖ , ἀλλὰ κρέα γε εὐωχοῦ , ἵνα νεανίας οἴκαδε ἀπέλθῃς .
if that is your judgment, at least regale yourself with meat, that you may go back home a strong young man.


1.3.6
141
ἅμα δὲ ταῦτα λέγοντα πολλὰ αὐτῷ παραφέρειν καὶ θήρεια καὶ τῶν ἡμέρων .
And as he said this, he placed before him an abundance of meat of both wild and domestic animals.


1.3.6
142
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον , ἐπεὶ ἑώρα πολλὰ τὰ κρέα , εἰπεῖν ·
And when Cyrus saw that there was a great quantity of meat, he said:


1.3.6
143
ἦ καὶ δίδως , φάναι , ὦ πάππε , πάντα ταῦτά μοι τὰ κρέα ὅ τι ἂν βούλωμαι αὐτοῖς χρῆσθαι ;
And do you really mean to give me all this meat, grandfather, to dispose of as I please?


1.3.6
144
νὴ Δία , φάναι , ὦ παῖ , ἔγωγέ σοι .
Yes, by Zeus, said he, I do.


1.3.7
145
ἐνταῦθα δὴ τὸν Κῦρον λαβόντα τῶν κρεῶν διαδιδόναι τοῖς ἀμφὶ τὸν πάππον θεραπευταῖς , ἐπιλέγοντα ἑκάστῳ ·
Thereupon Cyrus took some of the meat and proceeded to distribute it among his grandfather’s servants, saying to them in turn:


1.3.7
146
σοὶ μὲν τοῦτο ὅτι προθύμως με ἱππεύειν διδάσκεις , σοὶ δ’ ὅτι μοι παλτὸν ἔδωκας ·
I give this to you, because you take so much pains to teach me to ride; to you, because you gave me a spear, for at present this is all I have to give;


1.3.7
147
νῦν γὰρ τοῦτ’ ἔχω ·
to you, because you serve my grandfather so well;


1.3.7
148
σοὶ δ’ ὅτι τὸν πάππον καλῶς θεραπεύεις , σοὶ δ’ ὅτι μου τὴν μητέρα τιμᾷς ·
and to you, because you are respectful to my mother.


1.3.7
149
τοιαῦτα ἐποίει , ἕως διεδίδου πάντα ἃ ἔλαβε κρέα .
He kept on thus, while he was distributing all the meat that he had received.


1.3.8
150
Σάκᾳ δέ , φάναι τὸν Ἀστυάγην , τῷ οἰνοχόῳ , ὃν ἐγὼ μάλιστα τιμῶ , οὐδὲν δίδως ;
But, said Astyages, are you not going to give any to Sacas, my cupbearer, whom I like best of all?


1.3.8
151
ὁ δὲ Σάκας ἄρα καλός τε ὢν ἐτύγχανε καὶ τιμὴν ἔχων προσάγειν τοὺς δεομένους Ἀστυάγους καὶ ἀποκωλύειν οὓς μὴ καιρὸς αὐτῷ δοκοίη εἶναι προσάγειν .
Now Sacas, it seems, chanced to be a handsome fellow who had the office of introducing to Astyages those who had business with him and of keeping out those whom he thought it not expedient to admit.


1.3.8
152
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον ἐπερέσθαι προπετῶς ὡς ἂν παῖς μηδέπω ὑποπτήσσων ·
And Cyrus asked pertly, as a boy might do who was not yet at all shy,


1.3.8
153
διὰ τί δή , ὦ πάππε , τοῦτον οὕτω τιμᾷς ;
Pray, grandfather, why do you like this fellow so much?


1.3.8
154
καὶ τὸν Ἀστυάγην σκώψαντα εἰπεῖν ·
And Astyages replied with a jest:


1.3.8
155
οὐχ ὁρᾷς , φάναι , ὡς καλῶς οἰνοχοεῖ καὶ εὐσχημόνως ;
Do you not see, said he, how nicely and gracefully he pours the wine?


1.3.8
156
οἱ δὲ τῶν βασιλέων τούτων οἰνοχόοι κομψῶς τε οἰνοχοοῦσι καὶ καθαρείως ἐγχέουσι καὶ διδόασι τοῖς τρισὶ δακτύλοις ὀχοῦντες τὴν φιάλην καὶ προσφέρουσιν ὡς ἂν ἐνδοῖεν τὸ ἔκπωμα εὐληπτότατα τῷ μέλλοντι πίνειν .
Now the cupbearers of those kings perform their office with fine airs; they pour in the wine with neatness and then present the goblet, conveying it with three fingers, and offer it in such a way as to place it most conveniently in the grasp of the one who is to drink.


1.3.9
157
κέλευσον δή , φάναι , ὦ πάππε , τὸν Σάκαν καὶ ἐμοὶ δοῦναι τὸ ἔκπωμα , ἵνα κ- ἐγὼ καλῶς σοι πιεῖν ἐγχέας ἀνακτήσωμαι σε , ἢν δύνωμαι .
Well, grandfather, said he, bid Sacas give me the cup, that I also may deftly pour for you to drink and thus win your favour, if I can.


1.3.9
158
καὶ τὸν κελεῦσαι δοῦναι .
And he bade him give it.


1.3.9
159
λαβόντα δὲ τὸν Κῦρον οὕτω μὲν δὴ εὖ κλύσαι τὸ ἔκπωμα ὥσπερ τὸν Σάκαν ἑώρα , οὕτω δὲ στήσαντα τὸ πρόσωπον σπουδαίως καὶ εὐσχημόνως πως προσενεγκεῖν καὶ ἐνδοῦναι τὴν φιάλην τῷ πάππῳ ὥστε τῇ μητρὶ καὶ τῷ Ἀστυάγει πολὺν γέλωτα παρασχεῖν .
And Cyrus took the cup and rinsed it out well, exactly as he had often seen Sacas do, and then he brought and presented the goblet to his grandfather, assuming an expression somehow so grave and important, that he made his mother and Astyages laugh heartily.


1.3.9
160
καὶ αὐτὸν δὲ τὸν Κῦρον ἐκγελάσαντα ἀναπηδῆσαι πρὸς τὸν πάππον καὶ φιλοῦντα ἅμα εἰπεῖν ·
And Cyrus himself also with a laugh sprang up into his grandfather’s lap and kissing him said:


1.3.9
161
ὦ Σάκα , ἀπόλωλας ·
Ah, Sacas, you are done for;


1.3.9
162
ἐκβαλῶ σε ἐκ τῆς τιμῆς ·
I shall turn you out of your office;


1.3.9
163
τά τε γὰρ ἄλλα , φάναι , σοῦ κάλλιον οἰνοχοήσω καὶ οὐκ ἐκπίομαι αὐτὸς τὸν οἶνον .
for in other ways, said he, I shall play the cupbearer better than you and besides I shall not drink up the wine myself.


1.3.9
164
οἱ δ’ ἄρα τῶν βασιλέων οἰνοχόοι , ἐπειδὰν διδῶσι τὴν φιάλην , ἀρύσαντες ἀπ’ αὐτῆς τῷ κυάθῳ εἰς τὴν ἀριστερὰν χεῖρα ἐγχεάμενοι καταρροφοῦσι , τοῦ δὴ εἰ φάρμακα ἐγχέοιεν μὴ λυσιτελεῖν αὐτοῖς .
Now, it is a well-known fact that the king’s cupbearers, when they proffer the cup, draw off some of it with the ladle, pour it into their left hand, and swallow it down — so that, if they should put poison in, they may not profit by it.


1.3.10
165
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ὁ Ἀστυάγης ἐπισκώπτων , καὶ τί δή , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , τ- ἄλλα μιμούμενος τὸν Σάκαν οὐ κατερρόφησας τοῦ οἴνου ;
Thereupon Astyages said in jest: And why, pray, Cyrus, did you imitate Sacas in everything else but did not sip any of the wine?


1.3.10
166
ὅτι , ἔφη , νὴ Δία ἐδεδοίκειν μὴ ἐν τῷ κρατῆρι φάρμακα μεμιγμένα εἴη .
Because, by Zeus, said he, I was afraid that poison had been mixed in the bowl.


1.3.10
167
καὶ γὰρ ὅτε εἱστίασας σὺ τοὺς φίλους ἐν τοῖς γενεθλίοις , σαφῶς κατέμαθον φάρμακα ὑμῖν αὐτὸν ἐγχέαντα .
And I had reason to be afraid; for when you entertained your friends on your birthday, I discovered beyond a doubt that he had poured poison into your company’s drink.


1.3.10
168
καὶ πῶς δὴ σὺ τοῦτο , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , κατέγνως ;
And how, pray, said he, did you discover that, my son?


1.3.10
169
ὅτι νὴ Δί’ ὑμᾶς ἑώρων καὶ ταῖς γνώμαις καὶ τοῖς σώμασι σφαλλομένους .
Because, by Zeus, said he, I saw that you were unsteady both in mind and in body.


1.3.10
170
πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ ἃ οὐκ ἐᾶτε ἡμᾶς τοὺς παῖδας ποιεῖν , ταῦτα αὐτοὶ ἐποιεῖτε .
For in the first place you yourselves kept doing what you never allow us boys to do; for instance, you kept shouting, all at the same time, and none of you heard anything that the others were saying;


1.3.10
171
πάντες μὲν γὰρ ἅμα ἐκεκράγειτε , ἐμανθάνετε δὲ οὐδὲν ἀλλήλων , ᾔδετε δὲ καὶ μάλα γελοίως , οὐκ ἀκροώμενοι δὲ τοῦ ᾄδοντος ὠμνύετε ἄριστα ᾄδειν ·
and you fell to singing, and in a most ridiculous manner at that, and though you did not hear the singer, you swore that he sang most excellently;


1.3.10
172
λέγων δὲ ἕκαστος ὑμῶν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ῥώμην , ἔπειτ’ εἰ ἀνασταίητε ὀρχησόμενοι , μὴ ὅπως ὀρχεῖσθαι ἐν ῥυθμῷ , ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ὀρθοῦσθαι ἐδύνασθε .
and though each one of you kept telling stories of his own strength, yet if you stood up to dance, to say nothing of dancing in time, why, you could not even stand up straight.


1.3.10
173
ἐπελέλησθε δὲ παντάπασι σύ τε ὅτι βασιλεὺς ἦσθα , οἵ τε ἄλλοι ὅτι σὺ ἄρχων .
And all of you quite forgot — you, that you were king; and the rest, that you were their sovereign.


1.3.10
174
τότε γὰρ δὴ ἔγωγε καὶ πρῶτον κατέμαθον ὅτι τοῦτ’ ἄρ’ ἦν ἡ ἰσηγορία ὃ ὑμεῖς τότ’ ἐποιεῖτε ·
It was then that I also for my part discovered, and for the first time, that what you were practising was your boasted equal freedom of speech;


1.3.10
175
οὐδέποτε γοῦν ἐσιωπᾶτε .
at any rate, never were any of you silent.


1.3.11
176
καὶ ὁ Ἀστυάγης λέγει ·
Astyages said,


1.3.11
177
ὁ δὲ σὸς πατήρ , ὦ παῖ , πίνων οὐ μεθύσκεται ;
But, my boy, does not your father get drunk, when he drinks?


1.3.11
178
οὐ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη .
No, by Zeus, said he.


1.3.11
179
ἀλλὰ πῶς ποιεῖ ;
Well, how does he manage it?


1.3.11
180
διψῶν παύεται , ἄλλο δὲ κακὸν οὐδὲν πάσχει ·
He just quenches his thirst and thus suffers no further harm;


1.3.11
181
οὐ γάρ , οἶμαι , ὦ πάππε , Σάκας αὐτῷ οἰνοχοεῖ .
for he has, I trow, grandfather, no Sacas to pour wine for him.


1.3.11
182
καὶ ἡ μήτηρ εἶπεν ·
His mother said:


1.3.11
183
ἀλλὰ τί ποτε σύ , ὦ παῖ , τῷ Σάκᾳ οὕτω πολεμεῖς ;
But why in the world, my son, are you so set against Sacas?


1.3.11
184
τὸν δὲ Κῦρον εἰπεῖν ·
Cyrus replied:


1.3.11
185
ὅτι νὴ Δία , φάναι , μισῶ αὐτόν ·
Because, by Zeus, I don’t like him;


1.3.11
186
πολλάκις γάρ με πρὸς τὸν πάππον ἐπιθυμοῦντα προσδραμεῖν οὗτος ὁ μιαρώτατος ἀποκωλύει .
for oftentimes, when I am eager to run in to see my grandfather, this miserable scoundrel keeps me out.


1.3.11
187
ἀλλ’ ἱκετεύω , φάναι , ὦ πάππε , δός μοι τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἄρξαι αὐτοῦ .
But, he added, I beg of you, grandfather, allow me for just three days to rule over him.


1.3.11
188
καὶ τὸν Ἀστυάγην εἰπεῖν ·
Astyages said:


1.3.11
189
καὶ πῶς ἂν ἄρξαις αὐτοῦ ;
And how would you rule over him?


1.3.11
190
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον φάναι ·
Cyrus replied.


1.3.11
191
στὰς ἂν ὥσπερ οὗτος ἐπὶ τῇ εἰσόδῳ , ἔπειτα ὁπότε βούλοιτο παριέναι ἐπ’ ἄριστον , λέγοιμ’ ἂν ὅτι οὔπω δυνατὸν τῷ ἀρίστῳ ἐντυχεῖν ·
I would stand at the door,  just as he does, and then when he wished to come in to luncheon, I would say, You cannot interview the luncheon yet;


1.3.11
192
σπουδάζει γὰρ πρός τινας ·
for it is engaged with certain persons.


1.3.11
193
εἶθ’ ὁπότε ἥκοι ἐπὶ τὸ δεῖπνον , λέγοιμ’ ἂν ὅτι λοῦται ·
And then when he came to dinner, I would say, It is at the bath.


1.3.11
194
εἰ δὲ πάνυ σπουδάζοι φαγεῖν , εἴποιμ’ ἂν ὅτι παρὰ ταῖς γυναιξίν ἐστιν ·
And if he were very eager to eat, I would say, It is with the ladies.


1.3.11
195
ἕως παρατείναιμι τοῦτον ὥσπερ οὗτος ἐμὲ παρατείνει ἀπὸ σοῦ κωλύων .
And I would keep that up until I tormented him, just as he torments me by keeping me away from you.


1.3.12
196
τοσαύτας μὲν αὐτοῖς εὐθυμίας παρεῖχεν ἐπὶ τῷ δείπνῳ ·
Such amusement he furnished them at dinner;


1.3.12
197
τὰς δ’ ἡμέρας , εἴ τινος αἴσθοιτο δεόμενον ἢ τὸν πάππον ἢ τὸν τῆς μητρὸς ἀδελφόν , χαλεπὸν ἦν ἄλλον φθάσαι τοῦτο ποιήσαντα ·
and during the day, if he saw that his grandfather or his uncle needed anything, it was difficult for anyone else to get ahead of him in supplying the need;


1.3.12
198
ὅ τι γὰρ δύναιτο ὁ Κῦρος ὑπερέχαιρεν αὐτοῖς χαριζόμενος .
for Cyrus was most happy to do them any service that he could.


1.3.13
199
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἡ Μανδάνη παρεσκευάζετο ὡς ἀπιοῦσα πάλιν πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα , ἐδεῖτο αὐτῆς ὁ Ἀστυάγης καταλιπεῖν τὸν Κῦρον .
But when Mandane was making preparations to go back to her husband, Astyages asked her to leave Cyrus behind.


1.3.13
200
ἡ δὲ ἀπεκρίνατο ὅτι βούλοιτο μὲν ἅπαντα τῷ πατρὶ χαρίζεσθαι , ἄκοντα μέντοι τὸν παῖδα χαλεπὸν εἶναι νομίζειν καταλιπεῖν .
And she answered that she desired to do her father’s pleasure in everything, but she thought it hard to leave the boy behind against his will.


1.3.13
201
ἔνθα δὴ ὁ Ἀστυάγης λέγει πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον ·
Then Astyages said to Cyrus:


1.3.14
202
ὦ παῖ , ἢν μένῃς παρ’ ἐμοί , πρῶτον μὲν τῆς παρ’ ἐμὲ εἰσόδου σοι οὐ Σάκας ἄρξει , ἀλλ’ ὁπόταν βούλῃ εἰσιέναι ὡς ἐμέ , ἐπὶ σοὶ ἔσται ·
My boy, if you will stay with me, in the first place Sacas shall not control your admission to me, but it shall be in your power to come in to see me whenever you please,


1.3.14
203
καὶ χάριν σοι εἴσομαι ὅσῳ ἂν πλεονάκις εἰσίῃς ὡς ἐμέ .
and I shall be the more obliged to you the oftener you come to me.


1.3.14
204
ἔπειτα δὲ ἵπποις τοῖς ἐμοῖς χρήσῃ καὶ ἄλλοις ὁπόσοις ἂν βούλῃ , καὶ ὁπόταν ἀπίῃς , ἔχων ἄπει οὓς ἂν αὐτὸς ἐθέλῃς .
And in the second place you shall use my horses and everything else you will;   and when you go back home, you shall take with you any of them that you desire.


1.3.14
205
ἔπειτα δὲ ἐν τῷ δείπνῳ ἐπὶ τὸ μετρίως σοι δοκοῦν ἔχειν ὁποίαν βούλει ὁδὸν πορεύσῃ .
And besides, at dinner you shall go whatever way you please to what seems to you to be temperance.


1.3.14
206
ἔπειτα τά τε νῦν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ θηρία δίδωμί σοι καὶ ἄλλα παντοδαπὰ συλλέξω , ἃ σὺ ἐπειδὰν τάχιστα ἱππεύειν μάθῃς , διώξῃ , καὶ τοξεύων καὶ ἀκοντίζων καταβαλεῖς ὥσπερ οἱ μεγάλοι ἄνδρες .
And then, I present to you the animals that are now in the park and I will collect others of every description, and as soon as you learn to ride, you shall hunt and slay them with bow and spear, just as grown-up men do.


1.3.14
207
καὶ παῖδας δέ σοι ἐγὼ συμπαίστορας παρέξω , καὶ ἄλλα ὁπόσα ἂν βούλῃ λέγων πρὸς ἐμὲ οὐκ ἀτυχήσεις .
I will also find some children to be your playfellows; and if you wish anything else, just mention it to me, and you shall not fail to receive it.


1.3.15
208
ἐπεὶ ταῦτα εἶπεν ὁ Ἀστυάγης , ἡ μήτηρ διηρώτα τὸν Κῦρον πότερον βούλοιτο μένειν ἢ ἀπιέναι .
When Astyages had said this, his mother asked Cyrus whether he wished to stay or go.


1.3.15
209
ὁ δὲ οὐκ ἐμέλλησεν , ἀλλὰ ταχὺ εἶπεν ὅτι μένειν βούλοιτο .
And he did not hesitate but said at once that he wished to stay.


1.3.15
210
ἐπερωτηθεὶς δὲ πάλιν ὑπὸ τῆς μητρὸς διὰ τί εἰπεῖν λέγεται ·
And when he was asked again by his mother why he wished to stay, he is said to have answered:


1.3.15
211
ὅτι οἴκοι μὲν τῶν ἡλίκων καὶ εἰμὶ καὶ δοκῶ κράτιστος εἶναι , ὦ μῆτερ , καὶ ἀκοντίζων καὶ τοξεύων , ἐνταῦθα δὲ οἶδ’ ὅτι ἱππεύων ἥττων εἰμὶ τῶν ἡλίκων ·
Because at home, mother, I am and have the reputation of being the best of those of my years both in throwing the spear and in shooting with the bow; but here I know that I am inferior to my fellows in horsemanship.


1.3.15
212
καὶ τοῦτο εὖ ἴσθι , ὦ μῆτερ , ἔφη , ὅτι ἐμὲ πάνυ ἀνιᾷ .
And let me tell you, mother, said he, this vexes me exceedingly.


1.3.15
213
ἢν δέ με καταλίπῃς ἐνθάδε καὶ μάθω ἱππεύειν , ὅταν μὲν ἐν Πέρσαις ὦ , οἶμαί σοι ἐκείνους τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς τὰ πεζικὰ ῥᾳδίως νικήσειν , ὅταν δ’ εἰς Μήδους ἔλθω , ἐνθάδε πειράσομαι τῷ πάππῳ ἀγαθῶν ἱππέων κράτιστος ὢν ἱππεὺς συμμαχεῖν αὐτῷ .
But if you leave me here and I learn to ride, I think you will find, when I come back to Persia, that I shall easily surpass the boys over there who are good at exercises on foot, and when I come again to Media, I shall try to be a help to my grandfather by being the best of good horsemen.


1.3.15
214
τὴν δὲ μητέρα εἰπεῖν ·
And his mother said:


1.3.16
215
τὴν δὲ δικαιοσύνην , ὦ παῖ , πῶς μαθήσῃ ἐνθάδε ἐκεῖ ὄντων σοι τῶν διδασκάλων ;
My boy, how will you learn justice here, while your teachers are over there?


1.3.16
216
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον φάναι ·
Cyrus answered:


1.3.16
217
ἀλλ’ , ὦ μῆτερ , ἀκριβῶς ταῦτά γε οἶδα .
Why, mother,  that is one thing that I understand thoroughly.


1.3.16
218
πῶς σὺ οἶσθα ;
How so? said Mandane.


1.3.16
219
τὴν Μανδάνην εἰπεῖν .
Because said he,


1.3.16
220
ὅτι , φάναι , ὁ διδάσκαλός με ὡς ἤδη ἀκριβοῦντα τὴν δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἄλλοις καθίστη δικάζειν .
my teacher appointed me, on the ground that I was already thoroughly versed in justice, to decide cases for others also.


1.3.16
221
καὶ τοίνυν , φάναι , ἐπὶ μιᾷ ποτε δίκῃ πληγὰς ἔλαβον ὡς οὐκ ὀρθῶς δικάσας .
And so, in one case, said he, I once got a flogging for not deciding correctly.


1.3.17
222
ἦν δὲ ἡ δίκη τοιαύτη .
The case was like this:


1.3.17
223
παῖς μέγας μικρὸν ἔχων χιτῶνα παῖδα μικρὸν μέγαν ἔχοντα χιτῶνα ἐκδύσας αὐτὸν τὸν μὲν ἑαυτοῦ ἐκεῖνον ἠμφίεσε , τὸν δ’ ἐκείνου αὐτὸς ἐνέδυ .
a big boy with a little tunic, finding a little boy with a big tunic on, took it off him and put his own tunic on him, while he himself put on the other’s.


1.3.17
224
ἐγὼ οὖν τούτοις δικάζων ἔγνων βέλτιον εἶναι ἀμφοτέροις τὸν ἁρμόττοντα ἑκάτερον χιτῶνα ἔχειν .
So, when I tried their case, I decided that it was better for them both that each should keep the tunic that fitted him.


1.3.17
225
ἐν τούτῳ δή με ἔπαισεν ὁ διδάσκαλος , λέξας ὅτι ὁπότε μὲν τοῦ ἁρμόττοντος εἴην κριτής , οὕτω δέοι ποιεῖν , ὁπότε δὲ κρῖναι δέοι ποτέρου ὁ χιτὼν εἴη , τοῦτ’ ἔφη σκεπτέον εἶναι τίς κτῆσις δικαία ἐστί , πότερα τὸ βίᾳ ἀφελόμενον ἔχειν ἢ τὸ ποιησάμενον ἢ πριάμενον κεκτῆσθαι ·
And thereupon the master flogged me, saying that when I was a judge of a good fit, I should do as I had done; but when it was my duty to decide whose tunic it was, I had this question, he said, to consider — whose title was the rightful one; whether it was right that he who took it away by force should keep it, or that he who had had it made for himself or had bought it should own it.


1.3.17
226
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἔφη τὸ μὲν νόμιμον δίκαιον εἶναι , τὸ δὲ ἄνομον βίαιον , σὺν τῷ νόμῳ ἐκέλευεν ἀεὶ τὸν δικαστὴν τὴν ψῆφον τίθεσθαι .
And since, he said, what is lawful is right and what is unlawful is wrong, he bade the judge always render his verdict on the side of the law.


1.3.17
227
οὕτως ἐγώ σοι , ὦ μῆτερ , τά γε δίκαια παντάπασιν ἤδη ἀκριβῶ ·
It is in this way, mother, you see, that I already have a thorough understanding of justice in all its bearings;


1.3.17
228
ἢν δέ τι ἄρα προσδέωμαι , ὁ πάππος με , ἔφη , οὗτος ἐπιδιδάξει .
and, he added, if I do require anything more, my grandfather here will teach me that.


1.3.18
229
ἀλλ’ οὐ τ- αὐτά , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , παρὰ τῷ πάππῳ καὶ ἐν Πέρσαις δίκαια ὁμολογεῖται .
Yes, my son, said she; but at your grandfather’s court they do not recognize the same principles of justice as they do in Persia.


1.3.18
230
οὗτος μὲν γὰρ τῶν ἐν Μήδοις πάντων ἑαυτὸν δεσπότην πεποίηκεν , ἐν Πέρσαις δὲ τὸ ἴσον ἔχειν δίκαιον νομίζεται .
For he has made himself master of everything in Media, but in Persia equality of rights is considered justice.


1.3.18
231
καὶ ὁ σὸς πρῶτος πατὴρ τὰ τεταγμένα μὲν ποιεῖ τῇ πόλει , τὰ τεταγμένα δὲ λαμβάνει , μέτρον δὲ αὐτῷ οὐχ ἡ ψυχὴ ἀλλ’ ὁ νόμος ἐστίν .
And your father is the first one to do what is ordered by the State and to accept what is decreed, and his standard is not his will but the law.


1.3.18
232
ὅπως οὖν μὴ ἀπολῇ μαστιγούμενος , ἐπειδὰν οἴκοι ᾖς , ἂν παρὰ τούτου μαθὼν ἥκῃς ἀντὶ τοῦ βασιλικοῦ τὸ τυραννικόν , ἐν ᾧ ἐστι τὸ πλέον οἴεσθαι χρῆναι πάντων ἔχειν .
Mind, therefore, that you be not flogged within an inch of your life, when you come home, if you return with a knowledge acquired from your grandfather here of the principles not of kingship but of tyranny, one principle of which is that it is right for one to have more than all.


1.3.18
233
ἀλλ’ ὅ γε σὸς πατήρ , εἶπεν ὁ Κῦρος , δεινότερός ἐστιν , ὦ μῆτερ , διδάσκειν μεῖον ἢ πλέον ἔχειν ·
But your father, at least, said Cyrus, is more shrewd at teaching people to have less than to have more, mother.


1.3.18
234
ἢ οὐχ ὁρᾷς , ἔφη , ὅτι καὶ Μήδους ἅπαντας δεδίδαχεν αὑτοῦ μεῖον ἔχειν ;
Why, do you not see, he went on, that he has taught all the Medes to have less than himself?


1.3.18
235
ὥστε θάρρει , ὡς ὅ γε σὸς πατὴρ οὔτ’ ἄλλον οὐδένα οὔτ’ ἐμὲ πλεονεκτεῖν μαθόντα ἀποπέμψει .
So never fear that your father, at any rate, will turn either me or anybody else out trained under him to have too much.


1.4.1
236
τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ πολλὰ ἐλάλει ὁ Κῦρος ·
In this way Cyrus often chattered on.


1.4.1
237
τέλος δὲ ἡ μὲν μήτηρ ἀπῆλθε , Κῦρος δὲ κατέμεινε καὶ αὐτοῦ ἐτρέφετο .
At last, however, his mother went away, but Cyrus remained behind and grew up in Media.


1.4.1
238
καὶ ταχὺ μὲν τοῖς ἡλικιώταις συνεκέκρατο ὥστε οἰκείως διακεῖσθαι , ταχὺ δὲ τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν ἀνήρτητο , προσιὼν καὶ ἔνδηλος ὢν ὅτι ἠσπάζετο αὐτῶν τοὺς υἱεῖς , ὥστε εἴ τι τοῦ βασιλέως δέοιντο , τοὺς παῖδας ἐκέλευον τοῦ Κύρου δεῖσθαι διαπράξασθαι σφίσιν , ὁ δὲ Κῦρος , ὅ τι δέοιντο αὐτοῦ οἱ παῖδες , διὰ τὴν φιλανθρωπίαν καὶ φιλοτιμίαν περὶ παντὸς ἐποιεῖτο διαπράττεσθαι , καὶ ὁ Ἀστυάγης δὲ ὅ τι δέοιτο αὐτοῦ ὁ Κῦρος οὐδὲν ἐδύνατο ἀντέχειν μὴ οὐ χαρίζεσθαι .
Soon he had become so intimately associated with other boys of his own years that he was on easy terms with them. And soon he had won their father’s hearts by visiting them and showing that he loved their sons, so that, if they desired any favour of the king, they bade their sons ask Cyrus to secure it for them. And Cyrus, because of his kindness of heart and his desire for popularity, made every effort to secure for the boys whatever they asked.


1.4.2
239
καὶ γὰρ ἀσθενήσαντος αὐτοῦ οὐδέποτε ἀπέλειπε τὸν πάππον οὐδὲ κλαίων ποτὲ ἐπαύετο , ἀλλὰ δῆλος ἦν πᾶσιν ὅτι ὑπερεφοβεῖτο μή οἱ ὁ πάππος ἀποθάνῃ ·
And Astyages could not refuse any favour that Cyrus asked of him.


1.4.2
240
καὶ γὰρ ἐκ νυκτὸς εἴ τινος δέοιτο Ἀστυάγης , πρῶτος ᾐσθάνετο Κῦρος καὶ πάντων ἀοκνότατα ἀνεπήδα ὑπηρετήσων ὅ τι οἴοιτο χαριεῖσθαι , ὥστε παντάπασιν ἀνεκτήσατο τὸν Ἀστυάγην .
And this was natural; for, when his grandfather fell sick, Cyrus never left him nor ceased to weep but plainly showed to all that he greatly feared that his grandfather might die. For even at night, if Astyages wanted anything, Cyrus was the first to discover it and with greater alacrity than anyone else he would jump up to perform whatever service he thought would give him pleasure, so that he won Astyages’s heart completely.


1.4.3
241
καὶ ἦν μὲν ἴσως πολυλογώτερος , ἅμα μὲν διὰ τὴν παιδείαν , ὅτι ἠναγκάζετο ὑπὸ τοῦ διδασκάλου καὶ διδόναι λόγον ὧν ἐποίει καὶ λαμβάνειν παρ’ ἄλλων , ὁπότε δικάζοι , ἔτι δὲ καὶ διὰ τὸ φιλομαθὴς εἶναι πολλὰ μὲν αὐτὸς ἀεὶ τοὺς παρόντας ἀνηρώτα πῶς ἔχοντα τυγχάνοι , καὶ ὅσα αὐτὸς ὑπ’ ἄλλων ἐρωτῷτο , διὰ τὸ ἀγχίνους εἶναι ταχὺ ἀπεκρίνετο , ὥστ’ ἐκ πάντων τούτων ἡ πολυλογία συνελέγετο αὐτῷ ·
He was, perhaps, too talkative, partly on account of his education, because he had always been required by his teacher to render an account of what he was doing and to obtain an account from others whenever he was judge; and partly also because of his natural curiosity, he was habitually putting many questions to those about him why things were thus and so; and because of his alertness of mind he readily answered questions that others put to him; so that from all these causes his talkativeness grew upon him.


1.4.3
242
ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐν σώματι , ὅσοι νέοι ὄντες μέγεθος ἔλαβον , ὅμως ἐμφαίνεται τὸ νεαρὸν αὐτοῖς ὃ κατηγορεῖ τὴν ὀλιγοετίαν , οὕτω καὶ Κύρου ἐκ τῆς πολυλογίας οὐ θράσος διεφαίνετο , ἀλλ’ ἁπλότης καὶ φιλοστοργία , ὥστ’ ἐπεθύμει ἄν τις ἔτι πλείω αὐτοῦ ἀκούειν ἢ σιωπῶντι παρεῖναι .
But it was not unpleasant; for just as in the body, in the case of those who have attained their growth although they are still young, there yet appears that freshness which betrays their lack of years, so also in Cyrus’s case his talkativeness disclosed not impertinence but naïveté and an affectionate disposition, so that one would be better pleased to hear still more from his lips than to sit by and have him keep silent.


1.4.4
243
ὡς δὲ προῆγεν αὐτὸν ὁ χρόνος σὺν τῷ μεγέθει εἰς ὥραν τοῦ πρόσηβον γενέσθαι , ἐν τούτῳ δὴ τοῖς μὲν λόγοις μανοτέροις ἐχρῆτο καὶ τῇ φωνῇ ἡσυχαιτέρᾳ , αἰδοῦς δ’ ἐνεπίμπλατο ὥστε καὶ ἐρυθραίνεσθαι ὁπότε συντυγχάνοι τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις , καὶ τὸ σκυλακῶδες τὸ πᾶσιν ὁμοίως προσπίπτειν οὐκέθ’ ὁμοίως προπετὲς εἶχεν .
But as he advanced in stature and in years to the time of attaining youth’s estate, he then came to use fewer words, his voice was more subdued, and he became so bashful that he actually blushed whenever he met his elders; and that puppy-like manner of breaking in upon anybody and everybody alike he no longer exhibited with so much forwardness.


1.4.4
244
οὕτω δὴ ἡσυχαίτερος μὲν ἦν , ἐν δὲ ταῖς συνουσίαις πάμπαν ἐπίχαρις .
So he became more quiet, to be sure, but in social intercourse altogether charming.


1.4.4
245
καὶ γὰρ ὅσα διαγωνίζονται πολλάκις ἥλικες πρὸς ἀλλήλους , οὐχ ἃ κρείττων ᾔδει ὤν , ταῦτα προυκαλεῖτο τοὺς συνόντας , ἀλλ’ ἅπερ εὖ ᾔδει ἑαυτὸν ἥττονα ὄντα , ἐξῆρχε , φάσκων κάλλιον αὐτῶν ποιήσειν , καὶ κατῆρχεν ἤδη ἀναπηδῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἢ διατοξευσόμενος ἢ διακοντιούμενος ἀπὸ τῶν ἵππων οὔπω πάνυ ἔποχος ὤν , ἡττώμενος δὲ αὐτὸς ἐφ’ ἑαυτῷ μάλιστα ἐγέλα .
The boys liked him, too; for in all the contests in which those of the same age are wont often to engage with one another he did not challenge his mates to those in which he knew he was superior, but he proposed precisely those exercises in which he knew he was not their equal, saying that he would do better than they; and he would at once take the lead, jumping up upon the horses to contend on horseback either in archery or in throwing the spear, although he was not yet a good rider, and when he was beaten he laughed at himself most heartily.


1.4.5
246
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἀπεδίδρασκεν ἐκ τοῦ ἡττᾶσθαι εἰς τὸ μὴ ποιεῖν ὃ ἡττῷτο , ἀλλ’ ἐκαλινδεῖτο ἐν τῷ πειρᾶσθαι αὖθις βέλτιον ποιεῖν , ταχὺ μὲν εἰς τὸ ἴσον ἀφίκετο τῇ ἱππικῇ τοῖς ἥλιξι , ταχὺ δὲ παρῄει διὰ τὸ ἐρᾶν τοῦ ἔργου , ταχὺ δὲ τὰ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ θηρία ἀνηλώκει διώκων καὶ βάλλων καὶ κατακαίνων , ὥστε ὁ Ἀστυάγης οὐκέτ’ εἶχεν αὐτῷ συλλέγειν θηρία .
And as he did not shirk being beaten and take refuge in refusing to do that in which he was beaten, but persevered in attempting to do better next time, he speedily became the equal of his fellows in horsemanship and soon on account of his love for the sport he surpassed them; and before long he had exhausted the supply of animals in the park by hunting and shooting and killing them, so that Astyages was no longer able to collect animals for him.


1.4.5
247
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος αἰσθόμενος ὅτι βουλόμενος οὐ δύναιτό οἱ ζῶντα πολλὰ παρέχειν , ἔλεγε πρὸς αὐτόν ·
And when Cyrus saw that notwithstanding his desire to do so, the king was unable to provide him with many animals alive, he said to him:


1.4.5
248
ὦ πάππε , τί σε δεῖ θηρία ζητοῦντα πράγματ’ ἔχειν ;
Why should you take the trouble, grandfather, to get animals for me?


1.4.5
249
ἀλλ’ ἐὰν ἐμὲ ἐκπέμπῃς ἐπὶ θήραν σὺν τῷ θείῳ , νομιῶ ὅσα ἂν ἴδω θηρία , ἐμοὶ ταῦτα τρέφεσθαι .
If you will only send me out with my uncle to hunt, I shall consider that all the animals I see were bred for me.


1.4.6
250
ἐπιθυμῶν δὲ σφόδρα ἐξιέναι ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν οὐκέτι ὁμοίως λιπαρεῖν ἐδύνατο ὥσπερ παῖς ὤν , ἀλλ’ ὀκνηρότερον προσῄει .
But though he was exceedingly eager to go out hunting, he could no longer coax for it as he used to do when he was a boy, but he became more diffident in his approaches.


1.4.6
251
καὶ ἃ πρόσθεν τῷ Σάκᾳ ἐμέμφετο ὅτι οὐ παρίει αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν πάππον , αὐτὸς ἤδη Σάκας ἑαυτῷ ἐγίγνετο ·
And in the very matter for which he found fault with Sacas before, namely that he would not admit him to his grandfather — he himself now became a Sacas unto himself;


1.4.6
252
οὐ γὰρ προσῄει , εἰ μὴ ἴδοι εἰ καιρὸς εἴη , καὶ τοῦ Σάκα ἐδεῖτο πάντως σημαίνειν αὐτῷ ὁπότε ἐγχωροίη καὶ ὁπότε καιρὸς εἴη ·
for he would not go in unless he saw that it was a proper time, and he asked Sacas by all means to let him know when it was convenient.


1.4.6
253
ὥστε ὁ Σάκας ὑπερεφίλει ἤδη καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι πάντες .
And so Sacas now came to love him dearly, as did all the rest.


1.4.7
254
ἐπεὶ δ’ οὖν ἔγνω ὁ Ἀστυάγης σφόδρα αὐτὸν ἐπιθυμοῦντα ἔξω θηρᾶν , ἐκπέμπει αὐτὸν σὺν τῷ θείῳ καὶ φύλακας συμπέμπει ἐφ’ ἵππων πρεσβυτέρους , ὅπως ἀπὸ τῶν δυσχωριῶν φυλάττοιεν αὐτὸν καὶ εἰ τῶν ἀγρίων τι φανείη θηρίων .
However, when Astyages realized that he was exceedingly eager to hunt out in the wilds, he let him go out with his uncle and he sent along some older men on horseback to look after him, to keep him away from dangerous places and guard him against wild beasts, in case any should appear.


1.4.7
255
ὁ οὖν Κῦρος τῶν ἑπομένων προθύμως ἐπυνθάνετο ποίοις οὐ χρὴ θηρίοις πελάζειν καὶ ποῖα χρὴ θαρροῦντα διώκειν .
Cyrus, therefore, eagerly inquired of those who attended him what animals one ought not to approach and what animals one might pursue without fear.


1.4.7
256
οἱ δ’ ἔλεγον ὅτι ἄρκτοι τε πολλοὺς ἤδη πλησιάσαντας διέφθειραν καὶ κάπροι καὶ λέοντες καὶ παρδάλεις , αἱ δὲ ἔλαφοι καὶ δορκάδες καὶ οἱ ἄγριοι οἶες καὶ οἱ ὄνοι οἱ ἄγριοι ἀσινεῖς εἰσιν .
And they told him that bears and boars and lions and leopards had killed many who came close to them, but that deer and gazelles and wild sheep and wild asses were harmless.


1.4.7
257
ἔλεγον δὲ καὶ τοῦτο , τὰς δυσχωρίας ὅτι δέοι φυλάττεσθαι οὐδὲν ἧττον ἢ τὰ θηρία ·
And they said this also, that one must be on one’s guard against dangerous places no less than against wild beasts;


1.4.7
258
πολλοὺς γὰρ ἤδη αὐτοῖς τοῖς ἵπποις κατακρημνισθῆναι .
for many riders had been thrown over precipices, horses and all.


1.4.8
259
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος πάντα ταῦτα ἐμάνθανε προθύμως ·
All these lessons Cyrus eagerly learned.


1.4.8
260
ὡς δὲ εἶδεν ἔλαφον ἐκπηδήσασαν , πάντων ἐπιλαθόμενος ὧν ἤκουσεν ἐδίωκεν οὐδὲν ἄλλο ὁρῶν ἢ ὅπῃ ἔφευγε .
But when he saw a deer spring out from under cover, he forgot everything that he had heard and gave chase, seeing nothing but the direction in which it was making.


1.4.8
261
καί πως διαπηδῶν αὐτῷ ὁ ἵππος πίπτει εἰς γόνατα , καὶ μικροῦ κ- ἐκεῖνον ἐξετραχήλισεν .
And somehow his horse in taking a leap fell upon its knees and almost threw him over its head.


1.4.8
262
οὐ μὴν ἀλλ’ ἐπέμεινεν ὁ Κῦρος μόλις πως , καὶ ὁ ἵππος ἐξανέστη .
However, Cyrus managed, with some difficulty, to keep his seat, and his horse got up.


1.4.8
263
ὡς δ’ εἰς τὸ πεδίον ἦλθεν , ἀκοντίσας καταβάλλει τὴν ἔλαφον , καλόν τι χρῆμα καὶ μέγα .
And when he came to level ground, he threw his spear and brought down the deer — a fine, large quarry.


1.4.8
264
καὶ ὁ μὲν δὴ ὑπερέχαιρεν ·
And he, of course, was greatly delighted;


1.4.8
265
οἱ δὲ φύλακες προσελάσαντες ἐλοιδόρουν αὐτὸν καὶ ἔλεγον εἰς οἷον κίνδυνον ἔλθοι , καὶ ἔφασαν κατερεῖν αὐτοῦ .
but the guards rode up and scolded him and told him into what danger he had gone and declared that they would tell of him.


1.4.8
266
ὁ οὖν Κῦρος εἱστήκει καταβεβηκώς , καὶ ἀκούων ταῦτα ἠνιᾶτο .
Now Cyrus stood there, for he had dismounted, and was vexed at being spoken to in this way.


1.4.8
267
ὡς δ’ ᾔσθετο κραυγῆς , ἀνεπήδησεν ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον ὥσπερ ἐνθουσιῶν , καὶ ὡς εἶδεν ἐκ τοῦ ἀντίου κάπρον προσφερόμενον , ἀντίος ἐλαύνει καὶ διατεινάμενος εὐστόχως βάλλει εἰς τὸ μέτωπον καὶ κατέσχε τὸν κάπρον .
But when he heard a halloo, he sprang upon his horse like one possessed and when he saw a boar rushing straight toward him, he rode to meet him and aiming well he struck the boar between the eyes and brought him down.


1.4.9
268
ἐνταῦθα μέντοι ἤδη καὶ ὁ θεῖος αὐτῷ ἐλοιδορεῖτο , τὴν θρασύτητα ὁρῶν .
This time, however, his uncle also reproved him, for he had witnessed his foolhardiness.


1.4.9
269
ὁ δ’ αὐτοῦ λοιδορουμένου ὅμως ἐδεῖτο ὅσα αὐτὸς ἔλαβε , ταῦτα ἐᾶσαι εἰσκομίσαντα δοῦναι τῷ πάππῳ .
But for all his scolding, Cyrus nevertheless asked his permission to carry home and present to his grandfather all the game that he had taken himself.


1.4.9
270
τὸν δὲ θεῖον εἰπεῖν φασιν ·
And his uncle, they say, replied:


1.4.9
271
ἀλλ’ ἢν αἴσθηται ὅτι ἐδίωκες , οὐ σοὶ μόνον λοιδορήσεται , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐμοί , ὅτι σε εἴων .
But if he finds out that you have been giving chase, he will chide not only you but me also for allowing you to do so.


1.4.9
272
καὶ ἢν βούληται , φάναι αὐτόν , μαστιγωσάτω , ἐπειδάν γε ἐγὼ δῶ αὐτῷ .
And if he choose, said Cyrus, let him flog me, provided only I may give him the game.


1.4.9
273
καὶ σύγε , ὅ τι βούλει , ἔφη , ὦ θεῖε , τιμωρησάμενος τοῦτο ὅμως χάρισαί μοι .
And you, uncle, said he, may punish me in any way you please — only grant me this favour.


1.4.9
274
καὶ ὁ Κυαξάρης μέντοι τελευτῶν εἶπε ·
And finally Cyaxares said, though with reluctance:


1.4.9
275
ποίει ὅπως βούλει ·
Do as you wish;


1.4.9
276
σὺ γὰρ νῦν γε ἡμῶν ἔοικας βασιλεὺς εἶναι .
for now it looks as if it were you who are our king.


1.4.10
277
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κῦρος εἰσκομίσας τὰ θηρία ἐδίδου τε τῷ πάππῳ καὶ ἔλεγεν ὅτι αὐτὸς ταῦτα θηράσειεν ἐκείνῳ .
So Cyrus carried the animals in and gave them to his grandfather, saying that he had himself taken this game for him.


1.4.10
278
καὶ τὰ ἀκόντια ἐπεδείκνυ μὲν οὔ , κατέθηκε δὲ ᾑματωμένα ὅπου ᾤετο τὸν πάππον ὄψεσθαι .
As for the hunting spears, though he did not show them to him, he laid them down all blood-stained where he thought his grandfather would see them.


1.4.10
279
ὁ δὲ Ἀστυάγης ἄρα εἶπεν ·
And then Astyages said:


1.4.10
280
ἀλλ’ , ὦ παῖ , δέχομαι μὲν ἔγωγε ἡδέως ὅσα σὺ δίδως , οὐ μέντοι δέομαί γε τούτων οὐδενός , ὥστε σε κινδυνεύειν .
Well, my boy, I am glad to accept what you offer me; however, I do not need any of these things enough for you to risk your life for them.


1.4.10
281
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἔφη ·
Well then, grandfather, said Cyrus,


1.4.10
282
εἰ τοίνυν μὴ σὺ δέῃ , ἱκετεύω , ὦ πάππε , ἐμοὶ δὸς αὐτά , ὅπως τοῖς ἡλικιώταις ἐγὼ διαδῶ .
if you do not need them, please give them to me, that I may divide them among my boy friends.


1.4.10
283
ἀλλ’ , ὦ παῖ , ἔφη ὁ Ἀστυάγης , καὶ ταῦτα λαβὼν διαδίδου ὅτῳ σὺ βούλει καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὁπόσα θέλεις .
All right, my boy, said Astyages, take both this and of the rest of the game as much as you wish and give it to whom you will.


1.4.11
284
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν ἐδίδου τε ἄρας τοῖς παισὶ καὶ ἅμα ἔλεγεν ·
So Cyrus took the animals and gave them to the boys, saying as he did so:


1.4.11
285
ὦ παῖδες , ὡς ἄρα ἐφλυαροῦμεν ὅτε τὰ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ θηρία ἐθηρῶμεν ·
What tomfoolery it was, fellows, when we used to hunt the animals in the park.


1.4.11
286
ὅμοιον ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ εἶναι οἷόνπερ εἴ τις δεδεμένα ζῷα θηρῴη .
To me at least, it seems just like hunting animals that were tied up.


1.4.11
287
πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ ἐν μικρῷ χωρίῳ ἦν , ἔπειτα λεπτὰ καὶ ψωραλέα , καὶ τὸ μὲν αὐτῶν χωλὸν ἦν , τὸ δὲ κολοβόν ·
For, in the first place, they were in a small space; besides, they were lean and mangy; and one of them was lame and another maimed.


1.4.11
288
τὰ δ’ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι καὶ λειμῶσι θηρία ὡς μὲν καλά , ὡς δὲ μεγάλα , ὡς δὲ λιπαρὰ ἐφαίνετο .
But the animals out on the mountains and the plains — how fine they looked, and large and sleek!


1.4.11
289
καὶ αἱ μὲν ἔλαφοι ὥσπερ πτηναὶ ἥλλοντο πρὸς τὸν οὐρανόν , οἱ δὲ κάπροι ὥσπερ τοὺς ἄνδρας φασὶ τοὺς ἀνδρείους ὁμόσε ἐφέροντο ·
And the deer leaped up skyward as if on wings, and the boars came charging at once, as they say brave men do in battle.


1.4.11
290
ὑπὸ δὲ τῆς πλατύτητος οὐδὲ ἁμαρτεῖν οἷόν τ’ ἦν αὐτῶν ·
And by reason of their bulk it was quite impossible to miss them.


1.4.11
291
καλλίω δή , ἔφη , ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ καὶ τεθνηκότα εἶναι ταῦτα ἢ ζῶντα ἐκεῖνα τὰ περιῳκοδομημένα .
And to me at least, said he, these seem really more beautiful, when dead, than those pent up creatures, when alive.


1.4.11
292
ἀλλ’ ἆρα ἄν , ἔφη , ἀφεῖεν καὶ ὑμᾶς οἱ πατέρες ἐπὶ θήραν ;
But say, said he, would not your fathers let you go out hunting, too?


1.4.11
293
καὶ ῥᾳδίως γ’ ἄν , ἔφασαν , εἰ Ἀστυάγης κελεύοι .
Aye, and readily, they said, if Astyages should give the word.


1.4.12
294
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε ·
And Cyrus said:


1.4.12
295
τίς οὖν ἂν ἡμῖν Ἀστυάγει μνησθείη ;
Whom, then, could we find to speak about it to Astyages?


1.4.12
296
τίς γὰρ ἄν , ἔφασαν , σοῦ γε ἱκανώτερος πεῖσαι ;
Why, said they, who would be better able to gain his consent than you yourself?


1.4.12
297
ἀλλὰ μὰ τὸν Δία , ἔφη , ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅστις ἄνθρωπος γεγένημαι ·
No, by Zeus, said he, not I; I do not know what sort of fellow I have become;


1.4.12
298
οὐδὲ γὰρ οἷός τ’ εἰμὶ λέγειν ἔγωγε οὐδ’ ἀναβλέπειν πρὸς τὸν πάππον ἐκ τοῦ ἴσου ἔτι δύναμαι .
for I cannot speak to my grandfather or even look up at him any more, as I used to do.


1.4.12
299
ἢν δὲ τοσοῦτον ἐπιδιδῶ , δέδοικα , ἔφη , μὴ παντάπασι βλάξ τις καὶ ἠλίθιος γένωμαι ·
And if I keep on at this rate, said he, I fear I shall become a mere dolt and ninny.


1.4.12
300
παιδάριον δ’ ὢν δεινότατος λαλεῖν ἐδόκουν εἶναι .
But when I was a little fellow, I was thought ready enough to chatter.


1.4.12
301
καὶ οἱ παῖδες εἶπον ·
That’s bad news you’re giving us, answered the boys,


1.4.12
302
πονηρὸν λέγεις τὸ πρᾶγμα , εἰ μηδ’ ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἄν τι δέῃ δυνήσῃ πράττειν , ἀλλ’ ἄλλου τινὸς τὸ ἐπὶ σὲ ἀνάγκη ἔσται δεῖσθαι ἡμᾶς .
if you are not going to be able to act for us in case of need, and we shall have to ask somebody else to do your part.


1.4.13
303
ἀκούσας δὲ ταῦτα ὁ Κῦρος ἐδήχθη , καὶ σιγῇ ἀπελθὼν διακελευσάμενος ἑαυτῷ τολμᾶν εἰσῆλθεν , ἐπιβουλεύσας ὅπως ἂν ἀλυπότατα εἴποι πρὸς τὸν πάππον καὶ διαπράξειεν αὑτῷ τε καὶ τοῖς παισὶν ὧν ἐδέοντο .
And Cyrus, nettled at hearing this, went away without a word; and when he had summoned up his courage to make the venture, he went in, after he had laid his plans how he might with the least annoyance broach the subject to his grandfather and accomplish for himself and the other boys what they desired.


1.4.13
304
ἤρξατο οὖν ὧδε .
Accordingly, he began as follows:


1.4.13
305
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ πάππε , ἤν τις ἀποδρᾷ σε τῶν οἰκετῶν καὶ λάβῃς αὐτόν , τί αὐτῷ χρήσῃ ;
Tell me, grandfather, said he, if one of your servants runs away and you catch him again, what will you do to him?


1.4.13
306
τί ἄλλο , ἔφη , ἢ δήσας ἐργάζεσθαι ἀναγκάσω ;
What else, said he, but put him in chains and make him work?


1.4.13
307
ἢν δὲ αὐτόματος πάλιν ἔλθῃ , πῶς ποιήσεις ;
But if he comes back again of his own accord, what will you do?


1.4.13
308
τί δέ , ἔφη , εἰ μὴ μαστιγώσας γε , ἵνα μὴ αὖθις τοῦτο ποιῇ , ἐξ ἀρχῆς χρήσομαι ;
What, said he, but flog him to prevent his doing it again, and then treat him as before?


1.4.13
309
ὥρα ἄν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , σοὶ παρασκευάζεσθαι εἴη ὅτῳ μαστιγώσεις με , ὡς βουλεύομαί γε ὅπως σε ἀποδρῶ λαβὼν τοὺς ἡλικιώτας ἐπὶ θήραν .
It may be high time, then, said Cyrus, for you to be making ready to flog me; for I am planning to run away from you and take my comrades out hunting.


1.4.13
310
καὶ ὁ Ἀστυάγης , καλῶς , ἔφη , ἐποίησας προειπών ·
 Astyages said.


1.4.13
311
ἔνδοθεν γάρ , ἔφη , ἀπαγορεύω σοι μὴ κινεῖσθαι .
You have done well to tell me in advance, for now, he went on, I forbid you to stir from the palace.


1.4.13
312
χαρίεν γάρ , ἔφη , εἰ ἕνεκα κρεαδίων τῇ θυγατρὶ τὸν παῖδα ἀποβουκολήσαιμι .
For it would be a nice thing, if, for the sake of a few morsels of meat, I should play the careless herdsman and lose my daughter her son.


1.4.14
313
ἀκούσας ταῦτα ὁ Κῦρος ἐπείθετο μὲν καὶ ἔμεινεν , ἀνιαρὸς δὲ καὶ σκυθρωπὸς ὢν σιωπῇ διῆγεν .
When Cyrus heard this, he obeyed and stayed at home; he said nothing, but continued downcast and sulky.


1.4.14
314
ὁ μέντοι Ἀστυάγης ἐπεὶ ἔγνω αὐτὸν λυπούμενον ἰσχυρῶς , βουλόμενος αὐτῷ χαρίζεσθαι ἐξάγει ἐπὶ θήραν , καὶ πεζοὺς πολλοὺς καὶ ἱππέας συναλίσας καὶ τοὺς παῖδας καὶ συνελάσας εἰς τὰ ἱππάσιμα χωρία τὰ θηρία ἐποίησε μεγάλην θήραν .
However, when Astyages saw that he was exceedingly disappointed, wishing to give him pleasure, he took him out to hunt; he had got the boys together, and a large number of men both on foot and on horseback, and when he had driven the wild animals out into country where riding was practicable, he instituted a great hunt.


1.4.14
315
καὶ βασιλικῶς δὴ παρὼν αὐτὸς ἀπηγόρευε μηδένα βάλλειν , πρὶν Κῦρος ἐμπλησθείη θηρῶν .
And as he was present himself, he gave the royal command that no one should throw a spear before Cyrus had his fill of hunting.


1.4.14
316
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος οὐκ εἴα κωλύειν , ἀλλ’ , εἰ βούλει , ἔφη , ὦ πάππε , ἡδέως με θηρᾶν , ἄφες τοὺς κατ’ ἐμὲ πάντας διώκειν καὶ διαγωνίζεσθαι ὅπως ἂν ἕκαστος κράτιστα δύναιτο .
But Cyrus would not permit him to interfere, but said: If you wish me to enjoy the hunt, grandfather, let all my comrades give chase and strive to outdo one another, and each do his very best.


1.4.15
317
ἐνταῦθα δὴ ὁ Ἀστυάγης ἀφίησι , καὶ στὰς ἐθεᾶτο ἁμιλλωμένους ἐπὶ τὰ θηρία καὶ φιλονικοῦντας καὶ διώκοντας καὶ ἀκοντίζοντας .
Thereupon, Astyages gave his consent and from his position he watched them rushing in rivalry upon the beasts and vying eagerly with one another in giving chase and in throwing the spear.


1.4.15
318
καὶ Κύρῳ ἥδετο οὐ δυναμένῳ σιγᾶν ὑπὸ τῆς ἡδονῆς , ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ σκύλακι γενναίῳ ἀνακλάζοντι , ὁπότε πλησιάζοι θηρίῳ , καὶ παρακαλοῦντι ὀνομαστὶ ἕκαστον .
And he was pleased to see that Cyrus was unable to keep silence for delight, but, like a well-bred hound, gave tongue whenever he came near an animal and urged on each of his companions by name.


1.4.15
319
καὶ τοῦ μὲν καταγελῶντα αὐτὸν ὁρῶν ηὐφραίνετο , τὸν δέ τινα καὶ ἐπαινοῦντα αὐτὸν ᾐσθάνετο οὐδ’ ὁπωστιοῦν φθονερῶς .
And the king was delighted to see him laugh at one and praise another without the least bit of jealousy.


1.4.15
320
τέλος δ’ οὖν πολλὰ θηρία ἔχων ὁ Ἀστυάγης ἀπῄει .
At length, then, Astyages went home with a large amount of game;


1.4.15
321
καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν οὕτως ἥσθη τῇ τότε θήρᾳ ὥστε ἀεὶ ὁπότε οἷόν τ’ εἴη συνεξῄει τῷ Κύρῳ καὶ ἄλλους τε πολλοὺς παρελάμβανε καὶ τοὺς παῖδας , Κύρου ἕνεκα .
and he was so pleased with that chase, that thenceforth he always went out with Cyrus when it was possible, and he took along with him not only many others but, for Cyrus’s sake, the boys as well.


1.4.15
322
τὸν μὲν δὴ πλεῖστον χρόνον οὕτω διῆγεν ὁ Κῦρος , πᾶσιν ἡδονῆς μὲν καὶ ἀγαθοῦ τινος συναίτιος ὤν , κακοῦ δὲ οὐδενός .
Thus Cyrus passed most of his time, contriving some pleasure and good for all, but responsible for nothing unpleasant to any one.


1.4.16
323
ἀμφὶ δὲ τὰ πέντε ἢ ἑκκαίδεκα ἔτη γενομένου αὐτοῦ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀσσυρίων βασιλέως γαμεῖν μέλλων ἐπεθύμησε καὶ αὐτὸς θηρᾶσαι ἐς τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον .
But when Cyrus was about fifteen or sixteen years old, the son of the Assyrian king, on the eve of his marriage, desired in person to get the game for that occasion.


1.4.16
324
ἀκούων οὖν ἐν τοῖς μεθορίοις τοῖς τε αὑτῶν καὶ τοῖς Μήδων πολλὰ θηρία εἶναι ἀθήρευτα διὰ τὸν πόλεμον , ἐνταῦθα ἐπεθύμησεν ἐξελθεῖν .
Now, hearing that on the frontiers of Assyria and Media there was plenty of game that because of the war had not been hunted, he desired to go out thither.


1.4.16
325
ὅπως οὖν ἀσφαλῶς θηρῴη , ἱππέας τε προσέλαβε πολλοὺς καὶ πελταστάς , οἵτινες ἔμελλον αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν λασίων τὰ θηρία ἐξελᾶν ἐς τὰ ἐργάσιμά τε καὶ εὐήλατα .
Accordingly, that he might hunt without danger, he took along a large force of cavalry and targeteers, who were to drive the game out of the thickets for him into country that was open and suitable for riding.


1.4.16
326
ἀφικόμενος δὲ ὅπου ἦν αὐτοῖς τὰ φρούρια καὶ ἡ φυλακή , ἐνταῦθα ἐδειπνοποιεῖτο , ὡς πρῲ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ θηράσων .
And when he arrived where their frontier-forts and the garrison were, there he dined, planning to hunt early on the following day.


1.4.17
327
ἤδη δὲ ἑσπέρας γενομένης ἡ διαδοχὴ τῇ πρόσθεν φυλακῇ ἔρχεται ἐκ πόλεως καὶ ἱππεῖς καὶ πεζοί .
And now when evening had come, the relief-corps for the former garrison came from the city, both horse and foot.


1.4.17
328
ἔδοξεν οὖν αὐτῷ πολλὴ στρατιὰ παρεῖναι ·
He thought, therefore, that he had a large army at hand;


1.4.17
329
δύο γὰρ ὁμοῦ ἦσαν φυλακαί , πολλούς τε αὐτὸς ἧκεν ἔχων ἱππέας καὶ πεζούς .
for the two garrisons were there together and he himself had come with a large force of cavalry and infantry.


1.4.17
330
ἐβουλεύσατο οὖν κράτιστον εἶναι λεηλατῆσαι ἐκ τῆς Μηδικῆς , καὶ λαμπρότερόν τ’ ἂν φανῆναι τὸ ἔργον τῆς θήρας καὶ ἱερείων ἂν πολλὴν ἀφθονίαν ἐνόμιζε γενέσθαι .
Accordingly, he decided that it was best to make a foray into the Median territory and he thought that thus the exploit of the hunt would appear more brilliant and that the number of animals captured would be immense.


1.4.17
331
οὕτω δὴ πρῲ ἀναστὰς ἦγε τὸ στράτευμα , καὶ τοὺς μὲν πεζοὺς κατέλιπεν ἁθρόους ἐν τοῖς μεθορίοις , αὐτὸς δὲ τοῖς ἵπποις προσελάσας πρὸς τὰ τῶν Μήδων φρούρια , τοὺς μὲν βελτίστους καὶ πλείστους ἔχων μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ ἐνταῦθα κατέμεινεν , ὡς μὴ βοηθοῖεν οἱ φρουροὶ τῶν Μήδων ἐπὶ τοὺς καταθέοντας , τοὺς δ’ ἐπιτηδείους ἀφῆκε κατὰ φυλὰς ἄλλους ἄλλοσε καταθεῖν , καὶ ἐκέλευε περιβαλλομένους ὅτῳ τις ἐπιτυγχάνοι ἐλαύνειν πρὸς ἑαυτόν .
And so, rising early, he led his army out; the infantry he left together at the frontier, while he himself, riding up with the horse to the outposts of the Medes, took his stand there with most of his bravest men about him, to prevent the Median guards from coming to the rescue against those who were scouring the country; and he sent out the proper men in divisions, some in one direction, some in another, to scour the country, with orders to capture whatever they came upon and bring it to him.


1.4.17
332
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἔπραττον .
So they were engaged in these operations.


1.4.18
333
σημανθέντων δὲ τῷ Ἀστυάγει ὅτι πολέμιοί εἰσιν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ , ἐξεβοήθει καὶ αὐτὸς πρὸς τὰ ὅρια σὺν τοῖς περὶ αὐτὸν καὶ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ὡσαύτως σὺν τοῖς παρατυχοῦσιν ἱππόταις , καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις δὲ ἐσήμαινε πᾶσιν ἐκβοηθεῖν .
But when word was brought to Astyages that there were enemies in the country, he himself sallied forth to the frontier in person with his body-guard, and likewise his son with the knights that happened to be at hand marched out, while he gave directions to all the others also to come out to his assistance.


1.4.18
334
ὡς δὲ εἶδον πολλοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῶν Ἀσσυρίων συντεταγμένους καὶ τοὺς ἱππέας ἡσυχίαν ἔχοντας , ἔστησαν καὶ οἱ Μῆδοι .
But when they saw a large number of Assyrian troops drawn up and their cavalry standing still, the Medes also came to a halt.


1.4.18
335
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὁρῶν ἐκβοηθοῦντας καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους πασσυδί , ἐκβοηθεῖ καὶ αὐτὸς πρῶτον τότε ὅπλα ἐνδύς , οὔποτε οἰόμενος ·
When Cyrus saw the rest marching out with all speed, he put on his armour then for the first time and started out, too; this was an opportunity that he had thought would never come—


1.4.18
336
οὕτως ἐπεθύμει αὐτοῖς ἐξοπλίσασθαι ·
so eager was he to don his arms;


1.4.18
337
μάλα δὲ καλὰ ἦν καὶ ἁρμόττοντα αὐτῷ ἃ ὁ πάππος περὶ τὸ σῶμα ἐπεποίητο .
and the armour that his grandfather had had made to order for him was very beautiful and fitted him well.


1.4.18
338
οὕτω δὴ ἐξοπλισάμενος προσήλασε τῷ ἵππῳ .
Thus equipped he rode up on his horse.


1.4.18
339
καὶ ὁ Ἀστυάγης ἐθαύμασε μὲν τίνος κελεύσαντος ἥκοι , ὅμως δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ μένειν παρ’ ἑαυτόν .
And though Astyages wondered at whose order he had come, he nevertheless told the lad to come and stay by his side.


1.4.19
340
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὡς εἶδε πολλοὺς ἱππέας ἀντίους , ἤρετο ·
And when Cyrus saw many horsemen over against them, he asked:


1.4.19
341
ἦ οὗτοι , ἔφη , ὦ πάππε , πολέμιοί εἰσιν , οἳ ἐφεστήκασι τοῖς ἵπποις ἠρέμα ;
Say, grandfather, said he, are those men enemies who sit there quietly upon their horses?


1.4.19
342
πολέμιοι μέντοι , ἔφη .
Yes, indeed, they are, said he.


1.4.19
343
ἦ καὶ ἐκεῖνοι , ἔφη , οἱ ἐλαύνοντες ;
Are those enemies, too, said Cyrus, who are riding up and down?


1.4.19
344
κ- ἐκεῖνοι μέντοι .
Yes, they are enemies, too.


1.4.19
345
νὴ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφη , ὦ πάππε , ἀλλ’ οὖν πονηροί γε φαινόμενοι καὶ ἐπὶ πονηρῶν ἱππαρίων ἄγουσιν ἡμῶν τὰ χρήματα ·
Well then, by Zeus, grandfather, said he, at any rate, they are a sorry looking lot on a sorry lot of nags who are raiding our belongings.


1.4.19
346
οὐκοῦν χρὴ ἐλαύνειν τινὰς ἡμῶν ἐπ’ αὐτούς .
Why, some of us ought to charge upon them.


1.4.19
347
ἀλλ’ οὐχ ὁρᾷς , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , ὅσον τὸ στῖφος τῶν ἱππέων ἕστηκε συντεταγμένον ;
But don’t you see, my son, said the king, what a dense array of cavalry is standing there in line?


1.4.19
348
οἳ ἢν ἐπ’ ἐκείνους ἡμεῖς ἐλαύνωμεν , ὑποτεμοῦνται ἡμᾶς πάλιν ἐκεῖνοι ·
If we charge upon those over there, these in turn will cut us off;


1.4.19
349
ἡμῖν δὲ οὔπω ἡ ἰσχὺς πάρεστιν .
while as for us, the main body of our forces has not yet come.


1.4.19
350
ἀλλ’ ἢν σὺ μένῃς , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καὶ ἀναλαμβάνῃς τοὺς προσβοηθοῦντας , φοβήσονται οὗτοι καὶ οὐ κινήσονται , οἱ δ’ ἄγοντες εὐθὺς ἀφήσουσι τὴν λείαν , ἐπειδὰν ἴδωσί τινας ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἐλαύνοντας .
But if you stay here, said Cyrus, and take up the reinforcements that are coming to join us, these fellows will be afraid and will not stir, while the raiders will drop their booty, just as soon as they see some of us charging on them.


1.4.20
351
ταῦτ’ εἰπόντος αὐτοῦ ἔδοξέ τι λέγειν τῷ Ἀστυάγει .
It seemed to Astyages that there was something in Cyrus’s suggestion, when he said this.


1.4.20
352
καὶ ἅμα θαυμάζων ὡς καὶ ἐφρόνει καὶ ἐγρηγόρει κελεύει τὸν υἱὸν λαβόντα τάξιν ἱππέων ἐλαύνειν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄγοντας τὴν λείαν .
And while he wondered that the boy was so shrewd and wide-awake, he ordered his son to take a division of the cavalry and charge upon those who were carrying off the spoil.


1.4.20
353
ἐγὼ δέ , ἔφη , ἐπὶ τούσδε , ἢν ἐπὶ σὲ κινῶνται , ἐλῶ , ὥστε ἀναγκασθήσονται ἡμῖν προσέχειν τὸν νοῦν .
And if, said he, these others make a move against you, I will charge upon them, so that they will be forced to turn their attention to us.


1.4.20
354
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κυαξάρης λαβὼν τῶν ἐρρωμένων ἵππων τε καὶ ἀνδρῶν προσελαύνει .
So then Cyaxares took some of the most powerful horses and men and advanced.


1.4.20
355
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ὡς εἶδεν ὁρμωμένους , ἐξορμᾷ , καὶ αὐτὸς πρῶτος ἡγεῖτο ταχέως , καὶ ὁ Κυαξάρης μέντοι ἐφείπετο , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι δὲ οὐκ ἀπελείποντο .
And when Cyrus saw them starting, he rushed off and soon took the lead, while Cyaxares followed after, and the rest also were not left behind.


1.4.20
356
ὡς δὲ εἶδον αὐτοὺς πελάζοντας οἱ λεηλατοῦντες , εὐθὺς ἀφέντες τὰ χρήματα ἔφευγον .
And when the foragers saw them approaching, they straightway let go their booty and took to flight.


1.4.21
357
οἱ δ’ ἀμφὶ τὸν Κῦρον ὑπετέμνοντο , καὶ οὓς μὲν κατελάμβανον εὐθὺς ἔπαιον , πρῶτος δὲ ὁ Κῦρος , ὅσοι δὲ παραλλάξαντες αὐτῶν ἔφθασαν , κατόπιν τούτους ἐδίωκον , καὶ οὐκ ἀνίεσαν , ἀλλ’ ᾕρουν τινὰς αὐτῶν .
But Cyrus and his followers tried to cut them off, and those whom they caught they at once struck down, Cyrus taking the lead; and they pursued hard after those who succeeded in getting past, and they did not give up but took some of them prisoners.


1.4.21
358
ὥσπερ δὲ κύων γενναῖος ἄπειρος ἀπρονοήτως φέρεται πρὸς κάπρον , οὕτω καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἐφέρετο , μόνον ὁρῶν τὸ παίειν τὸν ἁλισκόμενον , ἄλλο δ’ οὐδὲν προνοῶν .
As a well-bred but untrained hound rushes recklessly upon a boar, so Cyrus rushed on, with regard for nothing but to strike down every one he overtook and reckless of anything else.


1.4.21
359
οἱ δὲ πολέμιοι ὡς ἑώρων πονοῦντας τοὺς σφετέρους , προυκίνησαν τὸ στῖφος , ὡς παυσομένους τοῦ διωγμοῦ , ἐπεὶ σφᾶς ἴδοιεν προορμήσαντας .
The enemy, however, when they saw their comrades hard pressed, advanced their column in the hope that the Medes would give up the pursuit on seeing them push forward.


1.4.22
360
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἀνίει , ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ τῆς χαρμονῆς ἀνακαλῶν τὸν θεῖον ἐδίωκε καὶ ἰσχυρὰν τὴν φυγὴν τοῖς πολεμίοις κατέχων ἐποίει , καὶ ὁ Κυαξάρης μέντοι ἐφείπετο , ἴσως καὶ αἰσχυνόμενος τὸν πατέρα , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι δὲ εἵποντο , προθυμότεροι ὄντες ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ εἰς τὸ διώκειν καὶ οἱ μὴ πάνυ πρὸς τοὺς ἐναντίους ἄλκιμοι ὄντες .
But none the more did Cyrus give over, but in his battle-joy he called to his uncle and continued the pursuit; and pressing on he put the enemy to headlong flight, and Cyaxares did not fail to follow, partly perhaps not to be shamed before his father; and the rest likewise followed, for under such circumstances they were more eager for the pursuit, even those who were not so very brave in the face of the enemy.


1.4.22
361
ὁ δὲ Ἀστυάγης ὡς ἑώρα τοὺς μὲν ἀπρονοήτως διώκοντας , τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους ἁθρόους τε καὶ τεταγμένους ὑπαντῶντας , δείσας περί τε τοῦ υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ Κύρου μὴ εἰς παρεσκευασμένους ἀτάκτως ἐμπεσόντες πάθοιέν τι , ἡγεῖτο εὐθὺς πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους .
But when Astyages saw them pursuing recklessly and the enemy advancing in good order to meet them, he was afraid that something might happen to his son and Cyrus, if they fell in disorder upon the enemy in readiness for battle, and straightway he advanced upon the foe.


1.4.23
362
οἱ δ’ αὖ πολέμιοι ὡς εἶδον τοὺς Μήδους προκινηθέντας , διατεινάμενοι οἱ μὲν τὰ παλτὰ οἱ δὲ τὰ τόξα εἱστήκεσαν , ὡς δή , ἐπειδὴ εἰς τόξευμα ἀφίκοιντο , στησομένους , ὥσπερ τὰ πλεῖστα εἰώθεσαν ποιεῖν .
Now the enemy on their part, when they saw the Medes advance, halted, some with spears poised, others with bows drawn, expecting that the other side would also halt, as soon as they came within bow-shot, just as they were accustomed generally to do;


1.4.23
363
μέχρι γὰρ τοσούτου , ὁπότε ἐγγύτατα γένοιντο , προσήλαυνον ἀλλήλοις καὶ ἠκροβολίζοντο πολλάκις μέχρι ἑσπέρας .
for it was their habit to advance only so far against each other, when they came into closest quarters, and to skirmish with missiles, oftentimes till evening.


1.4.23
364
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἑώρων τοὺς μὲν σφετέρους φυγῇ εἰς ἑαυτοὺς φερομένους , τοὺς δ’ ἀμφὶ τὸν Κῦρον ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ὁμοῦ ἀγομένους , τὸν δὲ Ἀστυάγην σὺν τοῖς ἵπποις ἐντὸς γιγνόμενον ἤδη τοξεύματος , ἐκκλίνουσι καὶ φεύγουσιν ὁμόθεν διώκοντας ἀνὰ κράτος ·
But when they saw their comrades rushing in flight toward them, and Cyrus and his followers bearing down close upon them, and Astyages with his cavalry getting already within bow-shot, they broke and fled with all their might from the Medes who followed hard after them.


1.4.23
365
ᾕρουν δὲ πολλούς ·
The Medes caught up with many of them;


1.4.23
366
καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἁλισκομένους ἔπαιον καὶ ἵππους καὶ ἄνδρας , τοὺς δὲ πίπτοντας κατέκαινον ·
and those whom they overtook they smote, both men and horses; and the fallen they slew.


1.4.23
367
καὶ οὐ πρόσθεν ἔστησαν πρὶν ἢ πρὸς τοῖς πεζοῖς τῶν Ἀσσυρίων ἐγένοντο .
Nor did they stop, until they came up with the Assyrian infantry.


1.4.23
368
ἐνταῦθα μέντοι δείσαντες μὴ καὶ ἐνέδρα τις μείζων ὑπείη , ἐπέσχον .
Then, however, fearing lest some greater force might be lying in ambush, they came to a halt.


1.4.24
369
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ἀνῆγεν ὁ Ἀστυάγης , μάλα χαίρων καὶ τῇ ἱπποκρατίᾳ , καὶ τὸν Κῦρον οὐκ ἔχων ὅ τι χρὴ λέγειν , αἴτιον μὲν ὄντα εἰδὼς τοῦ ἔργου , μαινόμενον δὲ γιγνώσκων τῇ τόλμῃ .
Then Astyages marched back, greatly rejoicing over the victory of his cavalry but not knowing what to say of Cyrus;


1.4.24
370
καὶ γὰρ τότε ἀπιόντων οἴκαδε μόνος τῶν ἄλλων ἐκεῖνος οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἢ τοὺς πεπτωκότας περιελαύνων ἐθεᾶτο , καὶ μόλις αὐτὸν ἀφελκύσαντες οἱ ἐπὶ τοῦτο ταχθέντες προσήγαγον τῷ Ἀστυάγει , μάλα ἐπίπροσθεν ποιούμενον τοὺς προσάγοντας , ὅτι ἑώρα τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πάππου ἠγριωμένον ἐπὶ τῇ θέᾳ τῇ αὑτοῦ .
for though he realized that his grandson was responsible for the outcome, yet he recognized also that he was frenzied with daring. And of this there was further evidence; for, as the rest made their way homeward, he did nothing but ride around alone and gloat upon the slain, and only with difficulty did those who were detailed to do so succeed in dragging him away and taking him to Astyages; and as he came, he set his escort well before him, for he saw that his grandfather’s face was angry because of his gloating upon them.


1.4.25
371
ἐν μὲν δὴ Μήδοις ταῦτα ἐγεγένητο , καὶ οἵ τε ἄλλοι πάντες τὸν Κῦρον διὰ στόματος εἶχον καὶ ἐν λόγῳ καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς , ὅ τε Ἀστυάγης καὶ πρόσθεν τιμῶν αὐτὸν τότε ὑπερεξεπέπληκτο ἐπ’ αὐτῷ .
Such was his life in Media; and Cyrus was not only on the tongues of all the rest both in story and in song, but Astyages also, while he had esteemed him before, was now highly delighted with him.


1.4.25
372
Καμβύσης δὲ ὁ τοῦ Κύρου πατὴρ ἥδετο μὲν πυνθανόμενος ταῦτα , ἐπεὶ δ’ ἤκουσεν ἔργα ἀνδρὸς ἤδη διαχειριζόμενον τὸν Κῦρον , ἀπεκάλει δή , ὅπως τὰ ἐν Πέρσαις ἐπιχώρια ἐπιτελοίη .
And Cambyses, Cyrus’s father, was pleased to learn this. But when he heard that Cyrus was already performing a man’s deeds, he summoned him home to complete the regular curriculum in Persia.


1.4.25
373
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος δὲ ἐνταῦθα λέγεται εἰπεῖν ὅτι ἀπιέναι βούλοιτο , μὴ ὁ πατήρ τι ἄχθοιτο καὶ ἡ πόλις μέμφοιτο .
And Cyrus also, we are told, said then that he wished to go home, in order that his father might not feel any displeasure nor the state be disposed to criticise;


1.4.25
374
καὶ τῷ Ἀστυάγει δὲ ἐδόκει εἶναι ἀναγκαῖον ἀποπέμπειν αὐτόν .
and Astyages, too, thought it expedient to send him home.


1.4.25
375
ἔνθα δὴ ἵππους τε αὐτῷ δοὺς οὓς αὐτὸς ἐπεθύμει λαβεῖν καὶ ἄλλα συσκευάσας πολλὰ ἔπεμπε καὶ διὰ τὸ φιλεῖν αὐτὸν καὶ ἅμα ἐλπίδας ἔχων μεγάλας ἐν αὐτῷ ἄνδρα ἔσεσθαι ἱκανὸν καὶ φίλους ὠφελεῖν καὶ ἐχθροὺς ἀνιᾶν .
So he let him go and not only gave him the horses that he desired to take, but he packed up many other things for him because of his love for him and also because he cherished high hopes that his grandson would be a man able both to help his friends and to give trouble to his enemies.


1.4.25
376
ἀπιόντα δὲ τὸν Κῦρον προύπεμπον πάντες καὶ παῖδες καὶ ἥλικες καὶ ἄνδρες καὶ γέροντες ἐφ’ ἵππων καὶ Ἀστυάγης αὐτός , καὶ οὐδένα ἔφασαν ὅντιν’ οὐ δακρύοντ’ ἀποστρέφεσθαι .
And everybody, both boys and men, young and old, and Astyages himself, escorted him on horseback as he went, and they say that there was no one who turned back without tears.


1.4.26
377
καὶ Κῦρον δὲ αὐτὸν λέγεται σὺν πολλοῖς δακρύοις ἀποχωρῆσαι .
And Cyrus also, it is said, departed very tearfully.


1.4.26
378
πολλὰ δὲ δῶρα διαδοῦναί φασιν αὐτὸν τοῖς ἡλικιώταις ὧν Ἀστυάγης αὐτῷ ἐδεδώκει , τέλος δὲ καὶ ἣν εἶχε στολὴν τὴν Μηδικὴν ἐκδύντα δοῦναί τινι , δηλοῦνθ’ ὅτι τοῦτον μάλιστα ἠσπάζετο .
And they say that he distributed as presents among his young friends many of the things that Astyages had given to him; and finally he took off the Median robe which he had on and gave it to one whom he loved very dearly.


1.4.26
379
τοὺς μέντοι λαβόντας καὶ δεξαμένους τὰ δῶρα λέγεται Ἀστυάγει ἀπενεγκεῖν , Ἀστυάγην δὲ δεξάμενον Κύρῳ ἀποπέμψαι , τὸν δὲ πάλιν τε ἀποπέμψαι εἰς Μήδους καὶ εἰπεῖν ·
It is said, however, that those who received and accepted his presents carried them to Astyages, and Astyages received them and returned them to Cyrus;


1.4.26
380
εἰ βούλει , ὦ πάππε , ἐμὲ καὶ πάλιν ἰέναι ὡς σὲ μὴ αἰσχυνόμενον , ἔα ἔχειν εἴ τῴ τι ἐγὼ δέδωκα ·
but Cyrus sent them back again to Media with this message: If you wish me ever to come back to you again, grandfather, without having to be ashamed, permit those to whom I have given anything to keep it.


1.4.26
381
Ἀστυάγην δὲ ταῦτα ἀκούσαντα ποιῆσαι ὥσπερ Κῦρος ἐπέστειλεν .
And when Astyages heard this, he did as Cyrus’s letter bade.


1.4.27
382
εἰ δὲ δεῖ καὶ παιδικοῦ λόγου ἐπιμνησθῆναι , λέγεται , ὅτε Κῦρος ἀπῄει καὶ ἀπηλλάττοντο ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων , τοὺς συγγενεῖς φιλοῦντας τῷ στόματι ἀποπέμπεσθαι αὐτὸν νόμῳ Περσικῷ ·
Now, if we may relate a sentimental story, we are told that when Cyrus was going away and they were taking leave of one another, his kinsmen bade him good-bye, after the Persian custom, with a kiss upon his lips.


1.4.27
383
καὶ γὰρ νῦν ἔτι τοῦτο ποιοῦσι Πέρσαι ·
And that custom has survived, for so the Persians do even to this day.


1.4.27
384
ἄνδρα δέ τινα τῶν Μήδων μάλα καλὸν κ- ἀγαθὸν ὄντα ἐκπεπλῆχθαι πολύν τινα χρόνον ἐπὶ τῷ κάλλει τοῦ Κύρου , ἡνίκα δὲ ἑώρα τοὺς συγγενεῖς φιλοῦντας αὐτόν , ὑπολειφθῆναι ·
Now a certain Median gentleman, very noble, had for some considerable time been struck with Cyrus’s beauty, and when he saw the boy’s kinsmen kissing him, he hung back.


1.4.27
385
ἐπεὶ δ’ οἱ ἄλλοι ἀπῆλθον , προσελθεῖν τῷ Κύρῳ καὶ εἰπεῖν ·
But when the rest were gone, he came up to Cyrus and said:


1.4.27
386
ἐμὲ μόνον οὐ γιγνώσκεις τῶν συγγενῶν , ὦ Κῦρε ;
Am I the only one of your kinsmen, Cyrus, whom you do not recognize as such?


1.4.27
387
τί δέ , εἰπεῖν τὸν Κῦρον , ἦ καὶ σὺ συγγενὴς εἶ ;
What said Cyrus, do you mean to say that you, too, are a kinsman?


1.4.27
388
μάλιστα , φάναι .
Certainly said he.


1.4.27
389
ταῦτ’ ἄρα , εἰπεῖν τὸν Κῦρον , καὶ ἐνεώρας μοι ·
That is the reason, then, it seems, said Cyrus, why you used to stare at me;


1.4.27
390
πολλάκις γὰρ δοκῶ σε γιγνώσκειν τοῦτο ποιοῦντα .
for if I am not mistaken, I have often noticed you doing so.


1.4.27
391
προσελθεῖν γάρ σοι , ἔφη , ἀεὶ βουλόμενος ναὶ μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς ᾐσχυνόμην .
Yes said he, for though I was always desirous of coming to you, by the gods I was too bashful.


1.4.27
392
ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἔδει , φάναι τὸν Κῦρον , συγγενῆ γε ὄντα ·
Well, you ought not to have been — at any rate, if you were my kinsman, said Cyrus;


1.4.27
393
ἅμα δὲ προσελθόντα φιλῆσαι αὐτόν .
and at the same time he went up and kissed him.


1.4.28
394
καὶ τὸν Μῆδον φιληθέντα ἐρέσθαι ·
And when he had been given the kiss, the Mede asked:


1.4.28
395
ἦ καὶ ἐν Πέρσαις νόμος ἐστὶν οὗτος συγγενεῖς φιλεῖν ;
Really, is it a custom in Persia to kiss one’s kinsfolk?


1.4.28
396
μάλιστα , φάναι , ὅταν γε ἴδωσιν ἀλλήλους διὰ χρόνου ἢ ἀπίωσί ποι ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων .
Certainly, said he; at least, when they see one another after a time of separation, or when they part from one another.


1.4.28
397
ὥρα ἂν εἴη , ἔφη ὁ Μῆδος , μάλα πάλιν σε φιλεῖν ἐμέ ·
It may be time, then, for you to kiss me once again, said the Mede;


1.4.28
398
ἀπέρχομαι γάρ , ὡς ὁρᾷς , ἤδη .
for, as you see, I am parting from you now.


1.4.28
399
οὕτω καὶ τὸν Κῦρον φιλήσαντα πάλιν ἀποπέμπειν καὶ ἀπιέναι .
And so Cyrus kissed him good-bye again and went on his way.


1.4.28
400
καὶ ὁδόν τε οὔπω πολλὴν διηνύσθαι αὐτοῖς καὶ τὸν Μῆδον ἥκειν πάλιν ἱδροῦντι τῷ ἵππῳ ·
But they had not yet gone far, when the Mede came back with his horse in a lather.


1.4.28
401
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον ἰδόντα , ἀλλ’ ἦ , φάναι , ἐπελάθου τι ὧν ἐβούλου εἰπεῖν ;
And when Cyrus saw him he said: Why, how now? Did you forget something that you intended to say?


1.4.28
402
μὰ Δία , φάναι , ἀλλ’ ἥκω διὰ χρόνου .
No, by Zeus, said he, but I have come back after a time of separation.


1.4.28
403
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον εἰπεῖν ·
Cyrus said.


1.4.28
404
νὴ Δί’ , ὦ σύγγενες , δι’ ὀλίγου γε .
By Zeus, cousin,  a pretty short time.


1.4.28
405
ποίου ὀλίγου ;
Short, is it?


1.4.28
406
εἰπεῖν τὸν Μῆδον .
 said the Mede;


1.4.28
407
οὐκ οἶσθα , φάναι , ὦ Κῦρε , ὅτι καὶ ὅσον σκαρδαμύττω χρόνον , πάνυ πολύς μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι , ὅτι οὐχ ὁρῶ σε τότε τοιοῦτον ὄντα ;
 don’t you know, Cyrus, said he, that even the time it takes me to wink seems an eternity to me, because during that time I do not see you, who are so handsome?


1.4.28
408
ἐνταῦθα δὴ τὸν Κῦρον γελάσαι τε ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν δακρύων καὶ εἰπεῖν αὐτῷ θαρρεῖν ἀπιόντι , ὅτι παρέσται αὐτοῖς ὀλίγου χρόνου , ὥστε ὁρᾶν ἐξέσται κἂν βούληται ἀσκαρδαμυκτί .
Then Cyrus laughed through his tears and bade him go and be of good cheer, for in a little while he would come back to them, so that he might soon look at him — without winking, if he chose.


1.5.1
409
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κῦρος οὕτως ἀπελθὼν ἐν Πέρσαις ἐνιαυτὸν λέγεται ἐν τοῖς παισὶν ἔτι γενέσθαι .
Now when Cyrus had returned, as before narrated, he is said to have spent one more year in the class of boys in Persia.


1.5.1
410
καὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον οἱ παῖδες ἔσκωπτον αὐτὸν ὡς ἡδυπαθεῖν ἐν Μήδοις μεμαθηκὼς ἥκοι ·
And at first the boys were inclined to make fun of him, saying that he had come back after having learned to live a life of luxurious ease among the Medes.


1.5.1
411
ἐπεὶ δὲ καὶ ἐσθίοντα αὐτὸν ἑώρων ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἡδέως καὶ πίνοντα , καὶ εἴ ποτε ἐν ἑορτῇ εὐωχία γένοιτο , ἐπιδιδόντα μᾶλλον αὐτὸν τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ μέρους ᾐσθάνοντο ἢ προσδεόμενον , καὶ πρὸς τούτοις δὲ τ- ἄλλα κρατιστεύοντα αὐτὸν ἑώρων ἑαυτῶν , ἐνταῦθα δὴ πάλιν ὑπέπτησσον αὐτῷ οἱ ἥλικες .
But when they saw him eating and drinking with no less relish than they themselves, and, if there ever was feasting at any celebration, freely giving away a part of his own share rather than asking for more; and when, in addition to this, they saw him surpassing them in other things as well, then again his comrades began to have proper respect for him.


1.5.1
412
ἐπεὶ δὲ διελθὼν τὴν παιδείαν ταύτην ἤδη εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τοὺς ἐφήβους , ἐν τούτοις αὖ ἐδόκει κρατιστεύειν καὶ μελετῶν ἃ χρῆν καὶ καρτερῶν καὶ αἰδούμενος τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους καὶ πειθόμενος τοῖς ἄρχουσι .
And when he had passed through this discipline and had now entered the class of the youths, among these in turn he had the reputation of being the best both in attending to duty and in endurance, in respect toward his elders and in obedience to the officers.


1.5.2
413
προϊόντος δὲ τοῦ χρόνου ὁ μὲν Ἀστυάγης ἐν τοῖς Μήδοις ἀποθνῄσκει , ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης ὁ τοῦ Ἀστυάγους παῖς , τῆς δὲ Κύρου μητρὸς ἀδελφός , τὴν βασιλείαν ἔσχε τὴν Μήδων .
In the course of time Astyages died in Media,


1.5.2
414
ὁ δὲ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων βασιλεὺς κατεστραμμένος μὲν πάντας Σύρους , φῦλον πάμπολυ , ὑπήκοον δὲ πεποιημένος τὸν Ἀραβίων βασιλέα , ὑπηκόους δὲ ἔχων ἤδη καὶ Ὑρκανίους , πολιορκῶν δὲ καὶ Βακτρίους , ἐνόμιζεν , εἰ τοὺς Μήδους ἀσθενεῖς ποιήσειε , πάντων γε τῶν πέριξ ῥᾳδίως ἄρξειν ·
and Cyaxares, the son of Astyages and brother of Cyrus’s mother, succeeded to the Median throne.


1.5.2
415
ἰσχυρότατον γὰρ τῶν ἐγγὺς φύλων τοῦτο ἐδόκει εἶναι .
At that time the king of Assyria had subjugated all Syria, a very large nation, and had made the king of Arabia his vassal; he already had Hyrcania under his dominion and was closely besetting Bactria. So he thought that if he should break the power of the Medes, he should easily obtain dominion over all the nations round about; for he considered the Medes the strongest of the neighbouring tribes.


1.5.3
416
οὕτω δὴ διαπέμπει πρός τε τοὺς ὑπ’ αὐτὸν πάντας καὶ πρὸς Κροῖσον τὸν Λυδῶν βασιλέα καὶ πρὸς τὸν Καππαδοκῶν καὶ πρὸς Φρύγας ἀμφοτέρους καὶ πρὸς Παφλαγόνας καὶ Ἰνδοὺς καὶ πρὸς Κᾶρας καὶ Κίλικας , τὰ μὲν καὶ διαβάλλων τοὺς Μήδους καὶ Πέρσας , λέγων ὡς μεγάλα τ’ εἴη ταῦτα ἔθνη καὶ ἰσχυρὰ καὶ συνεστηκότα εἰς τ- αὐτό , καὶ ἐπιγαμίας ἀλλήλοις πεποιημένοι εἶεν , καὶ κινδυνεύσοιεν , εἰ μή τις αὐτοὺς φθάσας ἀσθενώσοι , ἐπὶ ἓν ἕκαστον τῶν ἐθνῶν ἰόντες καταστρέψασθαι .
Accordingly, he sent around to all those under his sway and to Croesus, the king of Lydia, to the king of Cappadocia; to both Phrygias, to Paphlagonia, India, Caria, and Cilicia; and to a certain extent also he misrepresented the Medes and Persians, for he said that they were great, powerful nations, that they had intermarried with each other, and were united in common interests, and that unless some one attacked them first and broke their power, they would be likely to make war upon each one of the nations singly and subjugate them.


1.5.3
417
οἱ μὲν δὴ καὶ τοῖς λόγοις τούτοις πειθόμενοι συμμαχίαν αὐτῷ ἐποιοῦντο , οἱ δὲ καὶ δώροις καὶ χρήμασιν ἀναπειθόμενοι ·
Some, then, entered into an alliance with him because they actually believed what he said;


1.5.3
418
πολλὰ γὰρ καὶ τοιαῦτα ἦν αὐτῷ .
others, because they were bribed with gifts and money, for he had great wealth.


1.5.4
419
Κυαξάρης δὲ ὁ τοῦ Ἀστυάγους παῖς ἐπεὶ ᾐσθάνετο τήν τ’ ἐπιβουλὴν καὶ τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν συνισταμένων ἐφ’ ἑαυτόν , αὐτός τε εὐθέως ὅσα ἐδύνατο ἀντιπαρεσκευάζετο καὶ εἰς Πέρσας ἔπεμπε πρός τε τὸ κοινὸν καὶ πρὸς Καμβύσην τὸν τὴν ἀδελφὴν ἔχοντα καὶ βασιλεύοντα ἐν Πέρσαις .
Now when Cyaxares heard of the plot and of the warlike preparations of the nations allied against him,


1.5.4
420
ἔπεμπε δὲ καὶ πρὸς Κῦρον , δεόμενος αὐτοῦ πειρᾶσθαι ἄρχοντα ἐλθεῖν τῶν ἀνδρῶν , εἴ τινας πέμποι στρατιώτας τὸ Περσῶν κοινόν .
without delay he made what counter preparations he could himself and also sent to Persia both to the general assembly and to his brother-in-law, Cambyses, who was king of Persia.


1.5.4
421
ἤδη γὰρ καὶ ὁ Κῦρος διατετελεκὼς τὰ ἐν τοῖς ἐφήβοις δέκα ἔτη ἐν τοῖς τελείοις ἀνδράσιν ἦν .
And he sent word to Cyrus, too, asking him to try to come as commander of the men, in case the Persian state should send any troops. For Cyrus had by this time completed his ten years among the youths also and was now in the class of mature men.


1.5.5
422
οὕτω δὴ δεξαμένου τοῦ Κύρου οἱ βουλεύοντες γεραίτεροι αἱροῦνται αὐτὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς εἰς Μήδους στρατιᾶς .
So Cyrus accepted the invitation, and the elders in council chose him commander of the expedition to Media.


1.5.5
423
ἔδοσαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ προσελέσθαι διακοσίους τῶν ὁμοτίμων , τῶν δ’ αὖ διακοσίων ἑκάστῳ τέτταρας ἔδωκαν προσελέσθαι καὶ τούτους ἐκ τῶν ὁμοτίμων ·
And they further permitted him to choose two hundred peers to accompany him, and to each one of the two hundred peers in turn they gave authority to choose four more, these also from the peers.


1.5.5
424
γίγνονται μὲν δὴ οὗτοι χίλιοι ·
That made a thousand.


1.5.5
425
τῶν δ’ αὖ χιλίων τούτων ἑκάστῳ ἔταξαν ἐκ τοῦ δήμου τῶν Περσῶν δέκα μὲν πελταστὰς προσελέσθαι , δέκα δὲ σφενδονήτας , δέκα δὲ τοξότας ·
And each one of the thousand in their turn they bade choose in addition from the common people of the Persians ten targeteers, ten slingers, and ten bowmen.


1.5.5
426
καὶ οὕτως ἐγένοντο μύριοι μὲν τοξόται , μύριοι δὲ πελτασταί , μύριοι δὲ σφενδονῆται ·
That made ten thousand bowmen, ten thousand targeteers, and ten thousand slingers —


1.5.5
427
χωρὶς δὲ τούτων οἱ χίλιοι ὑπῆρχον .
not counting the original thousand.


1.5.5
428
τοσαύτη μὲν δὴ στρατιὰ τῷ Κύρῳ ἐδόθη .
So large was the army given to Cyrus.


1.5.6
429
ἐπεὶ δὲ ᾑρέθη τάχιστα , ἤρχετο πρῶτον ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν ·
Now as soon as he was chosen, his first act was to consult the gods;


1.5.6
430
καλλιερησάμενος δὲ τότε προσῃρεῖτο τοὺς διακοσίους ·
and not till he had sacrificed and the omens were propitious, did he proceed to choose his two hundred men.


1.5.6
431
ἐπεὶ δὲ προσείλοντο καὶ οὗτοι δὴ τοὺς τέτταρας ἕκαστοι , συνέλεξεν αὐτοὺς καὶ εἶπε τότε πρῶτον ἐν αὐτοῖς τάδε .
And when these also had chosen each his four, he called them all together and then addressed them for the first time as follows:


1.5.7
432
ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἐγὼ προσειλόμην μὲν ὑμᾶς , οὐ νῦν πρῶτον δοκιμάσας , ἀλλ’ ἐκ παίδων ὁρῶν ὑμᾶς ἃ μὲν καλὰ ἡ πόλις νομίζει , προθύμως ταῦτα ἐκπονοῦντας , ἃ δὲ αἰσχρὰ ἡγεῖται , παντελῶς τούτων ἀπεχομένους .
My friends, I have chosen you not because I now see your worth for the first time, but because I have observed that from your boyhood on you have been zealously following out all that the state considers right and abstaining altogether from all that it regards as wrong.


1.5.7
433
ὧν δ’ ἕνεκα αὐτός τε οὐκ ἄκων εἰς τόδε τὸ τέλος κατέστην καὶ ὑμᾶς παρεκάλεσα δηλῶσαι ὑμῖν βούλομαι .
As for myself, I wish to make known to you why I have not hesitated to assume this office and why I have invited you to join me.


1.5.8
434
ἐγὼ γὰρ κατενόησα ὅτι οἱ πρόγονοι χείρονες μὲν ἡμῶν οὐδὲν ἐγένοντο ·
I have come to realize that our forefathers were no whit worse than we.


1.5.8
435
ἀσκοῦντες γοῦν κ- ἐκεῖνοι διετέλεσαν ἅπερ ἔργα ἀρετῆς νομίζεται ·
At any rate, they also spent their time in practising what are considered the works of virtue.


1.5.8
436
ὅ τι μέντοι προσεκτήσαντο τοιοῦτοι ὄντες ἢ τῷ τῶν Περσῶν κοινῷ ἀγαθὸν ἢ αὑτοῖς , τοῦτ’ οὐκέτι δύναμαι ἰδεῖν .
However, what they gained by being what they were, either for the commonwealth of the Persians or for themselves, I can by no means discover.


1.5.9
437
καίτοι ἐγὼ οἶμαι οὐδεμίαν ἀρετὴν ἀσκεῖσθαι ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων ὡς μηδὲν πλέον ἔχωσιν οἱ ἐσθλοὶ γενόμενοι τῶν πονηρῶν , ἀλλ’ οἵ τε τῶν παραυτίκα ἡδονῶν ἀπεχόμενοι οὐχ ἵνα μηδέποτε εὐφρανθῶσι , τοῦτο πράττουσιν , ἀλλ’ ὡς διὰ ταύτην τὴν ἐγκράτειαν πολλαπλάσια εἰς τὸν ἔπειτα χρόνον εὐφρανούμενοι οὕτω παρασκευάζονται ·
And yet I think that no virtue is practised by men except with the aim that the good, by being such, may have something more than the bad;


1.5.9
438
οἵ τε λέγειν προθυμούμενοι δεινοὶ γενέσθαι οὐχ ἵνα εὖ λέγοντες μηδέποτε παύσωνται , τοῦτο μελετῶσιν , ἀλλ’ ἐλπίζοντες τῷ λέγειν εὖ πείθοντες ἀνθρώπους πολλὰ καὶ μεγάλα ἀγαθὰ διαπράξεσθαι ·
and I believe that those who abstain from present pleasures do this not that they may never enjoy themselves, but by this self-restraint they prepare themselves to have many times greater enjoyment in time to come.


1.5.9
439
οἵ τε αὖ τὰ πολεμικὰ ἀσκοῦντες οὐχ ὡς μαχόμενοι μηδέποτε παύσωνται , τοῦτ’ ἐκπονοῦσιν , ἀλλὰ νομίζοντες καὶ οὗτοι τὰ πολεμικὰ ἀγαθοὶ γενόμενοι πολὺν μὲν ὄλβον , πολλὴν δὲ εὐδαιμονίαν , μεγάλας δὲ τιμὰς καὶ ἑαυτοῖς καὶ πόλει περιάψειν .
And those who are eager to become able speakers study oratory, not that they may never cease from speaking eloquently, but in the hope that by their eloquence they may persuade men and accomplish great good.


1.5.10
440
εἰ δέ τινες ταῦτα ἐκπονήσαντες πρίν τινα καρπὸν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν κομίσασθαι περιεῖδον αὑτοὺς γήρᾳ ἀδυνάτους γενομένους , ὅμοιον ἔμοιγε δοκοῦσι πεπονθέναι οἷον εἴ τις γεωργὸς ἀγαθὸς προθυμηθεὶς γενέσθαι καὶ εὖ σπείρων καὶ εὖ φυτεύων , ὁπότε καρποῦσθαι ταῦτα δέοι , ἐῴη τὸν καρπὸν ἀσυγκόμιστον εἰς τὴν γῆν πάλιν καταρρεῖν .
But when men go through all this toil and then allow themselves to become old and feeble before they reap any fruit of their labours, they seem to me at least to be like a man who, anxious to become a good farmer, should sow and plant well but, when harvest time came, should permit his crop to fall back again to the ground ungathered.


1.5.10
441
καὶ εἴ τίς γε ἀσκητὴς πολλὰ πονήσας καὶ ἀξιόνικος γενόμενος ἀναγώνιστος διατελέσειεν , οὐδ’ ἂν οὗτός μοι δοκεῖ δικαίως ἀναίτιος εἶναι ἀφροσύνης .
And again, if an athlete after long training and after getting himself in condition to win a victory should then persist in refusing to compete, not even he, I ween, would rightly be considered guiltless of folly.


1.5.11
442
ἀλλ’ ἡμεῖς , ὦ ἄνδρες , μὴ πάθωμεν ταῦτα , ἀλλ’ ἐπείπερ σύνισμεν ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ παίδων ἀρξάμενοι ἀσκηταὶ ὄντες τῶν καλῶν κ- ἀγαθῶν ἔργων , ἴωμεν ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους , οὓς ἐγὼ σαφῶς ἐπίσταμαι ἰδιώτας ὄντας ὡς πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀγωνίζεσθαι .
But, fellow-soldiers, let us not make this mistake; but, conscious that from our boyhood on we have practised what is good and honourable, let us go against the enemy, who, I am sure, are too untrained to contend against us.


1.5.11
443
οὐ γάρ πω οὗτοι ἱκανοί εἰσιν ἀγωνισταί , οἳ ἂν τοξεύωσι καὶ ἀκοντίζωσι καὶ ἱππεύωσιν ἐπιστημόνως , ἢν δέ που πονῆσαι δέῃ , τούτῳ λείπωνται , ἀλλ’ οὗτοι ἰδιῶταί εἰσι κατὰ τοὺς πόνους ·
For those men are not yet valiant warriors, who, however skilful in the use of bow or spear and in horsemanship, are still found wanting if it is ever necessary to suffer hardship; such persons are mere tiros when it comes to hardships.


1.5.11
444
οὐδέ γε οἵτινες ἀγρυπνῆσαι δέον ἡττῶνται τούτου , ἀλλὰ καὶ οὗτοι ἰδιῶται κατὰ τὸν ὕπνον ·
Nor are those men valiant warriors, who are found wanting when it is necessary to keep awake; but these also are mere tiros in the face of sleep.


1.5.11
445
οὐδέ γε οἱ ταῦτα μὲν ἱκανοί , ἀπαίδευτοι δὲ ὡς χρὴ καὶ συμμάχοις καὶ πολεμίοις χρῆσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ οὗτοι δῆλον ὡς τῶν μεγίστων παιδευμάτων ἀπείρως ἔχουσιν .
Nor yet are those men valiant warriors, who have these qualifications but have not been taught how they ought to treat comrades and how to treat enemies, but it is evident that they also are unacquainted with the most important branches of education.


1.5.12
446
ὑμεῖς δὲ νυκτὶ μὲν δήπου ὅσαπερ οἱ ἄλλοι ἡμέρᾳ δύναισθ’ ἂν χρῆσθαι , πόνους δὲ τοῦ ζῆν ἡδέως ἡγεμόνας νομίζετε , λιμῷ δὲ ὅσαπερ ὄψῳ διαχρῆσθε , ὑδροποσίαν δὲ ῥᾷον τῶν λεόντων φέρετε , κάλλιστον δὲ πάντων καὶ πολεμικώτατον κτῆμα εἰς τὰς ψυχὰς συγκεκόμισθε ·
Now you, I take it, could make use of the night just as others do of the day; and you consider toil the guide to a happy life; hunger you use regularly as a sauce, and you endure drinking plain water more readily than lions do,


1.5.12
447
ἐπαινούμενοι γὰρ μᾶλλον ἢ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασι χαίρετε .
while you have stored up in your souls that best of all possessions and the one most suitable to war: I mean, you enjoy praise more than anything else;


1.5.12
448
τοὺς δ’ ἐπαίνου ἐραστὰς ἀνάγκη διὰ τοῦτο πάντα μὲν πόνον , πάντα δὲ κίνδυνον ἡδέως ὑποδύεσθαι .
and lovers of praise must for this reason gladly undergo every sort of hardship and every sort of danger.


1.5.13
449
εἰ δὲ ταῦτα ἐγὼ λέγω περὶ ὑμῶν ἄλλῃ γιγνώσκων , ἐμαυτὸν ἐξαπατῶ .
Now if I say this concerning you while I believe the contrary to be true, I deceive myself utterly.


1.5.13
450
ὅ τι γὰρ μὴ τοιοῦτον ἀποβήσεται παρ’ ὑμῶν , εἰς ἐμὲ τὸ ἐλλεῖπον ἥξει .
For if any of these qualities shall fail to be forthcoming in you, the loss will fall on me.


1.5.13
451
ἀλλὰ πιστεύω τοι τῇ πείρᾳ καὶ τῇ ὑμῶν εἰς ἐμὲ εὐνοίᾳ καὶ τῇ τῶν πολεμίων ἀνοίᾳ μὴ ψεύσειν με ταύτας τὰς ἀγαθὰς ἐλπίδας .
But I feel confident, you see, both from my own experience and from your good-will toward me and from the ignorance of the enemy that these sanguine hopes will not deceive me.


1.5.13
452
ἀλλὰ θαρροῦντες ὁρμώμεθα , ἐπειδὴ καὶ ἐκποδὼν ἡμῖν γεγένηται τὸ δόξαι τῶν ἀλλοτρίων ἀδίκως ἐφίεσθαι .
So let us set out with good heart, since we are free from the suspicion of even seeming to aim unjustly at other men’s possessions.


1.5.13
453
νῦν γὰρ ἔρχονται μὲν οἱ πολέμιοι ἄρχοντες ἀδίκων χειρῶν , καλοῦσι δὲ ἡμᾶς ἐπικούρους οἱ φίλοι ·
For, as it is, the enemy are coming, aggressors in wrong, and our friends are calling us to their assistance.


1.5.13
454
τί οὖν ἐστιν ἢ τοῦ ἀλέξασθαι δικαιότερον ἢ τοῦ τοῖς φίλοις ἀρήγειν κάλλιον ;
What, then, is more justifiable than to defend oneself, or what more noble than to assist one’s friends?


1.5.14
455
ἀλλὰ μὴν κ- ἐκεῖνο οἶμαι ὑμᾶς θαρρεῖν , τὸ μὴ παρημεληκότα με τῶν θεῶν τὴν ἔξοδον ποιεῖσθαι ·
This, moreover, will, I think, strengthen your confidence: I have not neglected the gods as we embark upon this expedition.


1.5.14
456
πολλὰ γάρ μοι συνόντες ἐπίστασθε οὐ μόνον τὰ μεγάλα ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ μικρὰ πειρώμενον ἀεὶ ἀπὸ θεῶν ὁρμᾶσθαι .
For you have been with me enough to know that not only in great things but also in small I always try to begin with the approval of the gods.


1.5.14
457
τέλος εἶπε ·
What more need I add?


1.5.14
458
τί δεῖ ἔτι λέγειν ;
he said in closing.


1.5.14
459
ἀλλ’ ὑμεῖς μὲν τοὺς ἄνδρας ἑλόμενοι καὶ ἀναλαβόντες καὶ τ- ἄλλα παρασκευασάμενοι ἴτε ἐς Μήδους ·
Choose you your men and get them together, and when you have made the necessary preparations come on to Media.


1.5.14
460
ἐγὼ δ’ ἐπανελθὼν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα πρόειμι δή , ὅπως τὰ τῶν πολεμίων ὡς τάχιστα μαθὼν οἷά ἐστι παρασκευάζωμαι ὅ τι ἂν δέωμαι , ὅπως ὡς κάλλιστα σὺν θεῷ ἀγωνιζώμεθα .
As for myself, I will first return to my father and then go on ahead of you, to learn as soon as possible what the plans of the enemy are and to make what preparations I may require, in order that with God’s help we may make as good a fight as possible.


1.5.14
461
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἔπραττον .
They, for their part, proceeded to do as he had said.


1.6.1
462
Κῦρος δὲ ἐλθὼν οἴκαδε καὶ προσευξάμενος Ἑστίᾳ πατρῴᾳ καὶ Διὶ πατρῴῳ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις θεοῖς ὡρμᾶτο ἐπὶ τὴν στρατείαν , συμπρούπεμπε δὲ αὐτὸν καὶ ὁ πατήρ .
Now, when Cyrus had gone home and prayed to ancestral Hestia, ancestral Zeus, and the rest of the gods, he set out upon his expedition; and his father also joined in escorting him on his way.


1.6.1
463
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἔξω τῆς οἰκίας ἐγένοντο , λέγονται ἀστραπαὶ καὶ βρονταὶ αὐτῷ αἴσιοι γενέσθαι .
And when they were out of the house, it is said to have thundered and lightened with happy auspices for him;


1.6.1
464
τούτων δὲ φανέντων οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἔτι οἰωνιζόμενοι ἐπορεύοντο , ὡς οὐδένα ἂν λύσαντα τὰ τοῦ μεγίστου θεοῦ σημεῖα .
and when this manifestation had been made, they proceeded, without taking any further auspices, in the conviction that no one would make void the signs of the supreme god.


1.6.2
465
προϊόντι δὲ τῷ Κύρῳ ὁ πατὴρ ἤρχετο λόγου τοιοῦδε .
Then, as they went on, his father began to speak to Cyrus on this wise:


1.6.2
466
ὦ παῖ , ὅτι μὲν οἱ θεοὶ ἵλεῴ τε καὶ εὐμενεῖς πέμπουσί σε καὶ ἐν ἱεροῖς δῆλον καὶ ἐν οὐρανίοις σημείοις ·
My son, it is evident both from the sacrifices and from the signs from the skies that the gods are sending you forth with their grace and favour;


1.6.2
467
γιγνώσκεις δὲ καὶ αὐτός .
and you yourself must recognize it,


1.6.2
468
ἐγὼ γάρ σε ταῦτα ἐπίτηδες ἐδιδαξάμην , ὅπως μὴ δι’ ἄλλων ἑρμηνέων τὰς τῶν θεῶν συμβουλίας συνιείης , ἀλλ’ αὐτὸς καὶ ὁρῶν τὰ ὁρατὰ καὶ ἀκούων τὰ ἀκουστὰ γιγνώσκοις καὶ μὴ ἐπὶ μάντεσιν εἴης , εἰ βούλοιντό σε ἐξαπατᾶν ἕτερα λέγοντες ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν θεῶν σημαινόμενα , μηδ’ αὖ , εἴ ποτε ἄρα ἄνευ μάντεως γένοιο , ἀποροῖο θείοις σημείοις ὅ τι χρῷο , ἀλλὰ γιγνώσκων διὰ τῆς μαντικῆς τὰ παρὰ τῶν θεῶν συμβουλευόμενα , τούτοις πείθοιο .
for I had you taught this art on purpose that you might not have to learn the counsels of the gods through others as interpreters, but that you yourself, both seeing what is to be seen and hearing what is to be heard, might understand; for I would not have you at the mercy of the soothsayers, in case they should wish to deceive you by saying other things than those revealed by the gods; and furthermore, if ever you should be without a soothsayer, I would not have you in doubt as to what to make of the divine revelations, but by your soothsayer’s art I would have you understand the counsels of the gods and obey them.


1.6.3
469
καὶ μὲν δή , ὦ πάτερ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὡς ἂν ἵλεῳ οἱ θεοὶ ὄντες ἡμῖν συμβουλεύειν θέλωσιν , ὅσον δύναμαι κατὰ τὸν σὸν λόγον διατελῶ ἐπιμελούμενος .
Aye, father, said Cyrus,as you have taught me, I always try to take care, as far as I can, that the gods may be gracious unto us and willingly give us counsel;


1.6.3
470
μέμνημαι γάρ , ἔφη , ἀκούσας ποτέ σου ὅτι εἰκότως ἂν καὶ παρὰ θεῶν πρακτικώτερος εἴη ὥσπερ καὶ παρ’ ἀνθρώπων ὅστις μὴ ὁπότε ἐν ἀπόροις εἴη , τότε κολακεύοι , ἀλλ’ ὅτε τὰ ἄριστα πράττοι , τότε μάλιστα τῶν θεῶν μεμνῇτο ·
for I remember, said he, having once heard you say that that man would be more likely to have power with the gods, even as with men, who did not fawn upon them when he was in adversity, but remembered the gods most of all when he was in the highest prosperity.


1.6.3
471
καὶ τῶν φίλων δ’ ἔφησθα χρῆναι ὡσαύτως οὕτως ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
And for one’s friends also, you said, one ought always to show one’s regard in precisely the same way.


1.6.4
472
οὐκοῦν νῦν , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , διά γ’ ἐκείνας τὰς ἐπιμελείας ἥδιον μὲν ἔρχῃ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς δεησόμενος , ἐλπίζεις δὲ μᾶλλον τεύξεσθαι ὧν ἂν δέῃ , ὅτι συνειδέναι σαυτῷ δοκεῖς οὐπώποτ’ ἀμελήσας αὐτῶν ;
Well, my son, said he, and owing to that very regard do you not come to the gods with a better heart to pray, and do you not expect more confidently to obtain what you pray for, because you feel conscious of never having neglected them?


1.6.4
473
πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , ὡς πρὸς φίλους μοι ὄντας τοὺς θεοὺς οὕτω διάκειμαι .
Yes, indeed, father, said he; I feel toward the gods as if they were my friends.


1.6.5
474
τί γάρ , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , μέμνησαι ἐκεῖνα ἅ ποτε ἐδόκει ἡμῖν , ὡς ἅπερ δεδώκασιν οἱ θεοὶ μαθόντας ἀνθρώπους βέλτιον πράττειν ἢ ἀνεπιστήμονας αὐτῶν ὄντας καὶ ἐργαζομένους μᾶλλον ἁνύτειν ἢ ἀργοῦντας καὶ ἐπιμελουμένους ἀσφαλέστερον ἂν διάγειν ἢ ἀφυλακτοῦντας τούτων , — παρέχοντας οὖν τοιούτους ἑαυτοὺς οἵους δεῖ , οὕτως ἡμῖν ἐδόκει δεῖν καὶ αἰτεῖσθαι τ- ἀγαθὰ παρὰ τῶν θεῶν ;
To be sure,  said his father;  and do you remember the conclusion which once we reached — that as people who know what the gods have granted fare better than those who do not; as people who work accomplish more than those who are idle; as people who are careful live more securely than those who are indifferent; so in this matter it seemed to us that those only who had made themselves what they ought to be had a right to ask for corresponding blessings from the gods?


1.6.6
475
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , μέμνημαι μέντοι τοιαῦτα ἀκούσας σου ·
Yes, by Zeus, said Cyrus; I do indeed remember hearing you say so,


1.6.6
476
καὶ γὰρ ἀνάγκη με πείθεσθαι τῷ λόγῳ ·
and all the more because I could not help but agree with what you said.


1.6.6
477
καὶ γὰρ οἶδά σε λέγοντα ἀεὶ ὡς οὐδὲ θέμις εἴη αἰτεῖσθαι παρὰ τῶν θεῶν οὔτε ἱππεύειν μὴ μαθόντας ἱππομαχοῦντας νικᾶν , οὔτε μὴ ἐπισταμένους τοξεύειν τοξεύοντας κρατεῖν τῶν ἐπισταμένων , οὔτε μὴ ἐπισταμένους κυβερνᾶν σῴζειν εὔχεσθαι ναῦς κυβερνῶντας , οὐδὲ μὴ σπείροντάς γε σῖτον εὔχεσθαι καλὸν αὐτοῖς φύεσθαι , οὐδὲ μὴ φυλαττομένους γε ἐν πολέμῳ σωτηρίαν αἰτεῖσθαι ·
For I know that you always used to say that those who had not learned to ride had no right to ask the gods to give them victory in a cavalry battle; and those who did not know how to shoot had no right to ask to excel in marksmanship those who did know how; and those who did not know how to steer had no right to pray that they might save ships by taking the helm; neither had those who did not sow at all any right to pray for a fine crop, nor those who were not watchful in war to ask for preservation;


1.6.6
478
παρὰ γὰρ τοὺς τῶν θεῶν θεσμοὺς πάντα τὰ τοιαῦτα εἶναι ·
for all that is contrary to the ordinances of the gods.


1.6.6
479
τοὺς δὲ ἀθέμιτα εὐχομένους ὁμοίως ἔφησθα εἰκὸς εἶναι παρὰ θεῶν ἀτυχεῖν ὥσπερ καὶ παρὰ ἀνθρώπων ἀπρακτεῖν τοὺς παράνομα δεομένους .
You said, moreover, that it was quite as likely that those who prayed for what was not right should fail of success with the gods as that those who asked for what was contrary to human law should be disappointed at the hands of men.


1.6.7
480
ἐκείνων δέ , ὦ παῖ , ἐπελάθου ἅ ποτε ἐγὼ καὶ σὺ ἐλογιζόμεθα ὡς ἱκανὸν εἴη καὶ καλὸν ἀνδρὶ ἔργον , εἴ τις δύναιτο ἐπιμεληθῆναι ὅπως ἂν αὐτός τε καλὸς κ- ἀγαθὸς δοκίμως γένοιτο καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια αὐτός τε καὶ οἱ οἰκέται ἱκανῶς ἔχοιεν ;
But, my son, have you forgotten the discussion you and I once had


1.6.7
481
τὸ δέ , τούτου μεγάλου ἔργου ὄντος , οὕτως ἐπίστασθαι ἀνθρώπων ἄλλων προστατεύειν ὅπως ἕξουσι πάντα τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἔκπλεω καὶ ὅπως ἔσονται πάντες οἵους δεῖ , τοῦτο θαυμαστὸν δήπου ἡμῖν τότε ἐφαίνετο εἶναι .
— that it was a great task and one worthy of a man, to do the best he could not only to prove himself a truly good and noble man but also to provide a good living both for himself and his household? And while this was a great task, still, to understand how to govern other people so that they might have all the necessaries of life in abundance and might all become what they ought to be, this seemed to us worthy of all admiration.


1.6.8
482
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , μέμνημαι καὶ τοῦτό σου λέγοντος ·
Yes, by Zeus, father, said he, I do remember your saying this also;


1.6.8
483
συνεδόκει οὖν καὶ ἐμοὶ ὑπερμέγεθες εἶναι ἔργον τὸ καλῶς ἄρχειν ·
and I agreed with you, too, that it was an exceedingly difficult task to govern well;


1.6.8
484
καὶ νῦν γ’ , ἔφη , τ- αὐτά μοι δοκεῖ ταῦτα , ὅταν πρὸς αὐτὸ τὸ ἄρχειν σκοπῶν λογίζωμαι .
and now, said he, I hold this same opinion still, when I consider the matter and think of the principles of governing.


1.6.8
485
ὅταν μέντοι γε πρὸς ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους ἰδὼν κατανοήσω οἷοι ὄντες διαγίγνονται ἄρχοντες καὶ οἷοι ὄντες ἀνταγωνισταὶ ἡμῖν ἔσονται , πάνυ μοι δοκεῖ αἰσχρὸν εἶναι τὸ τοιούτους ὑποπτῆξαι καὶ μὴ θέλειν ἰέναι αὐτοῖς ἀνταγωνιουμένους ·
When I look at other people, however, and observe what sort of men those are who, in spite of their character, continue to rule over them, and what sort of opponents we are going to have, it seems to me an utter disgrace to show any respect for such as they are and not to wish to go to fight them.


1.6.8
486
οὕς , ἔφη , ἐγὼ αἰσθάνομαι ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῶν ἡμετέρων φίλων τούτων ἡγουμένους δεῖν τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν ἀρχομένων διαφέρειν τῷ καὶ πολυτελέστερον δειπνεῖν καὶ πλέον ἔχειν ἔνδον χρυσίον καὶ πλείονα χρόνον καθεύδειν καὶ πάντα ἀπονώτερον τῶν ἀρχομένων διάγειν .
To begin with our own friends here, he continued, I observe that the Medes consider it necessary for the one who governs them to surpass the governed in greater sumptuousness of fare, in the possession of more money in his palace, in longer hours of sleep, and in a more luxurious manner of life, in every respect, than the governed.


1.6.8
487
ἐγὼ δὲ οἶμαι , ἔφη , τὸν ἄρχοντα οὐ τῷ ῥᾳδιουργεῖν χρῆναι διαφέρειν τῶν ἀρχομένων , ἀλλὰ τῷ προνοεῖν καὶ φιλοπονεῖν .
But I think, he added, that the ruler ought to surpass those under his rule not in self-indulgence, but in taking forethought and willingly undergoing toil.


1.6.9
488
ἀλλά τοι , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , ἔνιά ἐστιν ἃ οὐ πρὸς ἀνθρώπους ἀγωνιστέον , ἀλλὰ πρὸς αὐτὰ τὰ πράγματα , ὧν οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὐπόρως περιγενέσθαι .
But let me tell you, my boy, said the other, there are some instances in which we must wrestle not against men but against actual facts, and it is not so easy to get the better of these without trouble.


1.6.9
489
αὐτίκα δήπου οἶσθα ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἕξει τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἡ στρατιά , καταλελύσεταί σου ἡ ἀρχή .
For instance, you doubtless know that if your army does not receive its rations, your authority will soon come to naught.


1.6.9
490
οὐκοῦν ταῦτα μέν , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , Κυαξάρης φησὶ παρέξειν τοῖς ἐντεῦθεν ἰοῦσι πᾶσιν ὁπόσοι ἂν ὦσι .
Yes, father, said he; but Cyaxares says that he will furnish supplies for all who come from here, however many they be.


1.6.9
491
τούτοις δὴ σύ , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , πιστεύων ἔρχῃ , τοῖς παρὰ Κυαξάρου χρήμασιν ;
But, my son, said he, do you mean to say that you are marching out trusting to the funds at the command of Cyaxares?


1.6.9
492
ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
Yes, I do, said Cyrus.


1.6.9
493
τί δέ , ἔφη , οἶσθα ὁπόσα αὐτῷ ἔστι ;
But say, said his father, do you know how much he has?


1.6.9
494
μὰ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , οὐ μὲν δή .
No, by Zeus, said Cyrus, I know nothing about it.


1.6.9
495
ὅμως δὲ τούτοις πιστεύεις τοῖς ἀδήλοις ;
And do you nevertheless trust to these uncertainties?


1.6.9
496
ὅτι δὲ πολλῶν μὲν σοὶ δεήσει , πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα νῦν ἀνάγκη δαπανᾶν ἐκεῖνον , οὐ γιγνώσκεις ;
And do you not know that you will need many things and that he must now have many other expenses?


1.6.9
497
γιγνώσκω , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
Yes, said Cyrus, I do.


1.6.9
498
ἢν οὖν , ἔφη , ἐπιλίπῃ αὐτὸν ἡ δαπάνη ἢ καὶ ἑκὼν ψεύσηται , πῶς σοι ἕξει τὰ τῆς στρατιᾶς ;
Well, then, said he, if his resources fail or if he play you false on purpose, how will your army fare?


1.6.9
499
δῆλον ὅτι οὐ καλῶς .
Evidently not very well;


1.6.9
500
ἀτάρ , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , σὺ εἰ ἐνορᾷς τινα πόρον καὶ ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ ἂν προσγενόμενον , ἕως ἔτι ἐν φιλίᾳ ἐσμέν , λέγε .
but father, said he, if you have in mind any means that I might find at my own command for obtaining supplies, tell me about it, while we are still in a friendly country.


1.6.10
501
ἐρωτᾷς , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , ποῦ ἂν ἀπὸ σοῦ πόρος προσγένοιτο ;
Do you ask me, my son, said he, where you might yourself find means?


1.6.10
502
ἀπὸ τίνος δὲ μᾶλλον εἰκός ἐστι πόρον γενέσθαι ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ δύναμιν ἔχοντος ;
Where might you better look to find the means of obtaining supplies than to the one who has an army?


1.6.10
503
σὺ δὲ πεζὴν μὲν δύναμιν ἐνθένδε ἔχων ἔρχῃ ἀνθ’ ἧς οἶδ’ ὅτι πολλαπλασίαν ἄλλην οὐκ ἂν δέξαιο , ἱππικὸν δέ σοι , ὅπερ κράτιστον , τὸ Μήδων σύμμαχον ἔσται .
Now you are marching out from here with a force of infantry which you would not exchange, I am sure, for any other though many time as large; and you will have for cavalry to support you the Median horse, the best cavalry troops in the world.


1.6.10
504
ποῖον οὖν ἔθνος τῶν πέριξ οὐ δοκεῖ σοι καὶ χαρίζεσθαι βουλόμενον ὑμῖν ὑπηρετήσειν καὶ φοβούμενον μή τι πάθῃ ;
What nation, then, of those around do you suppose will refuse to serve you, both from the wish to do your side a favour, and for fear of suffering harm?


1.6.10
505
ἃ χρή σε κοινῇ σὺν Κυαξάρῃ σκοπεῖσθαι μήποτε ἐπιλίπῃ τι ὑμᾶς ὧν δεῖ ὑπάρχειν , καὶ ἔθους δὲ ἕνεκα μηχανᾶσθαι προσόδου πόρον .
And therefore in common with Cyaxares you should take care that you may never be without any of the things you need to have, and as a matter of habit, too, contrive some means of revenue.


1.6.10
506
τόδε δὲ πάντων μάλιστά μοι μέμνησο μηδέποτε ἀναμένειν τὸ πορίζεσθαι τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἔστ’ ἂν ἡ χρεία σε ἀναγκάσῃ ·
And above all I beg you to remember this: never postpone procuring supplies until want compels you to it;


1.6.10
507
ἀλλ’ ὅταν μάλιστα εὐπορῇς , τότε πρὸ τῆς ἀπορίας μηχανῶ .
but when you have the greatest abundance, then take measures against want.


1.6.10
508
καὶ γὰρ τεύξῃ μᾶλλον παρ’ ὧν ἂν δέῃ μὴ ἄπορος δοκῶν εἶναι , καὶ ἔτι ἀναίτιος ἔσῃ παρὰ τοῖς σαυτοῦ στρατιώταις ·
And this is most expedient; for you will obtain more from those upon whom you make demands, if you do not seem to be in want, and besides you will thus be blameless in the eyes of your own soldiers;


1.6.10
509
ἐκ τούτου δὲ μᾶλλον καὶ ὑπ’ ἄλλων αἰδοῦς τεύξῃ , καὶ ἤν τινας βούλῃ ἢ εὖ ποιῆσαι τῇ δυνάμει ἢ κακῶς , μᾶλλον ἕως ἂν ἔχωσι τὰ δέοντα οἱ στρατιῶται ὑπηρετήσουσί σοι , καὶ πειστικωτέρους , σάφ’ ἴσθι , λόγους δυνήσῃ τότε λέγειν ὅτανπερ καὶ ἐνδείκνυσθαι μάλιστα δύνῃ καὶ εὖ ποιεῖν ἱκανὸς ὢν καὶ κακῶς .
in this way, furthermore, you will command more respect from others also, and if you wish to do good or ill to any one with your forces, your soldiers will serve you better as long as they have what they need. And let me assure you that the words you say will have more power to convince, when you can abundantly prove that you are in a position to do both good and ill.


1.6.11
510
ἀλλ’ , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , ἄλλως τέ μοι καλῶς δοκεῖς ταῦτα λέγειν πάντα , καὶ ὅτι ὧν μὲν νῦν λέγονται λήψεσθαι οἱ στρατιῶται , οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν ἐμοὶ τούτων χάριν εἴσεται ·
Well, father, said he, it seems to me that you are right in all you say, both on other grounds and also because not one of my soldiers will be grateful to me for that which according to the agreement he is to receive;


1.6.11
511
ἴσασι γὰρ ἐφ’ οἷς αὐτοὺς Κυαξάρης ἐπάγεται συμμάχους ·
for they know on what terms Cyaxares is having them brought as his allies.


1.6.11
512
ὅ τι δ’ ἂν πρὸς τοῖς εἰρημένοις λαμβάνῃ τις , ταῦτα καὶ τιμὴν νομιοῦσι καὶ χάριν τούτων εἰκὸς εἰδέναι τῷ διδόντι .
But whatever any one receives in addition to what has been agreed upon, that he will consider as a reward, and he will probably be grateful to the giver.


1.6.11
513
τὸ δ’ ἔχοντα δύναμιν ᾗ ἔστι μὲν φίλους εὖ ποιοῦντα ἀντωφελεῖσθαι , ἔστι δὲ ἐχθροὺς ἔχοντα πειρᾶσθαι τείσασθαι , ἔπειτ’ ἀμελεῖν τοῦ πορίζεσθαι , οἴει τι , ἔφη , ἧττόν τι τοῦτο εἶναι αἰσχρὸν ἢ εἴ τις ἔχων μὲν ἀγρούς , ἔχων δὲ ἐργάτας οἷς ἂν ἐργάζοιτο , ἔπειτ’ ἐῴη τὴν ἀργοῦσαν ἀνωφέλητον εἶναι ;
But for a man to have an army with which he may do good to his friends and get help in return and try to punish his enemies, and for him then to neglect to make due provision for it, do you think, said he, that this is in any way less disgraceful than for a man to have fields and labourers to work them and after all to let his land lie idle and unprofitable?


1.6.11
514
ὥς γ’ ἐμοῦ , ἔφη , μηδέποτε ἀμελήσοντος τοῦ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τοῖς στρατιώταις συμμηχανᾶσθαι μήτ’ ἐν φιλίᾳ μήτ’ ἐν πολεμίᾳ οὕτως ἔχε τὴν γνώμην .
But, he added, I, at any rate, shall not fail to provide supplies for my men, whether in a friendly or in a hostile land — you may be certain of that.


1.6.12
515
τί γάρ , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , τῶν ἄλλων , ὧν ἐδόκει ποθ’ ἡμῖν ἀναγκαῖον εἶναι μὴ παραμελεῖν , ἦ μέμνησαι ;
Well then, my boy, said his father, tell me, do you remember the other points which, we agreed, must not be neglected — eh?


1.6.12
516
οὐ γάρ , ἔφη , μέμνημαι ὅτε ἐγὼ μὲν πρὸς σὲ ἦλθον ἐπ’ ἀργύριον , ὅπως ἀποδοίην τῷ φάσκοντι στρατηγεῖν με πεπαιδευκέναι , σὺ δὲ ἅμα διδούς μοι ἐπηρώτας ὧδέ πως ·
Yes, said he, I remember well when I came to you for money to pay to the man who professed to have taught me to be a general; and you, while you gave it me, asked a question something like this:


1.6.12
517
ἆρά γε , εἶπας , ὦ παῖ , ἐν τοῖς στρατηγικοῖς καὶ οἰκονομίας τί σοι ἐπεμνήσθη ὁ ἀνὴρ ᾧ τὸν μισθὸν φέρεις ;
Of course, you said, the man to whom you are taking the pay has given you instruction in domestic economy as a part of the duties of a general, has he not?


1.6.12
518
οὐδὲν μέντοι ἧττον οἱ στρατιῶται τῶν ἐπιτηδείων δέονται ἢ οἱ ἐν οἴκῳ οἰκέται .
At any rate, the soldiers need provisions no whit less than the servants in your house.


1.6.12
519
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐγώ σοι λέγων τ- ἀληθῆ εἶπον ὅτι οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν περὶ τούτου ἐπεμνήσθη , ἐπήρου με πάλιν εἴ τί μοι ὑγιείας πέρι ἢ ῥώμης ἔλεξεν , ὡς δεῆσον τούτων ὥσπερ καὶ τῆς στρατηγίας τὸν στρατηγὸν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
And when I told you the truth and said that he had given me no instruction whatever in this subject, you asked me further whether he had said anything to me about health or strength, inasmuch as it would be requisite for the general to take thought for these matters as well as for the conduct of his campaign.


1.6.13
520
ὡς δὲ καὶ ταῦτ’ ἀπέφησα , ἐπήρου με αὖ πάλιν εἴ τινας τέχνας ἐδίδαξεν , αἳ τῶν πολεμικῶν ἔργων κράτισται ἂν σύμμαχοι γένοιντο .
And when I said no to this also, you asked me once more whether he had taught me any arts that would be the best helps in the business of war.


1.6.13
521
ἀποφήσαντος δέ μου καὶ τοῦτο ἀνέκρινας αὖ σὺ καὶ τόδε εἴ τί μ’ ἐπαίδευσεν ὡς ἂν δυναίμην στρατιᾷ προθυμίαν ἐμβαλεῖν , λέγων ὅτι τὸ πᾶν διαφέρει ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ προθυμία ἀθυμίας .
And when I said no to this as well, you put this further question, whether he had put me through any training so that I might be able to inspire my soldiers with enthusiasm, adding that in every project enthusiasm or faintheartedness made all the difference in the world.


1.6.13
522
ἐπεὶ δὲ καὶ τοῦτο ἀνένευον , ἤλεγχες αὖ σὺ εἴ τινα λόγον ποιήσαιτο διδάσκων περὶ τοῦ πείθεσθαι τὴν στρατιάν , ὡς ἄν τις μάλιστα μηχανῷτο .
And when I shook my head in response to this likewise, you questioned me again whether he had given me any lessons to teach me how best to secure obedience on the part of an army.


1.6.14
523
ἐπεὶ δὲ καὶ τοῦτο παντάπασιν ἄρρητον ἐφαίνετο , τέλος δή μ’ ἐπήρου ὅ τι ποτὲ διδάσκων στρατηγίαν φαίη με διδάσκειν .
And when this also appeared not to have been discussed at all, you finally asked me what in the world he had been teaching me that he professed to have been teaching me generalship.


1.6.14
524
κ- ἐγὼ δὴ ἐνταῦθα ἀποκρίνομαι ὅτι τὰ τακτικά .
And thereupon I answered, tactics.


1.6.14
525
καὶ σὺ γελάσας διῆλθές μοι παρατιθεὶς ἕκαστον τί εἴη ὄφελος στρατιᾷ τακτικῶν ἄνευ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων , τί δ’ ἄνευ τοῦ ὑγιαίνειν , τί δ’ ἄνευ τοῦ ἐπίστασθαι τὰς ηὑρημένας εἰς πόλεμον τέχνας , G? τί δ’ ἄνευ τοῦ πείθεσθαι .
And you laughed and went through it all, explaining point by point, as you asked of what conceivable use tactics could be to an army, without provisions and health, and of what use it could be without the knowledge of the arts invented for warfare and without obedience.


1.6.14
526
ὡς δέ μοι καταφανὲς ἐποίησας ὅτι μικρόν τι μέρος εἴη στρατηγίας τὰ τακτικά , ἐπερομένου μου εἴ τι τούτων σύ με διδάξαι ἱκανὸς εἴης , ἀπιόντα με ἐκέλευσας τοῖς στρατηγικοῖς νομιζομένοις ἀνδράσι διαλέγεσθαι καὶ πυθέσθαι πῇ ἕκαστα τούτων γίγνεται .
And when you had made it clear to me that tactics was only a small part of generalship, I asked you if you could teach me any of those things, and you bade me go and talk with the men who were reputed to be masters of military science and find out how each one of those problems was to be met.


1.6.15
527
ἐκ τούτου δ’ ἐγὼ συνῆν τούτοις , οὓς μάλιστα φρονίμους περὶ τούτων ἤκουον εἶναι .
Thereupon I joined myself to those who I heard were most proficient in those branches.And in regard to provisions —


1.6.15
528
καὶ περὶ μὲν τροφῆς ἐπείσθην ἱκανὸν εἶναι ὑπάρχον ὅ τι Κυαξάρης ἔμελλε παρέξειν ἡμῖν , περὶ δὲ ὑγιείας , ἀκούων καὶ ὁρῶν ὅτι καὶ πόλεις αἱ χρῄζουσαι ὑγιαίνειν ἰατροὺς αἱροῦνται καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἕνεκεν ἰατροὺς ἐξάγουσιν , οὕτω καὶ ἐγὼ ἐπεὶ ἐν τῷ τέλει τούτῳ ἐγενόμην , εὐθὺς τούτου ἐπεμελήθην , καὶ οἶμαι , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , πάνυ ἱκανοὺς τὴν ἰατρικὴν τέχνην ἕξειν μετ’ ἐμαυτοῦ ἄνδρας .
I was persuaded that what Cyaxares was to furnish us was enough if it should be forthcoming; and in regard to health — as I had always heard and observed that states that wished to be healthy elected a board of health, and also that generals for the sake of their soldiers took physicians out with them, so also when I was appointed to this position, I immediately took thought for this; and I think, he added, that you will fin


1.6.15
529
πρὸς ταῦτα δὴ ὁ πατὴρ εἶπεν ·
Said his father in reply to this,


1.6.16
530
ἀλλ’ , ὦ παῖ , ἔφη , οὗτοι μὲν οὓς λέγεις , ὥσπερ ἱματίων ῥαγέντων εἰσί τινες ἀκεσταί , οὕτω καὶ οἱ ἰατροί , ὅταν τινὲς νοσήσωσι , τότε ἰῶνται τούτους ·
Yes, my son, but just as there are menders of torn garments, so also these physicians whom you mention heal us when we fall sick.


1.6.16
531
σοὶ δὲ τούτου μεγαλοπρεπεστέρα ἔσται ἡ τῆς ὑγιείας ἐπιμέλεια ·
But your responsibility for health will be a larger one than that:


1.6.16
532
τὸ γὰρ ἀρχὴν μὴ κάμνειν τὸ στράτευμα , τούτου σοι δεῖ μέλειν .
you must see to it that your army does not get sick at all.


1.6.16
533
καὶ τίνα δὴ ἐγώ , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , ὁδὸν ἰὼν τοῦτο πράττειν ἱκανὸς ἔσομαι ;
And pray what course shall I take, father, said he, that I may be able to accomplish that?


1.6.16
534
ἢν μὲν δήπου χρόνον τινὰ μέλλῃς ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ μένειν , ὑγιεινοῦ πρῶτον δεῖ στρατοπέδου μὴ ἀμελῆσαι ·
In the first place, if you are going to stay for some time in the same neighbourhood, you must not neglect to find a sanitary location for your camp;


1.6.16
535
τούτου δὲ οὐκ ἂν ἁμάρτοις , ἄνπερ μελήσῃ σοι .
and with proper attention you can not fail in this.


1.6.16
536
καὶ γὰρ λέγοντες οὐδὲν παύονται ἅνθρωποι περί τε τῶν νοσηρῶν χωρίων καὶ περὶ τῶν ὑγιεινῶν ·
For people are continually talking about unhealthful localities and localities that are healthful;


1.6.16
537
μάρτυρες δὲ σαφεῖς ἑκατέροις αὐτῶν παρίστανται τά τε σώματα καὶ τὰ χρώματα .
and you may find clear witnesses to either in the physique and complexion of the inhabitants;


1.6.16
538
ἔπειτα δὲ οὐ τὰ χωρία μόνον ἀρκέσει σκέψασθαι , ἀλλὰ μνήσθητι σὺ πῶς πειρᾷ σαυτοῦ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι ὅπως ὑγιαίνῃς .
and in the second place, it is not enough to have regard to the localities only, but tell me what means you adopt to keep well yourself.


1.6.17
539
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε ·
Cyrus said.


1.6.17
540
πρῶτον μὲν νὴ Δία πειρῶμαι μηδέποτε ὑπερπίμπλασθαι ·
In the first place, by Zeus,  I try never to eat too much,


1.6.17
541
δύσφορον γάρ ·
for that is oppressive;


1.6.17
542
ἔπειτα δὲ ἐκπονῶ τὰ εἰσιόντα ·
and in the second place, I work off by exercise what I have eaten,


1.6.17
543
οὕτω γάρ μοι δοκεῖ ἥ τε ὑγίεια μᾶλλον παραμένειν καὶ ἰσχὺς προσγενέσθαι .
for by so doing health seems more likely to endure and strength to accrue.


1.6.17
544
οὕτω τοίνυν , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , καὶ τῶν ἄλλων δεῖ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
That, then, my son, said he, is the way in which you must take care of the rest also.


1.6.17
545
ἦ καὶ σχολή , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , ἔσται , σωμασκεῖν τοῖς στρατιώταις ;
Yes, father, said he; but will the soldiers find leisure for taking physical exercise?


1.6.17
546
οὐ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ πατήρ , οὐ μόνον γε , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀνάγκη .
Nay, by Zeus, said his father, they not only can, but they actually must.


1.6.17
547
δεῖ γὰρ δήπου στρατιάν , εἰ μέλλει πράξειν τὰ δέοντα , μηδέποτε παύεσθαι ἢ τοῖς πολεμίοις κακὰ πορσύνουσαν ἢ ἑαυτῇ ἀγαθά ·
For if an army is to do its duty, it is absolutely necessary that it never cease to contrive both evil for the enemy and good for itself.


1.6.17
548
ὡς χαλεπὸν μὲν καὶ ἕνα ἄνθρωπον ἀργὸν τρέφεσθαι , πολὺ δ’ ἔτι χαλεπώτερον , ὦ παῖ , οἶκον ὅλον , πάντων δὲ χαλεπώτατον στρατιὰν ἀργὸν τρέφειν .
What a burden it is to support even one idle man! It is more burdensome still to support a whole household in idleness; but the worst burden of all is to support an army in idleness.


1.6.17
549
πλεῖστά τε γὰρ τὰ ἐσθίοντα ἐν στρατιᾷ καὶ ἀπ’ ἐλαχίστων ὁρμώμενα καὶ οἷς ἂν λάβῃ δαψιλέστατα χρώμενα , ὥστε οὔποτε ἀργεῖν δεήσει στρατιάν .
For not only are the mouths in an army very numerous but the supplies they start with are exceedingly limited, and they use up most extravagantly whatever they get, so that an army must never be left idle.


1.6.18
550
λέγεις σύ , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , ὥσπερ οὐδὲ γεωργοῦ ἀργοῦ οὐδὲν ὄφελος , οὕτως οὐδὲ στρατηγοῦ ἀργοῦντος οὐδὲν ὄφελος εἶναι .
Methinks you mean, father, said he, that just as a lazy farmer is of no account, so also a lazy general is of no account at all.


1.6.18
551
τὸν δέ γε ἐργάτην στρατηγὸν ἐγώ , ἔφη , ἀναδέχομαι , ἢν μή τις θεὸς βλάπτῃ , ἅμα καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια μάλιστα ἔχοντας τοὺς στρατιώτας ἀποδείξειν καὶ τὰ σώματα ἄριστα ἔχοντας παρασκευάσειν .
But at any rate, as regards the energetic general, said his father, I can vouch for it that, unless some god do cross him, he will keep his soldiers abundantly supplied with provisions and at the same time in the best physical condition.


1.6.18
552
ἀλλὰ μέντοι , ἔφη , τό γε μελετᾶσθαι ἕκαστα τῶν πολεμικῶν ἔργων , ἀγῶνας ἄν τίς μοι δοκεῖ , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , προειπὼν ἑκάστοις καὶ ἆθλα προτιθεὶς μάλιστ’ ἂν ποιεῖν εὖ ἀσκεῖσθαι ἕκαστα , ὥστε ὁπότε δέοιτο ἔχειν ἂν παρεσκευασμένοις χρῆσθαι .
Yes said Cyrus; but at all events, as to practice in the various warlike exercises, it seems to me, father, that by announcing contests in each one and offering prizes you would best secure practice in them, so that you would have everything prepared for use, whenever you might need it.


1.6.18
553
κάλλιστα λέγεις , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ ·
Quite right, my son, said he;


1.6.18
554
τοῦτο γὰρ ποιήσας , σάφ’ ἴσθι , ὥσπερ χοροὺς τὰς τάξεις ἀεὶ τὰ προσήκοντα μελετώσας θεάσῃ .
for if you do that you may be sure that you will see your companies performing their proper parts like trained sets of dancers.


1.6.19
555
ἀλλὰ μήν , ὁ Κῦρος ἔφη , εἴς γε τὸ προθυμίαν ἐμβαλεῖν στρατιώταις οὐδέν μοι δοκεῖ ἱκανώτερον εἶναι ἢ τὸ δύνασθαι ἐλπίδας ἐμποιεῖν ἀνθρώποις .
In the next place, said Cyrus, for putting enthusiasm into the soldiers nothing seems to be more effectual than the power of inspiring men with hopes.


1.6.19
556
ἀλλ’ , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , τοῦτό γε τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν οἷόνπερ εἴ τις κύνας ἐν θήρᾳ ἀνακαλοῖτο ἀεὶ τῇ κλήσει ᾗπερ ὅταν τὸ θηρίον ὁρᾷ .
Yes, my son, said he; but that is just as if any one on a hunt should always call up his dogs with the call that he uses when he sees the quarry.


1.6.19
557
τὸ μὲν γὰρ πρῶτον προθύμως εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι ἔχει ὑπακουούσας ·
For at first, to be sure, he will find them obeying him eagerly;


1.6.19
558
ἢν δὲ πολλάκις ψεύδηται αὐτάς , τελευτῶσαι οὐδ’ ὁπόταν ἀληθῶς ὁρῶν καλῇ πείθονται αὐτῷ .
but if he deceives them often, in the end they will not obey him when he calls, even though he really does see a wild beast.


1.6.19
559
οὕτω καὶ τὸ περὶ τῶν ἐλπίδων ἔχει ·
So it stands with respect to those hopes also.


1.6.19
560
ἢν πολλάκις προσδοκίας ἀγαθῶν ἐμβαλὼν ψεύδηταί τις , οὐδ’ ὁπόταν ἀληθεῖς ἐλπίδας λέγῃ ὁ τοιοῦτος πείθειν δύναται .
If any one too often raises false expectations of good things to come, eventually he can gain no credence, even when he holds forth well-grounded hopes.


1.6.19
561
ἀλλὰ τοῦ μὲν αὐτὸν λέγειν ἃ μὴ σαφῶς εἰδείη εἴργεσθαι δεῖ , ὦ παῖ , ἄλλοι δ’ ἐνετοὶ λέγοντες ταὔτ’ ἂν διαπράττοιεν ·
But, my son, you should refrain from saying what you are not perfectly sure of; by making certain others your mouthpiece, however, the desired end may be accomplished;


1.6.19
562
τὴν δ’ αὐτοῦ παρακέλευσιν εἰς τοὺς μεγίστους κινδύνους δεῖ ὡς μάλιστα ἐν πίστει διασῴζειν .
but faith in your own words of encouragement you must keep sacred to the utmost to serve you in the greatest crises.


1.6.19
563
ἀλλὰ ναὶ μὰ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὦ πάτερ , καλῶς μοι δοκεῖς λέγειν , καὶ ἐμοὶ οὕτως ἥδιον .
Yes, by Zeus, father, said Cyrus; I think you are right in what you say, and I like your idea better.


1.6.20
564
τό γε μὴν πειθομένους παρέχεσθαι τοὺς στρατιώτας , οὐκ ἀπείρως μοι δοκῶ αὐτοῦ ἔχειν , ὦ πάτερ ·
And then in regard to keeping the soldiers in a state of obedience, I think, father, that I am not inexperienced in that direction;


1.6.20
565
σύ τε γάρ με εὐθὺς τοῦτο ἐκ παιδίου ἐπαίδευες , σαυτῷ πείθεσθαι ἀναγκάζων ·
for you instructed me in obedience from my very childhood on, compelling me to obey you.


1.6.20
566
ἔπειτα τοῖς διδασκάλοις παρέδωκας , καὶ ἐκεῖνοι αὖ τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἔπραττον ·
Then you surrendered me to the charge of my teachers, and they pursued the same course;


1.6.20
567
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐν τοῖς ἐφήβοις ἦμεν , ὁ ἄρχων τοῦ αὐτοῦ τούτου ἰσχυρῶς ἐπεμελεῖτο ·
and when we were in the class of young men, the officer in charge paid especial attention to this same point;


1.6.20
568
καὶ οἱ νόμοι δέ μοι δοκοῦσιν οἱ πολλοὶ ταῦτα δύο μάλιστα διδάσκειν , ἄρχειν τε καὶ ἄρχεσθαι .
and most of the laws seem to me to teach these two things above all else, to govern and to be governed.


1.6.20
569
καὶ τοίνυν κατανοῶν περὶ τούτων ἐν πᾶσιν ὁρᾶν μοι δοκῶ τὸ προτρέπον πείθεσθαι μάλιστα ὂν τὸ τὸν πειθόμενον ἐπαινεῖν τε καὶ τιμᾶν , τὸν δὲ ἀπειθοῦντα ἀτιμάζειν τε καὶ κολάζειν .
And now, when I think of it, it seems to me that in all things the chief incentive to obedience lies in this: praise and honour for the obedient, punishment and dishonour for the disobedient.


1.6.21
570
καὶ ἐπὶ μέν γε τὸ ἀνάγκῃ ἕπεσθαι αὕτη , ὦ παῖ , ἡ ὁδός ἐστιν ·
This, my son, is the road to compulsory obedience, indeed,


1.6.21
571
ἐπὶ δὲ τὸ κρεῖττον τούτου πολύ , τὸ ἑκόντας πείθεσθαι , ἄλλη ἐστὶ συντομωτέρα .
but there is another road, a short cut, to what is much better — namely, to willing obedience.


1.6.21
572
ὃν γὰρ ἂν ἡγήσωνται περὶ τοῦ συμφέροντος ἑαυτοῖς φρονιμώτερον ἑαυτῶν εἶναι , τούτῳ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ὑπερηδέως πείθονται .
For people are only too glad to obey the man who they believe takes wiser thought for their interests than they themselves do.


1.6.21
573
γνοίης δ’ ἂν ὅτι τοῦθ’ οὕτως ἔχει ἐν ἄλλοις τε πολλοῖς καὶ δὴ καὶ ἐν τοῖς κάμνουσιν , ὡς προθύμως τοὺς ἐπιτάξοντας ὅ τι χρὴ ποιεῖν καλοῦσι ·
And you might recognize that this is so in many instances but particularly in the case of the sick: how readily they call in those who are to prescribe what they must do;


1.6.21
574
καὶ ἐν θαλάττῃ δὲ ὡς προθύμως τοῖς κυβερνήταις οἱ συμπλέοντες πείθονται ·
and at sea how cheerfully the passengers obey the captain;


1.6.21
575
καὶ οὕς γ’ ἂν νομίσωσί τινες βέλτιον αὑτῶν ὁδοὺς εἰδέναι , ὡς ἰσχυρῶς τούτων οὐδ’ ἀπολείπεσθαι θέλουσιν .
and how earnestly travellers desire not to get separated from those who they think are better acquainted with the road than they are.


1.6.21
576
ὅταν δὲ οἴωνται πειθόμενοι κακόν τι λήψεσθαι , οὔτε ζημίαις πάνυ τι θέλουσιν εἴκειν οὔτε δώροις ἐπαίρεσθαι .
But when people think that they are going to get into trouble if they obey, they will neither yield very much for punishment nor will they be moved by gifts;


1.6.21
577
οὐδὲ γὰρ δῶρα ἐπὶ τῷ αὑτοῦ κακῷ ἑκὼν οὐδεὶς λαμβάνει .
for no one willingly accepts even a gift at the cost of trouble to himself.


1.6.22
578
λέγεις σύ , ὦ πάτερ , εἰς τὸ πειθομένους ἔχειν οὐδὲν εἶναι ἀνυσιμώτερον τοῦ φρονιμώτερον δοκεῖν εἶναι τῶν ἀρχομένων .
You mean to say, father, that nothing is more effectual toward keeping one’s men obedient than to seem to be wiser than they?


1.6.22
579
λέγω γὰρ οὖν , ἔφη .
Yes, said he, that is just what I mean.


1.6.22
580
καὶ πῶς δή τις ἄν , ὦ πάτερ , τοιαύτην δόξαν τάχιστα περὶ αὑτοῦ παρασχέσθαι δύναιτο ;
And how, pray, father, could one most quickly acquire such a reputation for oneself?


1.6.22
581
οὐκ ἔστιν ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , συντομωτέρα ὁδὸς ἐπὶ τό , περὶ ὧν βούλει , δοκεῖν φρόνιμος εἶναι ἢ τὸ γενέσθαι περὶ τούτων φρόνιμον .
There is no shorter road, my son, said he, than really to be wise in those things in which you wish to seem to be wise;


1.6.22
582
καθ’ ἓν δ’ ἕκαστον σκοπῶν γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ ἀληθῆ λέγω .
and when you examine concrete instances, you will realize that what I say is true.


1.6.22
583
ἢν γὰρ βούλῃ μὴ ὢν ἀγαθὸς γεωργὸς δοκεῖν εἶναι ἀγαθός , ἢ ἱππεὺς ἢ ἰατρὸς ἢ αὐλητὴς ἢ ἄλλ’ ὁτιοῦν , ἐννόει πόσα σε δέοι ἂν μηχανᾶσθαι τοῦ δοκεῖν ἕνεκα .
For example, if you wish to seem to be a good farmer when you are not, or a good rider, doctor, flute-player, or anything else that you are not, just think how many schemes you must invent to keep up your pretensions.


1.6.22
584
καὶ εἰ δὴ πείσαις ἐπαινεῖν τέ σε πολλούς , ὅπως δόξαν λάβοις , καὶ κατασκευὰς καλὰς ἐφ’ ἑκάστῳ αὐτῶν κτήσαιο , ἄρτι τε ἐξηπατηκὼς εἴης ἂν καὶ ὀλίγῳ ὕστερον , ὅπου πεῖραν δοίης , ἐξεληλεγμένος ἂν προσέτι καὶ ἀλαζὼν φαίνοιο .
And even if you should persuade any number of people to praise you, in order to give yourself a reputation, and if you should procure a fine outfit for each of your professions, you would soon be found to have practised deception; and not long after, when you were giving an exhibition of your skill, you would be shown up and convicted, too, as an impostor.


1.6.23
585
φρόνιμος δὲ περὶ τοῦ συνοίσειν μέλλοντος πῶς ἄν τις τῷ ὄντι γένοιτο ;
But how could one become really wise in foreseeing that which will prove to be useful?


1.6.23
586
δῆλον , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , ὅτι ὅσα μὲν ἔστι μαθόντα εἰδέναι , μαθὼν ἄν , ὥσπερ τὰ τακτικὰ ἔμαθες ·
Obviously, my son, said he, by learning all that it is possible to acquire by learning, just as you learned tactics.


1.6.23
587
ὅσα δὲ ἀνθρώποις οὔτε μαθητὰ οὔτε προορατὰ ἀνθρωπίνῃ προνοίᾳ , διὰ μαντικῆς ἂν παρὰ θεῶν πυνθανόμενος φρονιμώτερος ἄλλων εἴης ·
But whatever it is not possible for man to learn, nor for human wisdom to foresee, that you may find out from the gods by the soothsayer’s art, and thus prove yourself wiser than others;


1.6.23
588
ὅ τι δὲ γνοίης βέλτιον ὂν πραχθῆναι , ἐπιμελόμενος ἂν τούτου ὡς ἂν πραχθείη .
and if you know anything that it would be best to have done, you would show yourself wiser than others if you should exert yourself to get that done;


1.6.23
589
καὶ γὰρ τὸ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι οὗ ἂν δέῃ φρονιμωτέρου ἀνδρὸς ἢ τὸ ἀμελεῖν .
for it is a mark of greater wisdom in a man to strive to secure what is needful than to neglect it.


1.6.24
590
ἀλλὰ μέντοι ἐπὶ τὸ φιλεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχομένων , ὅπερ ἔμοιγε ἐν τοῖς μεγίστοις δοκεῖ εἶναι , δῆλον ὅτι ἡ αὐτὴ ὁδὸς ἥπερ εἴ τις ὑπὸ τῶν φίλων στέργεσθαι ἐπιθυμοίη ·
Yes; but as to the love of one’s subjects — and this, it seems to me at least, is one of the most important questions — the same course that you would take if you wished to gain the affection of your friends leads also to that;


1.6.24
591
εὖ γὰρ οἶμαι δεῖν ποιοῦντα φανερὸν εἶναι .
that is, I think, you must show yourself to be their benefactor.


1.6.24
592
ἀλλὰ τοῦτο μέν , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , χαλεπὸν τὸ ἀεὶ δύνασθαι εὖ ποιεῖν οὓς ἄν τις ἐθέλῃ ·
Yes, my son, said he; it is a difficult matter, however, always to be in a position to do good to whom you will;


1.6.24
593
τὸ δὲ συνηδόμενόν τε φαίνεσθαι , ἤν τι ἀγαθὸν αὐτοῖς συμβαίνῃ , καὶ συναχθόμενον , ἤν τι κακόν , καὶ συνεπικουρεῖν προθυμούμενον ταῖς ἀπορίαις αὐτῶν , καὶ φοβούμενον μή τι σφαλῶσι , καὶ προνοεῖν πειρώμενον ὡς μὴ σφάλλωνται , ταῦτά πως δεῖ μᾶλλον συμπαρομαρτεῖν .
but to show that you rejoice with them if any good befall them, that you sympathize with them if any ill betide, that you are eager to help them in times of distress, that you are anxious that they be not crossed in any way, and that you try to prevent their being crossed; it is in these respects somehow that you ought rather to go hand in hand with them.


1.6.25
594
καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν πράξεων δέ , ἢν μὲν ἐν θέρει ὦσι , τὸν ἄρχοντα δεῖ τοῦ ἡλίου πλεονεκτοῦντα φανερὸν εἶναι ·
And in his campaigns also, if they fall in the summer time, the general must show that he can endure the heat of the sun better than his soldiers can,


1.6.25
595
ἢν δὲ ἐν χειμῶνι , τοῦ ψύχους ·
and that he can endure cold better than they if it be in winter;


1.6.25
596
ἢν δὲ διὰ μόχθων , τῶν πόνων ·
if the way lead through difficulties, that he can endure hardships better.


1.6.25
597
πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα εἰς τὸ φιλεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχομένων συλλαμβάνει .
All this contributes to his being loved by his men.


1.6.25
598
λέγεις σύ , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , ὡς καὶ καρτερώτερον δεῖ πρὸς πάντα τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν ἀρχομένων εἶναι .
You mean to say, father, said he, that in everything the general must show more endurance than his men.


1.6.25
599
λέγω γὰρ οὖν , ἔφη .
Yes, said he, that is just what I mean;


1.6.25
600
θάρρει μέντοι τοῦτο , ὦ παῖ ·
however, never fear for that, my son;


1.6.25
601
εὖ γὰρ ἴσθι ὅτι τῶν ὁμοίων σωμάτων οἱ αὐτοὶ πόνοι οὐχ ὁμοίως ἅπτονται ἄρχοντός τε ἀνδρὸς καὶ ἰδιώτου , ἀλλ’ ἐπικουφίζει τι ἡ τιμὴ τοὺς πόνους τῷ ἄρχοντι καὶ αὐτὸ τὸ εἰδέναι ὅτι οὐ λανθάνει ὅ τι ἂν ποιῇ .
for bear in mind that the same toils do not affect the general and the private in the same way, though they have the same sort of bodies; but the honour of the general’s position and the very consciousness that nothing he does escapes notice lighten the burdens for him.


1.6.26
602
ὁπότε δέ , ὦ πάτερ , σοι ἤδη ἔχοιεν μὲν τὰ ἐπιτήδεια οἱ στρατιῶται , ὑγιαίνοιεν δέ , πονεῖν δὲ δύναιντο , τὰς δὲ πολεμικὰς τέχνας ἠσκηκότες εἶεν , φιλοτίμως δ’ ἔχοιεν πρὸς τὸ ἀγαθοὶ φαίνεσθαι , τὸ δὲ πείθεσθαι αὐτοῖς ἥδιον εἴη τοῦ ἀπειθεῖν , οὐκ ἂν τηνικαῦτα σωφρονεῖν ἄν τίς σοι δοκοίη διαγωνίζεσθαι βουλόμενος πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους ὡς τάχιστα ;
But, father, when once your soldiers had supplies and were well and able to endure toils, and when they were practised in the arts of war and ambitious to prove themselves brave, and when they were more inclined to obey than to disobey, under such circumstances do you not think it would be wise to desire to engage the enemy at the very first opportunity?


1.6.26
603
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , εἰ μέλλοι γε πλέον ἕξειν ·
Yes, by Zeus, said he; at any rate, if I expected to gain some advantage by it;


1.6.26
604
εἰ δὲ μή , ἔγωγ’ ἂν ὅσῳ οἰοίμην καὶ αὐτὸς βελτίων εἶναι καὶ τοὺς ἑπομένους βελτίονας ἔχειν , τόσῳ ἂν μᾶλλον φυλαττοίμην , ὥσπερ καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἃ ἂν οἰώμεθα πλείστου ἡμῖν ἄξια εἶναι , ταῦτα πειρώμεθα ὡς ἐν ἐχυρωτάτῳ ποιεῖσθαι .
otherwise, for my part, the better I thought myself to be and the better my followers, the more should I be on my guard, just as we try to keep other things also which we hold most precious in the greatest possible security.


1.6.27
605
πλέον δ’ ἔχειν , ὦ πάτερ , πολεμίων πῶς ἄν τις δύναιτο μάλιστα ;
But, father, what would be the best way to gain an advantage over the enemy?


1.6.27
606
οὐ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐκέτι τοῦτο φαῦλον , ὦ παῖ , οὐδ’ ἁπλοῦν ἔργον ἐρωτᾷς ·
By Zeus, said he, this is no easy or simple question that you ask now, my son;


1.6.27
607
ἀλλ’ εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι δεῖ τὸν μέλλοντα τοῦτο ποιήσειν καὶ ἐπίβουλον εἶναι καὶ κρυψίνουν καὶ δολερὸν καὶ ἀπατεῶνα καὶ κλέπτην καὶ ἅρπαγα καὶ ἐν παντὶ πλεονέκτην τῶν πολεμίων .
but, let me tell you, the man who proposes to do that must be designing and cunning, wily and deceitful, a thief and a robber, overreaching the enemy at every point.


1.6.27
608
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἐπιγελάσας εἶπεν ·
And Cyrus, with a laugh, said,


1.6.27
609
ὦ Ἡράκλεις , οἷον σὺ λέγεις , ὦ πάτερ , δεῖν ἄνδρα με γενέσθαι .
O Heracles, father, what a man you say I must become!


1.6.27
610
οἷος ἂν ὤν , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , δικαιότατός τε καὶ νομιμώτατος ἀνὴρ εἴης .
Such, my son, he said, that you would be at the same time the most righteous and law-abiding man in the world.


1.6.28
611
πῶς μήν , ἔφη , παῖδας ὄντας ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐφήβους τ- ἐναντία τούτων ἐδιδάσκετε ;
Why then, pray, did you use to teach us the opposite of this when we were boys and youths?


1.6.28
612
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , καὶ νῦν πρὸς τοὺς φίλους τε καὶ πολίτας ·
Aye, by Zeus, said he; and so we would have you still towards your friends and fellow-citizens;


1.6.28
613
ὅπως δέ γε τοὺς πολεμίους δύναισθε κακῶς ποιεῖν οὐκ οἶσθα μανθάνοντας ὑμᾶς πολλὰς κακουργίας ;
but, that you might be able to hurt your enemies, do you not know that you all were learning many villainies?


1.6.28
614
οὐ δῆτα , ἔφη , ἔγωγε , ὦ πάτερ .
No, indeed, father, said he; not I, at any rate.


1.6.28
615
τίνος μὴν ἕνεκα , ἔφη , ἐμανθάνετε τοξεύειν ;
Why, said he, did you learn to shoot,


1.6.28
616
τίνος δ’ ἕνεκα ἀκοντίζειν ;
and why to throw the spear?


1.6.28
617
τίνος δ’ ἕνεκα δολοῦν ὗς ἀγρίους καὶ πλέγμασι καὶ ὀρύγμασι ;
Why did you learn to ensnare wild boars with nets and pitfalls,


1.6.28
618
τί δ’ ἐλάφους ποδάγραις καὶ ἁρπεδόναις ;
and deer with traps and toils?


1.6.28
619
τί δὲ λέουσι καὶ ἄρκτοις καὶ παρδάλεσιν οὐκ εἰς τὸ ἴσον καθιστάμενοι ἐμάχεσθε , ἀλλὰ μετὰ πλεονεξίας τινὸς αἰεὶ ἐπειρᾶσθε ἀγωνίζεσθαι πρὸς αὐτά ;
And why were you not used to confront lions and bears and leopards in a fair fight face to face instead of always trying to contend against them with some advantage on your side?


1.6.28
620
ἢ οὐ πάντα γιγνώσκεις ταῦτα ὅτι κακουργίαι τέ εἰσι καὶ ἀπάται καὶ δολώσεις καὶ πλεονεξίαι ;
Why, do you not know that all this is villainy and deceit and trickery and taking unfair advantage?


1.6.29
621
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , θηρίων γε ·
Yes, by Zeus, said he, toward wild animals however;


1.6.29
622
ἀνθρώπων δὲ εἰ καὶ δόξαιμι βούλεσθαι ἐξαπατῆσαί τινα , πολλὰς πληγὰς οἶδα λαμβάνων .
but if I ever even seemed to wish to deceive a man, I know that I got a good beating for it.


1.6.29
623
οὐδὲ γὰρ τοξεύειν , οἶμαι , οὐδ’ ἀκοντίζειν ἄνθρωπον ἐπετρέπομεν ὑμῖν , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ σκοπὸν βάλλειν ἐδιδάσκομεν , ἵνα γε νῦν μὲν μὴ κακουργοίητε τοὺς φίλους , εἰ δέ ποτε πόλεμος γένοιτο , δύναισθε καὶ ἀνθρώπων στοχάζεσθαι ·
Yes, said he; for, methinks, we did not permit you to shoot at people nor to throw your spear at them; but we taught you to shoot at a mark, in order that you might not for the time at least do harm to your friends, but, in case there should ever be a war, that you might be able to aim well at men also.


1.6.29
624
καὶ ἐξαπατᾶν δὲ καὶ πλεονεκτεῖν οὐκ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἐπαιδεύομεν ὑμᾶς , ἀλλ’ ἐν θηρίοις , ἵνα μηδ’ ἐν τούτοις τοὺς φίλους βλάπτοιτε , εἰ δέ ποτε πόλεμος γένοιτο , μηδὲ τούτων ἀγύμναστοι εἴητε .
And we instructed you likewise to deceive and to take advantage, not in the case of men but of beasts, in order that you might not injure your friends by so doing, but, if there should ever be a war, that you might not be unpractised in these arts.


1.6.30
625
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , ὦ πάτερ , εἴπερ χρήσιμά ἐστιν ἀμφότερα ἐπίστασθαι , εὖ τε ποιεῖν καὶ κακῶς ἀνθρώπους , καὶ διδάσκειν ἀμφότερα ταῦτα ἔδει ἐν ἀνθρώποις .
Well then, father,  said he,  if indeed it is useful to understand both how to do good and how to do evil to men, we ought to have been taught both these branches in the case of men, too.


1.6.31
626
ἀλλὰ λέγεται , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , ἐπὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων προγόνων γενέσθαι ποτὲ ἀνὴρ διδάσκαλος τῶν παίδων , ὃς ἐδίδασκεν ἄρα τοὺς παῖδας τὴν δικαιοσύνην , ὥσπερ σὺ κελεύεις , μὴ ψεύδεσθαι καὶ ψεύδεσθαι , καὶ μὴ ἐξαπατᾶν καὶ ἐξαπατᾶν , καὶ μὴ διαβάλλειν καὶ διαβάλλειν , καὶ μὴ πλεονεκτεῖν καὶ πλεονεκτεῖν .
Yes, my son, said he; it is said that in the time of our forefathers there was once a teacher of the boys who, it seems, used to teach them justice in the very way that you propose; to lie and not to lie, to cheat and not to cheat, to slander and not to slander, to take and not to take unfair advantage.


1.6.31
627
διώριζε δὲ τούτων ἅ τε πρὸς τοὺς φίλους ποιητέον καὶ ἃ πρὸς ἐχθρούς .
And he drew the line between what one should do to one’s friends and what to one’s enemies.


1.6.31
628
καὶ ἔτι γε ταῦτα ἐδίδασκεν ὡς καὶ τοὺς φίλους δίκαιον εἴη ἐξαπατᾶν ἐπί γε ἀγαθῷ , καὶ κλέπτειν τὰ τῶν φίλων ἐπὶ ἀγαθῷ .
And what is more, he used to teach this: that it was right to deceive friends even, provided it were for a good end, and to steal the possessions of a friend for a good purpose.


1.6.32
629
ταῦτα δὲ διδάσκοντα ἀνάγκη καὶ γυμνάζειν ἦν πρὸς ἀλλήλους τοὺς παῖδας ταῦτα ποιεῖν , ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν πάλῃ φασὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας διδάσκειν ἐξαπατᾶν , καὶ γυμνάζειν δὲ τοὺς παῖδας πρὸς ἀλλήλους τοῦτο δύνασθαι ποιεῖν .
And in teaching these lessons he had also to train the boys to practise them upon one another, just as also in wrestling, the Greeks, they say, teach deception and train the boys to be able to practise it upon one another.


1.6.32
630
γενόμενοι οὖν τινες οὕτως εὐφυεῖς καὶ πρὸς τὸ εὖ ἐξαπατᾶν καὶ πρὸς τὸ εὖ πλεονεκτεῖν , ἴσως δὲ καὶ πρὸς τὸ φιλοκερδεῖν οὐκ ἀφυεῖς ὄντες , οὐκ ἀπείχοντο οὐδ’ ἀπὸ τῶν φίλων τὸ μὴ οὐ πλεονεκτεῖν αὐτῶν πειρᾶσθαι .
When, therefore, some had in this way become expert both in deceiving successfully and in taking unfair advantage and perhaps also not inexpert in avarice, they did not refrain from trying to take an unfair advantage even of their friends.


1.6.33
631
ἐγένετο οὖν ἐκ τούτων ῥήτρα , ᾗ καὶ νῦν χρώμεθα ἔτι , ἁπλῶς διδάσκειν τοὺς παῖδας ὥσπερ τοὺς οἰκέτας πρὸς ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς διδάσκομεν ἀληθεύειν καὶ μὴ ἐξαπατᾶν καὶ μὴ πλεονεκτεῖν ·
In consequence of that, therefore, an ordinance was passed which obtains even unto this day, simply to teach our boys, just as we teach our servants in their relations toward us, to tell the truth and not to deceive and not to take unfair advantage;


1.6.33
632
εἰ δὲ παρὰ ταῦτα ποιοῖεν , κολάζειν , ὅπως σὺν τοιούτῳ ἔθει ἐθισθέντες πρᾳότεροι πολῖται γένοιντο .
and if they should act contrary to this law, the law requires their punishment, in order that, inured to such habits, they may become more refined members of society.


1.6.34
633
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἔχοιεν τὴν ἡλικίαν ἣν σὺ νῦν ἔχεις , ἤδη καὶ τὰ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους νόμιμα ἐδόκει ἀσφαλὲς εἶναι διδάσκειν .
But when they came to be as old as you are now, then it seemed to be safe to teach them that also which is lawful toward enemies;


1.6.34
634
οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἔτι ἐξενεχθῆναι δοκεῖτε πρὸς τὸ ἄγριοι πολῖται γενέσθαι ἐν τῷ αἰδεῖσθαι ἀλλήλους συντεθραμμένοι ·
for it does not seem likely that you would break away and degenerate into savages after you had been brought up together in mutual respect.


1.6.34
635
ὥσπερ γε καὶ περὶ ἀφροδισίων οὐ διελεγόμεθα πρὸς τοὺς ἄγαν νέους , ἵνα μὴ πρὸς τὴν ἰσχυρὰν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτοῖς ῥᾳδιουργίας προσγενομένης ἀμέτρως αὐτῇ χρῷντο οἱ νέοι .
In the same way we do not discuss sexual matters in the presence of very young boys, lest in case lax discipline should give a free rein to their passions the young might indulge them to excess.


1.6.35
636
νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη ·
True, by Zeus, said he;


1.6.35
637
ὡς τοίνυν ὀψιμαθῆ ὄντα ἐμὲ τούτων τῶν πλεονεξιῶν , ὦ πάτερ , μὴ φείδου εἴ τι ἔχεις διδάσκειν ὅπως πλεονεκτήσω ἐγὼ τῶν πολεμίων .
but seeing that I am late in learning about this art of taking advantage of others, do not neglect to teach me, father, if you can, how I may take advantage of the enemy.


1.6.35
638
μηχανῶ τοίνυν , ἔφη , ὅπως ἐς τὴν δύναμιν τεταγμένοις τε τοῖς σαυτοῦ ἀτάκτους λαμβάνῃς τοὺς πολεμίους καὶ ὡπλισμένοις ἀόπλους καὶ ἐγρηγορόσι καθεύδοντας , καὶ φανερούς σοι ὄντας ἀφανὴς αὐτὸς ὢν ἐκείνοις καὶ ἐν δυσχωρίᾳ αὐτοὺς γιγνομένους ἐν ἐρυμνῷ αὐτὸς ὢν ὑποδέξῃ .
Contrive, then, said he, as far as is in your power, with your own men in good order to catch the enemy in disorder, with your own men armed to come upon them unarmed, and with your own men awake to surprise them sleeping, and then you will catch them in an unfavourable position while you yourself are in a strong position, when they are in sight to you and while you yourself are unseen.


1.6.36
639
καὶ πῶς ἄν , ἔφη , τις τοιαῦτα , ὦ πάτερ , ἁμαρτάνοντας δύναιτ’ ἂν τοὺς πολεμίους λαμβάνειν ;
And how, father, said he, could one catch the enemy making such mistakes?


1.6.36
640
ὅτι , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , πολλὰ μὲν τούτων ἀνάγκη ἐστὶ καὶ ὑμᾶς καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους παρασχεῖν ·
Why, my son, said he, both you and the enemy must necessarily offer many such opportunities;


1.6.36
641
σιτοποιεῖσθαί τε γὰρ ἀνάγκη ἀμφοτέρους , κοιμᾶσθαί τε ἀνάγκη ἀμφοτέρους καὶ ἕωθεν ἐπὶ τὰ ἀναγκαῖα σχεδὸν ἅμα πάντας ἵεσθαι , καὶ ταῖς ὁδοῖς ὁποῖαι ἂν ὦσι τοιαύταις ἀνάγκη χρῆσθαι .
for instance, you must both eat, and you must both sleep, and early in the morning you must almost all at the same time attend to the calls of nature, and you must make use of such roads as you find.


1.6.36
642
ἃ χρή σε πάντα κατανοοῦντα , ἐν ᾧ μὲν ἂν ὑμᾶς γιγνώσκῃς ἀσθενεστάτους γιγνομένους , ἐν τούτῳ μάλιστα φυλάττεσθαι ·
All this you must observe, and you must be particularly watchful on the side where you know yourselves to be weaker,


1.6.36
643
ἐν ᾧ δ’ ἂν τοὺς πολεμίους αἰσθάνῃ εὐχειρωτοτάτους γιγνομένους , ἐν τούτῳ μάλιστα ἐπιτίθεσθαι .
and you must attack the enemy above all in that quarter in which you see that they are most vulnerable.


1.6.37
644
πότερον δ’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ἐν τούτοις μόνον ἔστι πλεονεκτεῖν ἢ καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις τισί ;
And is it possible to take advantage in these ways only, said Cyrus, or in other ways also?


1.6.37
645
καὶ πολύ γε μᾶλλον , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ ·
Aye, far more in other ways, my son, said he;


1.6.37
646
ἐν τούτοις μὲν γὰρ ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ πάντες ἰσχυρὰς φυλακὰς ποιοῦνται εἰδότες ὅτι δέονται .
for in these particulars all men, as a rule, take strict precautions; for they know that they must.


1.6.37
647
οἱ δ’ ἐξαπατῶντες τοὺς πολεμίους δύνανται καὶ θαρρῆσαι ποιήσαντες ἀφυλάκτους λαμβάνειν καὶ διῶξαι παραδόντες ἑαυτοὺς ἀτάκτους ποιῆσαι καὶ εἰς δυσχωρίαν φυγῇ ὑπαγαγόντες ἐνταῦθα ἐπιτίθεσθαι .
But those whose business it is to deceive the enemy can catch them off their guard by inspiring them with over-confidence; and, by offering them the opportunity of pursuit, can get them into disorder; and, by leading them on into unfavourable ground by pretended flight, can there turn and attack them.


1.6.38
648
δεῖ δή , ἔφη , φιλομαθῆ σε τούτων ἁπάντων ὄντα οὐχ οἷς ἂν μάθῃς τούτοις μόνοις χρῆσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸν ποιητὴν εἶναι τῶν πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους μηχανημάτων , ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ μουσικοὶ οὐχ οἷς ἂν μάθωσι τούτοις μόνον χρῶνται , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλλα νέα πειρῶνται ποιεῖν .
However, my son, he continued, since you are desirous of learning all these matters, you must not only utilize what you may learn from others, but you must yourself also be an inventor of stratagems against the enemy, just as musicians render not only those compositions which they have learned but try to compose others also that are new.


1.6.38
649
καὶ σφόδρα μὲν καὶ ἐν τοῖς μουσικοῖς τὰ νέα καὶ ἀνθηρὰ εὐδοκιμεῖ , πολὺ δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς πολεμικοῖς μᾶλλον τὰ καινὰ μηχανήματα εὐδοκιμεῖ ·
Now if in music that which is new and fresh wins applause, new stratagems in warfare also win far greater applause,


1.6.38
650
ταῦτα γὰρ μᾶλλον καὶ ἐξαπατᾶν δύναται τοὺς ὑπεναντίους .
for such can deceive the enemy even more successfully.


1.6.39
651
εἰ δὲ σύ γε , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , μηδὲν ἄλλο ἢ μετενέγκοις ἐπ’ ἀνθρώπους τὰς μηχανὰς ἃς καὶ πάνυ ἐπὶ τοῖς μικροῖς θηρίοις ἐμηχανῶ , οὐκ οἴει ἄν , ἔφη , πρόσω πάνυ ἐλάσαι τῆς πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους πλεονεξίας ;
And if you, my son, he went on, should do nothing more than apply to your dealings with men the tricks that you used to practise so constantly in dealing with small game, do you not think that you would make a very considerable advance in the art of taking advantage of the enemy?


1.6.39
652
σὺ γὰρ ἐπὶ μὲν τὰς ὄρνιθας ἐν τῷ ἰσχυροτάτῳ χειμῶνι ἀνιστάμενος ἐπορεύου νυκτός , καὶ πρὶν κινεῖσθαι τὰς ὄρνιθας ἐπεποίηντό σοι αἱ πάγαι αὐταῖς καὶ τὸ κεκινημένον χωρίον ἐξείκαστο τῷ ἀκινήτῳ ·
For you used to get up in the coldest winter weather and go out before daylight to catch birds, and before the birds were astir you had your snares laid ready for them and the ground disturbed had been made exactly like the ground undisturbed;


1.6.39
653
ὄρνιθες δ’ ἐπεπαίδευντό σοι ὥστε σοὶ μὲν τὰ συμφέροντα ὑπηρετεῖν , τὰς δὲ ὁμοφύλους ὄρνιθας ἐξαπατᾶν ·
and your decoy birds had been so trained as to serve your purposes and to deceive the birds of the same species,


1.6.39
654
αὐτὸς δὲ ἐνήδρευες , ὥστε ὁρᾶν μὲν αὐτάς , μὴ ὁρᾶσθαι δὲ ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ·
while you yourself would lie in hiding so as to see them but not to be seen by them;


1.6.39
655
ἠσκήκεις δὲ φθάνων ἕλκειν ἢ τὰ πτηνὰ φεύγειν .
and you had practised drawing your nets before the birds could escape.


1.6.40
656
πρὸς δ’ αὖ τὸν λαγῶ , ὅτι μὲν ἐν σκότει νέμεται , τὴν δ’ ἡμέραν ἀποδιδράσκει , κύνας ἔτρεφες αἳ τῇ ὀσμῇ αὐτὸν ἀνηύρισκον .
And again, to catch the hare — because he feeds in the night and hides in the daytime — you used to breed dogs that would find him out by the scent.


1.6.40
657
ὅτι δὲ ταχὺ ἔφευγεν , ἐπεὶ εὑρεθείη , ἄλλας κύνας εἶχες ἐπιτετηδευμένας πρὸς τὸ κατὰ πόδας αἱρεῖν .
And because he ran so fast, when he was found, you used to have other dogs trained to catch him by coursing.


1.6.40
658
εἰ δὲ καὶ ταύτας ἀποφύγοι , τοὺς πόρους αὐτῶν ἐκμανθάνων καὶ πρὸς οἷα χωρία φεύγοντες ἀφικνοῦνται οἱ λαγῷ , ἐν τούτοις δίκτυα δυσόρατα ἐνεπετάννυες ἄν , καὶ τῷ σφόδρα φεύγειν αὐτὸς ἑαυτὸν ἐμπεσὼν συνέδει .
And in case he escaped even these, you used to find out the runs and the places where hares take refuge and may be caught, and there you would spread out your nets so as to be hardly visible, and the hare in his headlong flight would plunge into them and entangle himself.


1.6.40
659
τοῦ δὲ μηδ’ ἐντεῦθεν διαφεύγειν σκοποὺς τοῦ γιγνομένου καθίστης , οἳ ἐγγύθεν ταχὺ ἔμελλον ἐπιγενήσεσθαι ·
And lest he escape even from that, you used to station men to watch for what might happen and to pounce upon him suddenly from a place near by.


1.6.40
660
καὶ αὐτὸς μὲν σὺ ὄπισθεν κραυγῇ οὐδὲν ὑστεριζούσῃ τοῦ λαγῶ βοῶν ἐξέπληττες αὐτὸν ὥστε ἄφρονα ἁλίσκεσθαι , τοὺς δ’ ἔμπροσθεν σιγᾶν διδάξας ἐνεδρεύοντας λανθάνειν ἐποίεις .
And you yourself from behind shouting with a cry that kept right up with the hare would frighten him so that he would lose his wits and be taken; those in front, on the other hand, you had instructed to keep silent and made them lie concealed in ambush.


1.6.41
661
ὥσπερ οὖν προεῖπον , εἰ τοιαῦτα ἐθελήσαις καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις μηχανᾶσθαι , οὐκ οἶδ’ ἔγωγε εἴ τινος λείποιο ἂν τῶν πολεμίων .
As I said before, then, if you would employ such schemes on men also, I am inclined to think that you would not come short of any enemy in the world.


1.6.41
662
ἢν δέ ποτε ἄρα ἀνάγκη γένηται καὶ ἐν τῷ ἰσοπέδῳ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἐμφανοῦς καὶ ὡπλισμένους ἀμφοτέρους μάχην συνάπτειν , ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ δή , ὦ παῖ , αἱ ἐκ πολλοῦ παρεσκευασμέναι πλεονεξίαι μέγα δύνανται .
But if it is ever necessary — as it may well be — to join battle in the open field, in plain sight, with both armies in full array, why, in such a case, my son, the advantages that have been long since secured are of much avail;


1.6.41
663
ταύτας δὲ ἐγὼ λέγω εἶναι , ἢν τῶν στρατιωτῶν εὖ μὲν τὰ σώματα ἠσκημένα ᾖ , εὖ δὲ αἱ ψυχαὶ τεθηγμέναι , εὖ δὲ αἱ πολεμικαὶ τέχναι μεμελετημέναι ὦσιν .
by that I mean, if your soldiers are physically in good training, if their hearts are well steeled and the arts of war well studied.


1.6.42
664
εὖ δὲ χρὴ καὶ τοῦτο εἰδέναι ὅτι ὁπόσους ἂν ἀξιοῖς σοι πείθεσθαι , καὶ ἐκεῖνοι πάντες ἀξιώσουσι σὲ πρὸ ἑαυτῶν βουλεύεσθαι .
Besides, you must remember well that all those from whom you expect obedience to you will, on their part, expect you to take thought for them.


1.6.42
665
μηδέποτ’ οὖν ἀφροντίστως ἔχε , ἀλλὰ τῆς μὲν νυκτὸς προσκόπει τί σοι ποιήσουσιν οἱ ἀρχόμενοι , ἐπειδὰν ἡμέρα γένηται , τῆς δ’ ἡμέρας ὅπως τὰ εἰς νύκτα κάλλιστα ἕξει .
So never be careless, but think out at night what your men are to do for you when day comes, and in the daytime think out how the arrangements for the night may best be made.


1.6.43
666
ὅπως δὲ χρὴ τάττειν εἰς μάχην στρατιὰν ἢ ὅπως ἄγειν ἡμέρας ἢ νυκτὸς ἢ στενὰς ἢ πλατείας ὁδοὺς ἢ ὀρεινὰς ἢ πεδινάς , ἢ ὅπως στρατοπεδεύεσθαι , ἢ ὅπως φυλακὰς νυκτερινὰς καὶ ἡμερινὰς καθιστάναι , ἢ ὅπως προσάγειν πρὸς πολεμίους ἢ ἀπάγειν ἀπὸ πολεμίων , ἢ ὅπως παρὰ πόλιν πολεμίαν ἄγειν ἢ ὅπως πρὸς τεῖχος ἄγειν ἢ ἀπάγειν , ἢ ὅπως νάπη ἢ ποταμοὺς διαβαίνειν , ἢ ὅπως ἱππικὸν φυλάττεσθαι ἢ ὅπως ἀκοντιστὰς ἢ τοξότας , καὶ εἴ γε δή σοι κατὰ κέρας ἄγοντι οἱ πολέμιοι ἐπιφανεῖεν , πῶς χρὴ ἀντικαθιστάναι , καὶ εἴ σοι ἐπὶ φάλαγγος ἄγοντι ἄλλοθέν ποθεν οἱ πολέμιοι φαίνοιντο ἢ κατὰ πρόσωπον , ὅπως χρὴ ἀντιπαράγειν , ἢ ὅπως τὰ τῶν πολεμίων ἄν τις μάλιστα αἰσθάνοιτο , ἢ ὅπως τὰ σὰ οἱ πολέμιοι ἥκιστα εἰδεῖεν , ταῦτα δὲ πάντα τί ἂν ἐγὼ λέγοιμί σοι ;
But how you ought to draw up an army in battle array, or how you ought to lead it by day or by night, by narrow ways or broad, over mountains or plains, or how you should pitch camp, or how station your sentinels by night or by day, or how you should advance against the enemy or retreat before them, or how you should lead past a hostile city, or how attack a fortification or withdraw from it, or how you should cross ravines or rivers, or how you should protect yourself against cavalry or spearmen or bowmen, and if the enemy should suddenly come in sight while you are leading on in column, how you should form and take your stand against them, and if they should come in sight from any other quarter than in front as you are marching in phalanx, how you should form and face them, or how any one might best find out the enemy’s plans or how the enemy might be least likely to learn his — why should I tell you all these things?


1.6.43
667
ὅσα τε γὰρ ἔγωγε ᾔδειν , πολλάκις ἀκήκοας , ἄλλος τε ὅστις ἐδόκει τι τούτων ἐπίστασθαι , οὐδενὸς αὐτῶν ἠμέληκας οὐδ’ ἀδαὴς γεγένησαι .
For what I, for my part, know, you have often heard; and if any one else had a reputation for understanding anything of that kind, you never neglected to get information from him, nor have you been uninstructed.


1.6.43
668
δεῖ οὖν πρὸς τὰ συμβαίνοντα , οἶμαι , τούτοις χρῆσθαι ὁποῖον ἂν συμφέρειν σοι τούτων δοκῇ .
I think, then, that you should turn this knowledge to account according to circumstances, as each item of it may appear serviceable to you.


1.6.44
669
μάθε δέ μου καὶ τάδε , ἔφη , ὦ παῖ , τὰ μέγιστα ·
Learn this lesson, too, from me, my son, said he; it is the most important thing of all:


1.6.44
670
παρὰ γὰρ ἱερὰ καὶ οἰωνοὺς μήτε σαυτῷ μηδέποτε μήτε στρατιᾷ κινδυνεύσῃς , κατανοῶν ὡς ἄνθρωποι μὲν αἱροῦνται πράξεις εἰκάζοντες , εἰδότες δὲ οὐδὲν ἀπὸ ποίας ἔσται αὐτοῖς τὰ ἀγαθά .
never go into any danger either to yourself or to your army contrary to the omens or the auspices, and bear in mind that men choose lines of action by conjecture and do not know in the least from which of them success will come.


1.6.45
671
γνοίης δ’ ἂν ἐξ αὐτῶν τῶν γιγνομένων ·
But you may derive this lesson from the facts of history;


1.6.45
672
πολλοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἤδη πόλεις ἔπεισαν καὶ ταῦτα οἱ δοκοῦντες σοφώτατοι εἶναι πόλεμον ἄρασθαι πρὸς τούτους ὑφ’ ὧν οἱ πεισθέντες ἐπιθέσθαι ἀπώλοντο , πολλοὶ δὲ πολλοὺς ηὔξησαν καὶ ἰδιώτας καὶ πόλεις ὑφ’ ὧν αὐξηθέντων τὰ μέγιστα κακὰ ἔπαθον , πολλοὶ δὲ οἷς ἐξῆν φίλοις χρῆσθαι καὶ εὖ ποιεῖν καὶ εὖ πάσχειν , τούτοις δούλοις μᾶλλον βουληθέντες ἢ φίλοις χρῆσθαι , ὑπ’ αὐτῶν τούτων δίκην ἔδοσαν ·
for many, and men, too, who seemed most wise, have ere now persuaded states to take up arms against others, and the states thus persuaded to attack have been destroyed. And many have made many others great, both individuals and states; and when they have exalted them, they have suffered the most grievous wrongs at their hands. And many who might have treated people as friends and done them favours and received favours from them, have received their just deserts from these very people because they preferred to treat them like slaves rather than as friends.


1.6.45
673
πολλοῖς δ’ οὐκ ἤρκεσεν αὐτοῖς τὸ μέρος ἔχουσι ζῆν ἡδέως , ἐπιθυμήσαντες δὲ πάντων κύριοι εἶναι , διὰ ταῦτα καὶ ὧν εἶχον ἀπέτυχον ·
Many, too, not satisfied to live contentedly in the enjoyment of their own proper share, have lost even that which they had, because they have desired to be lords of everything;


1.6.45
674
πολλοὶ δὲ τὸν πολύευκτον πλοῦτον κατακτησάμενοι , διὰ τοῦτον ἀπώλοντο .
and many, when they have gained the much coveted wealth, have been ruined by it.


1.6.46
675
οὕτως ἡ ἀνθρωπίνη σοφία οὐδὲν μᾶλλον οἶδε τὸ ἄριστον αἱρεῖσθαι ἢ εἰ κληρούμενος ὅ τι λάχοι τοῦτό τις πράττοι .
So we see that mere human wisdom does not know how to choose what is best any more than if any one were to cast lots and do as the lot fell.


1.6.46
676
θεοὶ δέ , ὦ παῖ , αἰεὶ ὄντες πάντα ἴσασι τά τε γεγενημένα καὶ τὰ ὄντα καὶ ὅ τι ἐξ ἑκάστου αὐτῶν ἀποβήσεται , καὶ τῶν συμβουλευομένων ἀνθρώπων οἷς ἂν ἵλεῳ ὦσι , προσημαίνουσιν ἅ τε χρὴ ποιεῖν καὶ ἃ οὐ χρή .
But the gods, my son, the eternal gods, know all things, both what has been and what is and what shall come to pass as a result of each present or past event; and if men consult them, they reveal to those to whom they are propitious what they ought to do and what they ought not to do.


1.6.46
677
εἰ δὲ μὴ πᾶσιν ἐθέλουσι συμβουλεύειν , οὐδὲν θαυμαστόν ·
But if they are not willing to give counsel to everybody, that is not surprising;


1.6.46
678
οὐ γὰρ ἀνάγκη αὐτοῖς ἐστιν ὧν ἂν μὴ θέλωσιν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
for they are under no compulsion to care for any one unless they will.


**2.1.1.679**
In such conversation they arrived at the Persian frontier.

**2.1.1.680**
And when an eagle appeared upon their right and flew on ahead of them, they prayed to the gods and heroes who watch over the land of Persia to conduct them on with grace and favour, and then proceeded to cross the frontier.

**2.1.1.681**
And when they had crossed, they prayed again to the tutelary gods of the Median land to receive them with grace and favour;

**2.1.1.682**
and when they had finished their devotions, they embraced one another, as was natural, and the father went back again to Persia, while Cyrus went on to Cyaxares in Media.

---

**2.1.2.683**
And when he arrived there, first they embraced one another, as was natural, and then Cyaxares asked Cyrus how large the army was that he was bringing.

**2.1.2.684**
Thirty thousand, he answered,

**2.1.2.685**
of such as have come to you before as mercenaries;

**2.1.2.686**
but others also, of the peers, who have never before left their country, are coming.

**2.1.2.687**
About how many? 

**2.1.2.688**
asked Cyaxares.

---

**2.1.3.689**
The number, said Cyrus, would give you no pleasure, if you were to hear it;

**2.1.3.690**
but bear this in mind, that though the so-called peers are few, they easily rule the rest of the Persians, many though they be.

**2.1.3.691**
But, he added, are you in any need of them, or was it a false alarm, and are the enemy not coming?

**2.1.3.692**
Yes, by Zeus, said he, they are coming and in great numbers, too.

---

**2.1.4.693**
How is this so certain?

**2.1.4.694**
Because, said he, many have come from there, and though one tells the story one way and another another, they all say the same thing.

**2.1.4.695**
We shall have to fight those men, then?

**2.1.4.696**
Aye, said he; we must of necessity.

**2.1.4.697**
Well then, said Cyrus, won’t you please tell me, if you know, how great the forces are that are coming against us; and tell me of our own as well, so that with full information about both we may lay our plans accordingly, how best to enter the conflict.

**2.1.4.698**
Listen then, said Cyaxares.

---

**2.1.5.699**
Croesus, the king of Lydia, is said to be coming at the head of 10,000 horsemen and more than 40,000 peltasts and bowmen.

**2.1.5.700**
And they say that Artacamas, the king of Greater Phrygia, is coming at the head of 8000 horse and not fewer than 40,000 lancers and peltasts; and Aribaeus, the king of Cappadocia, has 6000 horse and not fewer than 30,000 bowmen and peltasts; while the Arabian, Aragdus, has about 10,000 horsemen, about 100 chariots of war, and a great host of slingers.

**2.1.5.701**
As for the Greeks who dwell in Asia, however, no definite information is as yet received whether they are in the coalition or not.

**2.1.5.702**
But the contingent from Phrygia on the Hellespont, under Gabaedus, has arrived at Caÿstru-Pedium, it is said, to the number of 6000 horse and 10,000 peltasts.

**2.1.5.703**
The Carians, however, and Cilicians and Paphlagonians, they say, have not joined the expedition, although they have been invited to do so.

**2.1.5.704**
But the Assyrians, both those from Babylon and those from the rest of Assyria, will bring, I think, not fewer than 20,000 horse and not fewer, I am sure, than 200 war-chariots, and a vast number of infantry, I suppose;

**2.1.5.705**
at any rate, they used to have as many as that whenever they invaded our country.



**2.1.6.706**
You mean to say, said Cyrus, that the enemy have 60,000 horse and more than 200,000 peltasts and bowmen.

**2.1.6.707**
And at how many, pray, do you estimate the number of your own forces?

**2.1.6.708**
There are, said he, of the Medes more than 10,000 horse;

**2.1.6.709**
and the peltasts and bowmen might be, from a country like ours, some 60,000;

**2.1.6.710**
while from our neighbours, the Armenians, we shall get 4000 horse and 20,000 foot.

**2.1.6.711**
That is to say, said Cyrus, we have less than one-fourth as many horsemen as the enemy and about half as many foot-soldiers.

---

**2.1.7.712**
Tell me, then, said Cyaxares, do you not consider the Persian force small which you say you are bringing?

**2.1.7.713**
Yes, said Cyrus; but we will consider later whether we need more men or not.

**2.1.7.714**
Now tell me, he went on, what each party’s method of fighting is.

**2.1.7.715**
About the same with all, said Cyaxares;

**2.1.7.716**
for there are bowmen and spearmen both on their side and on ours.

**2.1.7.717**
Well then, said Cyrus, as their arms are of that sort, we must fight at long range.

---

**2.1.8.718**
Yes, said Cyaxares, that will be necessary.

**2.1.8.719**
In that case, then, the victory will be with the side that has the greater numbers;

**2.1.8.720**
for the few would be wounded and killed off by the many sooner than the many by the few.

**2.1.8.721**
If that is so, Cyrus, then what better plan could any one think of than to send to Persia to inform them that if anything happens to the Medes, the danger will extend to the Persians, and at the same time to ask for a larger army?

**2.1.8.722**
Why, said Cyrus, let me assure you that even though all the Persians were to come, we should not surpass the enemy in point of numbers.

---

**2.1.9.723**
What better plan do you see than this?

**2.1.9.724**
If I were you, said Cyrus, I should as quickly as possible have armour made for all the Persians who are coming here just like that of the so-called peers who are coming from our country — 
**2.1.9.725**
that is, a corselet to wear about the breast, a small shield upon the left arm, and a scimitar or sabre in the right hand.

**2.1.9.726**
And if you provide these weapons, you will make it the safest procedure for us to fight at close quarters with the enemy, while for the enemy flight will prove preferable to standing their ground.

**2.1.9.727**
And it is for us, he continued, to range ourselves against those who hold their ground,

**2.1.9.728**
while those of them who run away we propose to leave to you and the cavalry, that they may have no chance to stand their ground or to turn back.

---

**2.1.10.729**
Thus Cyrus spoke.

**2.1.10.730**
And to Cyaxares it seemed that he spoke to the point; and he no longer talked of sending for reinforcements, but he set about procuring the arms as suggested.

**2.1.10.731**
And they were almost ready when the Persian peers came with the army from Persia.

---

**2.1.11.732**
Thereupon Cyrus is said to have called the peers together and said:

**2.1.11.733**
My friends: When I saw you thus equipped and ready in heart to grapple with the enemy in a hand-to-hand encounter, and when I observed that those Persians who follow you are so armed as to do their fighting standing as far off as possible, I was afraid lest, few in number and unaccompanied by others to support you, you might fall in with a large division of the enemy and come to some harm.

**2.1.11.734**
Now then, said he, you have brought with you men blameless in bodily strength;

**2.1.11.735**
and they are to have arms like ours;

**2.1.11.736**
but to steel their hearts is our task;

**2.1.11.737**
for it is not the whole duty of an officer to show himself valiant, but he must also take care that his men be as valiant as possible.

---

**2.1.12.738**
Thus he spoke.

**2.1.12.739**
And they were all delighted, for they thought they were going into battle with more to support them.

**2.1.12.740**
And one of them also spoke as follows:



**2.1.13.741**
Now, he began, it will perhaps sound strange if I advise Cyrus to say something on our behalf, when those who are to fight along with us receive their arms.

**2.1.13.742**
But I venture the suggestion, for I know that when men have most power to do both good and ill, then their words also are the most likely to sink deep into the hearts of the hearers.

**2.1.13.743**
And if such persons give presents, even though the gifts be of less worth than those given by equals, still the recipients value them more highly.

**2.1.13.744**
And now, said he, our Persian comrades will be more highly pleased to be exhorted by Cyrus than by us; and when they have taken their place among the peers they will feel that they hold this honour with more security because conferred by their prince and their general than if the same honour were bestowed by us.

**2.1.13.745**
However, our co-operation must not be wanting, but in every way and by all means we must steel the hearts of our men.

**2.1.13.746**
For the braver these men are, the more to our advantage it will be.

---

**2.1.15.748**
Fellow-citizens of Persia, you were born and bred upon the same soil as we; the bodies you have are no whit inferior to ours, and it is not likely that you have hearts in the least less brave than our own.

**2.1.15.749**
In spite of this, in our own country you did not enjoy equal privileges with us, but because you were obliged to earn your own livelihood.

**2.1.15.750**
Now, however, with the help of the gods, I shall see to it that you are provided with the necessaries of life;

**2.1.15.751**
and you are permitted, if you wish, to receive arms like ours, to face the same danger as we, and, if any fair success crowns our enterprise, to be counted worthy of an equal share with us.

---

**2.1.16.752**
Now, up to this time you have been bowmen and lancers, and so have we; and if you were not quite our equals in the use of these arms, there is nothing surprising about that;

**2.1.16.753**
for you had not the leisure to practise with them that we had.

**2.1.16.754**
But with this equipment we shall have no advantage over you.

**2.1.16.755**
In any case, every man will have a corselet fitted to his breast, upon his left arm a shield, such as we have all been accustomed to carry, and in his right hand a sabre or scimitar with which, you see, we must strike those opposed to us at such close range that we need not fear to miss our aim when we strike.

---

**2.1.17.756**
In this armour, then, how could any one of us have the advantage over another except in courage?

**2.1.17.757**
And this it is proper for you to cherish in your hearts no less than we.

**2.1.17.758**
For why is it more proper for us than for you to desire victory, which gains and keeps safe all things beautiful and all things good?

**2.1.17.759**
And what reason is there that we, any more than you, should desire that superiority in arms which gives to the victors all the belongings of the vanquished?

---

**2.1.18.760**
He said in conclusion:

**2.1.18.761**
You have heard all. 

**2.1.18.762**
You see your arms;

**2.1.18.763**
whosoever will, let him take them and have his name enrolled with the captain in the same companies with us.

**2.1.18.764**
But whosoever is satisfied to be in the position of a mercenary, let him remain in the armour of the hired soldiery.



---

**2.1.19.765**
Thus he spoke.
**2.1.19.766**
And when the Persians heard it, they thought that if they were unwilling to accept, when invited to share the same toils and enjoy the same rewards, they should deserve to live in want through all time.

**2.1.19.767**
And so they were all enrolled and all took up the arms.

---

**2.1.21.769**
And first of all he received quartermasters from Cyaxares and commanded them to furnish ready made for each of the soldiers a liberal supply of everything that he needed.

**2.1.21.770**
And when he had provided for this, he had left them nothing to do but to practise the arts of war, for he thought he had observed that those became best in any given thing who gave up paying attention to many things and devoted themselves to that alone.

**2.1.21.771**
So, in the drill itself he relieved them of even the practice with bow and spear and left them only the drill with sword and shield and breastplate.

**2.1.21.772**
And so he at once brought home to them the conviction that they must go into a hand-to-hand encounter with the enemy or else admit that as allies they were good for nothing.

**2.1.21.773**
But such an admission is hard for those who know that they are being maintained for no other purpose than to fight for those who maintain them.

**2.1.23.775**
As rewards, moreover, he offered the following: in the case of captains, those who were thought to have got their companies into the best condition should be made colonels;




**2.1.23.776**
Moreover, all these officers not only had a right to claim the respect of their subordinates, but other distinctions also appropriate to each office followed in course.

**2.1.23.777**
And to those who should deserve praise still greater hopes were held out, in case in time to come any greater good fortune should befall.

---

**2.1.24.778**
Besides, he offered prizes of victory to whole companies and to whole platoons and to squads of ten and of five likewise, if they showed themselves implicitly obedient to the officers and very ready in performing the aforementioned duties.

**2.1.24.779**
And the prizes of victory for these divisions were just such as were appropriate to groups of men.

**2.1.24.780**
Such, then, were the competitions appointed, and the army began to train for them.

---

**2.1.25.781**
Then, he had tents made for them — in number, as many as there were captains; in size, large enough to accommodate each a company.

**2.1.25.782**
A company, moreover, was composed of a hundred men.

**2.1.25.783**
Accordingly, they lived in tents each company by itself;

**2.1.25.784**
for Cyrus thought that in occupying tents together they had the following advantages for the coming conflict: They saw one another provided for in the same way, and there could be no possible pretext of unjust discrimination that could lead any one to allow himself to prove less brave than another in the face of the enemy.

**2.1.25.785**
And he thought that if they tented together it would help them to get acquainted with one another.

**2.1.25.786**
And in getting acquainted with one another, he thought, a feeling of considerateness was more likely to be engendered in them all, while those who are unacquainted seem somehow more indifferent — like people when they are in the dark.

---

**2.1.26.787**
He thought also that their tenting together helped them not a little to gain a perfect acquaintance with their positions.

**2.1.26.788**
For the captains had the companies under them in as perfect order as when a company was marching single file, and the lieutenants their platoons, and the sergeants and corporals their squads in the same way.

---

**2.1.29.791**
Cyrus also took care that they should never come to luncheon or to dinner unless they had had a sweat.

**2.1.29.792**
For he would get them into a sweat by taking them out hunting; or he would contrive such sports as would make them sweat; or again, if he happened to have some business or other to attend to, he so conducted it that they should not come back without having had a sweat.

**2.1.29.793**
For this he considered conducive to their enjoying their meals, to their health, and to their being able to endure hardships, and he thought that hardships conduced to their being more reasonable toward one another, for even horses that work together stand more quietly together.

**2.1.29.794**
At any rate, those who are conscious that they have been well drilled are certainly more courageous in the face of the enemy.

---

**2.1.30.795**
And for himself Cyrus had a tent made big enough to accommodate all whom he might invite to dinner.

**2.1.30.796**
Now he usually invited as many of the captains as he thought proper, and sometimes also some of the lieutenants and sergeants and corporals; and occasionally he invited some of the privates, sometimes a squad of five together, or a squad of ten, or a platoon, or a whole company in a body.

**2.1.30.797**
And he also used to invite individuals as a mark of honour, whenever he saw that they had done what he himself wished everybody to do.

**2.1.30.798**
And the same dishes were always placed before those whom he invited to dinner as before himself.

---

**2.1.31.799**
The quartermasters in the army he always allowed an equal share of everything;

**2.1.31.800**
for he thought that it was fair to show no less regard for the purveyors of the army stores than for heralds or ambassadors.

**2.1.31.801**
And that was reasonable, for he held that they must be trustworthy, familiar with military affairs, and intelligent, and, in addition to that, energetic, quick, resolute, steady.

**2.1.31.802**
And still further, Cyrus knew that the quartermasters also must have the qualities which those have who are considered most efficient and that they must train themselves not to refuse any service but to consider that it is their duty to perform whatever the general might require of them.



2.2.1.803
Whenever Cyrus entertained company at dinner, he always took pains that the conversation introduced should be as entertaining as possible and that it should incite to good.

2.2.1.804
On one occasion he opened the conversation as follows:

2.2.1.805
"Tell me, men," said he, "do our new comrades seem to be any worse off than we because they have not been educated in the same way as we, or pray do you think that there will be no difference between us either in social intercourse or when we shall have to contend with the enemy?"

2.2.2.806
Well," said Hystaspas in reply,

2.2.2.807
"for my part, I cannot tell yet how they will appear in the face of the enemy.

2.2.2.808
But in social intercourse, by the gods, some of them seem ill-mannered enough.

2.2.2.809
The other day, at any rate," he explained, "Cyaxares had meat sent in to each company, and as it was passed around each one of us got three pieces or even more.

2.2.2.810
And the first time round the cook began with me as he passed it around;

2.2.2.811
but when he came in the second time to pass it, I bade him begin with the last and pass it around the other way.

2.2.3.812
Then one of the men sitting in the middle of the circle called out and said, "By Zeus, this is not fair at all — at any rate, if they are never going to begin with us here in the middle."

2.2.3.813
And when I heard that, I was vexed that any one should think that he had less than another and I called him to me at once.

2.2.3.814
He obeyed, showing good discipline in this at least.

2.2.3.815
But when that which was being passed came to us, only the smallest pieces were left, as one might expect, for we were the last to be served.

2.2.3.816
Thereupon he was greatly vexed and said to himself: "Such luck! that I should happen to have been called here just now!"

**2.2.4.817**  
Such luck! that I should happen to have been called here just now!

**2.2.4.818**  
And I said:

**2.2.4.819**  
Never mind;

**2.2.4.820**  
they will begin with us next time, and you, being first, will get the biggest piece.

**2.2.4.821**  
And at that moment the cook began to pass around the third time what was left of the course;

**2.2.4.822**  
and the man helped himself; and then he thought the piece he had taken too small;

**2.2.4.823**  
so he put back the piece he had, with the intention of taking another.

**2.2.4.824**  
And the cook, thinking that he did not want any more to eat, went on passing it before he got his other piece.


**2.2.5.825**  
Thereupon he took his mishap so to heart that he lost not only the meat he had taken but also what was still left of his sauce; for this last he upset somehow or other in the confusion of his vexation and anger over his hard luck.

**2.2.5.826**  
The lieutenant nearest us saw it and laughed and clapped his hands in amusement.

**2.2.5.827**  
And I,  he added,  pretended to cough;

**2.2.5.828**  
for even I could not keep from laughing.

**2.2.5.829**  
Such is one man, Cyrus, that I present to you as one of our comrades.

**2.2.5.830**  
At this they laughed, of course.

**2.2.6.831**  
But another of the captains said:

**2.2.6.832**  
Our friend here, it seems, Cyrus, has fallen in with a very ill-mannered fellow.

**2.2.6.833**  
But as for me, when you had instructed us about the arrangement of the lines and dismissed us with orders each to teach his own company what we had learned from you, why then I went and proceeded to drill one platoon, just as the others also did.

**2.2.6.834**  
I assigned the lieutenant his place first and arranged next after him a young recruit, and the rest, as I thought proper.

**2.2.7.835**  
Then I took my stand out in front of them facing the platoon, and when it seemed to me to be the proper time, I gave the command to go ahead.

**2.2.7.836**  
And that young recruit, mark you, stepped ahead — of the lieutenant and marched in front of him!

**2.2.7.837**  
And when I saw it, I said:

**2.2.7.838**  
Fellow, what are you doing?

**2.2.7.839**  
I am going ahead, as you ordered,  said he.

**2.2.7.840**  
Well,  said I,

**2.2.7.841**  
I ordered not only you, but all to go ahead.

**2.2.7.842**  
When he heard this, he turned about to his comrades and said:

**2.2.7.843**  
Don’t  you hear him scolding? He orders us all to go ahead.

**2.2.7.844**  
Then the men all ran past their lieutenant and came toward me.

**2.2.7.845**  
But when the lieutenant ordered them back to their places, they were indignant and said:

**2.2.8.846**  
Pray, which one are we to obey?

**2.2.8.847**  
For now the one orders us to go ahead, and the other will not let us.

**2.2.8.848**  
I took this good-naturedly, however, and when I had got them in position again, I gave instructions that no one of those behind should stir before the one in front led off, but that all should have their attention on this only — to follow the man in front.

**2.2.8.849**  
But when a certain man who was about to start for Persia  came up and asked me for the letter which I had written home, I bade the lieutenant run and fetch it, for he knew where it had been placed.

**2.2.9.850**  
So he started off on a run, and that young recruit followed, as he was, breastplate and sword; and then the whole fifty, seeing him run, ran after.

**2.2.9.851**  
And the men came back bringing the letter.

**2.2.9.852**  
So exactly, you see, does my company, at least, carry out all your orders.



2.2.10.853
The rest, of course, laughed over the military escort of the letter,

2.2.10.854
and Cyrus said:

2.2.10.855
"O Zeus and all the gods! What sort of men we have then as our comrades; they are so easily won by kindness that we can make many of them our firm friends with even a little piece of meat; and they are so obedient that they obey even before the orders are given.

2.2.10.856
I, for my part, do not know what sort of soldiers one could ask to have in preference to these!"

2.2.11.857
Thus Cyrus praised his soldiers, laughing at the same time.

2.2.11.858
But one of his captains, Aglaïtadas by name, one of the most austere of men, happened to be in Cyrus’s tent at the same time and he spoke somewhat as follows:

2.2.11.859
"You don’t mean to say, Cyrus, that you think what these fellows have been telling is true?"

2.2.11.860
"Well," said Cyrus, "what object could they have, pray, in telling a lie?"

2.2.11.861
"What object, indeed," said the other, "except that they wanted to raise a laugh; and so they tell these stories and try to humbug us."

2.2.12.862
"Hush," said Cyrus, "don’t call these men humbugs.

2.2.12.863
For to me, the name humbug seems to apply to those who pretend that they are richer than they are or braver than they are, and to those who promise to do what they cannot do, and that, too, when it is evident that they do this only for the sake of getting something or making some gain.

2.2.12.864
But those who invent stories to amuse their companions and not for their own gain nor at the expense of their hearers nor to the injury of any one, why should these men not be called witty and entertaining rather than humbugs?"

2.2.13.865
Thus Cyrus defended those who had furnished the fun,

2.2.13.866
and the captain himself who had told the anecdote about his platoon said:

2.2.13.867
"Verily, Aglaïtadas, you might find serious fault with us, if we tried to make you weep, like some authors who invent touching incidents in their poems and stories and try to move us to tears; but now, although you yourself know that we wish to entertain you and not to do you any harm at all, still you heap such reproaches upon us."

2.2.14.868
"Aye, by Zeus," said Aglaïtadas, "and justly, too, since he that makes his friends laugh seems to me to do them much less service than he who makes them weep;

2.2.14.869
and if you will look at it rightly, you, too, will find that I speak the truth.

2.2.14.870
At any rate, fathers develop self-control in their sons by making them weep, and teachers impress good lessons upon their pupils in the same way, and the laws, too, turn the citizens to justice by making them weep.

2.2.14.871
But could you say that those who make us laugh either do good to our bodies or make our minds any more fitted for the management of our private business or of the affairs of state?"

2.2.15.872
Hereupon Hystaspas answered somewhat as follows:

2.2.15.873
"If you will heed me, Aglaïtadas, you will freely expend this very valuable commodity upon your enemies and will try to set them to weeping;

2.2.15.874
but upon us and your friends here you will please to lavish this cheap article, laughter.

2.2.15.875
And you can, for I know you must have a great quantity of it stored up;

2.2.15.876
for you have never spent it upon yourself nor do you ever afford any laughter for your friends or for your enemies if you can help it.

2.2.15.877
So you have no excuse for begrudging us a laugh."

2.2.15.878
Aglaïtadas said:
2.2.15.879
"What, do you really think, Hystaspas, to get a laugh out of me?"
2.2.15.880
The other captain said:

2.2.15.881
"Well, by Zeus,he is a very foolish fellow, let me tell you, if he does;

2.2.15.882
for I believe one might rub fire out of you more easily than provoke a laugh from you."



2.2.16.883
At this, of course, the rest laughed; for they knew his character, and Aglaïtadas himself smiled at the sally.

2.2.16.884
And Cyrus, seeing him brighten up, said: "It is not right, captain, for you to corrupt our most serious man by persuading him to laugh, and that, too," said he, "when he is such a foe to laughter."

2.2.17.885
With that, the subject was dropt.

2.2.17.886
But at this point Chrysantas spoke as follows:

2.2.18.887
"Cyrus, and all you here present, I observe, for my part, that some have come out with us who are of superior merit, others who are less deserving than we.

2.2.18.888
Now, if we meet with success, these will all expect to have share and share alike.

2.2.18.889
And yet I do not believe that anything in the world is more unfair than for the bad and good to be awarded equal shares."

2.2.18.890
"Well, then, in the name of the gods, my men," Cyrus replied to this,

2.2.18.891
"will it not be a very good thing for us to suggest to the army a debate on this question: shall we, in case God gives us any success to reward our toils, give to all an equal share or shall we take into consideration each man’s services and bestow increased rewards upon him commensurate with them?"

2.2.19.892
"And what is the use," said Chrysantas, "of starting a discussion concerning this matter?

2.2.19.893
Why not rather announce that you propose to do thus and so? Pray, did you not announce the games and offer the prizes that way?"

2.2.19.894
"Yes, by Zeus," said Cyrus; "but this is not a parallel case.

2.2.19.895
For what the men obtain by fighting, that, I suppose, they will consider their own common property;

2.2.19.896
but the command of the army they still consider fairly to be mine, so that when I appoint the judges, I am sure they think I am within my rights."

2.2.20.897
"And do you really believe," said Chrysantas, "that the mass meeting would adopt a resolution that each one should not have an equal share, but that the best should have the preference both in honours and gifts?"

2.2.20.898
"Yes," said Cyrus, "I do, partly because we recommend it, and partly because it is mean to oppose a proposition that the one who suffers the most and does the most for the state should also receive the highest rewards.

2.2.20.899
"And I think," said he, "that even to the worst it will seem proper that the good should have the larger share."

2.2.21.900
Now Cyrus wished for the sake of the peers themselves that this measure should pass;

2.2.21.901
for he thought that even they themselves would be better, if they knew that they also should be judged by their works and should receive according to their deserts.

2.2.21.902
And so it seemed to him to be the proper time to bring this matter to a vote now, while the peers also were questioning the commoners’ claims to equality.

2.2.21.903
Accordingly, those in the tenth agreed to submit the question to a discussion and they said that whoever thought himself to be a man ought to advocate it.

2.2.22.904
But one of the captains said with a laugh:

2.2.22.905
"Well, I know a man of the commoners, too, who will support the proposition not to have share and share alike in that indiscriminate fashion."

2.2.22.906
Another asked him whom he meant;

2.2.22.907
and he answered:

2.2.22.908
"By Zeus, he is a messmate of ours, who in everything does his best to get the largest share."

2.2.22.909
Another asked.

2.2.22.910
"What! the largest share of hard work, too?" 

2.2.22.911
"No, by Zeus," said he; "not by any means;

2.2.22.912
but here I have been caught in a falsehood.

2.2.22.913
For my observation is that he very good-naturedly consents to have a smaller share of hard work and other things of that sort than anybody else."




2.2.23.914
"Well, men," said Cyrus, "I am convinced that such fellows as this one of whom our friend has just been telling us must be weeded out of the ranks, if we are to keep our army industrious and obedient.

2.2.23.915
For it seems to me that the majority of the soldiers are the sort to follow wherever any one leads;

2.2.23.916
and the good and noble, I think, try to lead only to what is good and noble, and the vicious to what is vicious."

2.2.24.917
"And therefore the base oftentimes find a larger following of congenial spirits than the noble.

2.2.24.918
For since vice makes her appeal through the pleasures of the moment, she has their assistance to persuade many to accept her views;

2.2.24.919
but virtue, leading up hill, is not at all clever at attracting men at first sight and without reflection; and especially is this true, when there are others who call in the opposite direction, to what is downhill and easy."

2.2.25.920
"And so, when people are bad only because of laziness and indolence, I believe that they, like drones, damage their associates only by the cost of their keeping.

2.2.25.921
But those who are poor companions in toil, and also extravagant and shameless in their desire for any advantage, these are likely also to lead others to what is vicious;

2.2.25.922
for they are often able to demonstrate that vice does gain some advantage.

2.2.25.923
And so we must weed out such men at any cost."

2.2.26.924
"Do not, however, endeavour to fill up their places in the ranks with your own countrymen only; but, just as in selecting a team you seek out not horses that are home-bred but those which are best, so also in the case of men, take them from all sources — whoever you think will be most likely to contribute to your strength and to your honour.

2.2.26.925
And I have the following illustrations to prove the worth of my suggestion:

2.2.26.926
a chariot would never go fast, I am sure, if slow horses were attached to it, nor would it be serviceable if horses unfit for service were harnessed to it; nor yet could a house be well managed if it employed vicious servants, but it would suffer less from having no servants at all than from being kept in confusion by incapable servants."

2.2.28.928
"With that he concluded;

2.2.28.929
and all his friends agreed that what he said was true, and they began to act upon that principle.

2.2.28.930
After that Cyrus began again to jest with them;

2.2.28.931
for he had observed that one of the lieutenants had brought along as a guest and companion at table an exceedingly hairy and exceedingly ill-favoured man; and addressing the lieutenant by name he spoke as follows:

2.2.28.932
'Well, Sambaulas,' said he, 'so you also have adopted the Greek fashion, have you, and take about with you everywhere this youngster who is now beside you, because he is so handsome?'

2.2.28.933
'Yes, by Zeus,' said Sambaulas; 'at all events I enjoy both his company and his looks.'"

2.2.29.934
"When his messmates heard this, they looked at the man;

2.2.29.935
and when they saw that his countenance was exceedingly ugly, they all laughed.

2.2.29.936
And one of them said:

2.2.29.937
'In the name of the gods, Sambaulas, what has this fellow done to make such a hit with you?'"

2.2.30.938
"By Zeus, fellows," he answered,

2.2.30.939
"I will tell you.

2.2.30.940
Every time that I have called him, whether by day or by night, he has never made any excuse saying that he had not time, nor has he answered my call slowly, but always on a run.

2.2.30.941
And as often as I have bidden him do anything, I have never seen him perform it without sweat;

2.2.30.942
and besides, by showing them not by precept but by example what sort of men they ought to be, he has made his whole squad of ten just like himself."

2.2.31.943
And yet," said one of the men,

2.2.31.944
"although he is such an excellent fellow, you don’t kiss him as you do your relatives?"

2.2.31.945
And the homely man answered this and said:

2.2.31.946
"No, by Zeus,

2.2.31.947
for he is not fond of hard work;

2.2.31.948
for if he wished to kiss me, that would be an ample substitute for all his drill-work."

2.3.1.949
Things of this sort, both grave and gay, were said and done at the dinner party.

2.3.1.950
And finally when they had made the third libation and prayed to the gods for their blessings, the party broke up, and they all went to bed.

2.3.1.951
Then on the morrow, Cyrus called all his soldiers together and spoke as follows:

2.3.2.952
"Friends, the conflict is at hand;

2.3.2.953
for the enemy are approaching.

2.3.2.954
As for the prizes of victory, if we are victorious — and we must assume that we shall be and work to that end — it is evident that the enemy and all that is theirs will belong to us.

2.3.2.955
But, on the other hand, if we are defeated — in this case, too, all the possessions of the vanquished are invariably the prizes set for the victors."

2.3.3.956
"Accordingly," said he, "you must realize that when men who are united as comrades in war are fully persuaded that nothing will come out as it should unless each individual man exerts himself, then many splendid achievements are speedily accomplished;

2.3.3.957
for nothing that needs to be done is neglected.

2.3.3.958
But when each one assumes that there will be some one else to do and to fight, even if he proves a weakling, let me assure you," said he, "that to such men, all alike, all that is grievous comes in a flood."

2.3.4.959
"And God has ordained it in some such way as this:

2.3.4.960
in the case of those who will not compel themselves to work out their own good, he assigns others to be their commanders.

2.3.4.961
Now, therefore, let any one stand up and speak to this question before us, whether he thinks that valour would be more cultivated among us, if the one who will do and dare most is also to receive the greatest rewards, or if we know that it makes no difference whether a man be a coward or not, 
2.3.4.962
as we shall all share and share alike."



2.3.5.963
Hereupon Chrysantas, one of the peers, a man neither large nor powerful to look upon, but preeminent in understanding, stood up and spoke:

2.3.5.964
"Well, Cyrus," said he, "I think that you are introducing this discussion not because you think that the bad ought to have an equal share with the good, but because you wish to prove whether a single man will really be found who will care to let it be known that he thinks that, even if he himself does nothing good and noble, he should have an equal share of that which others win by their valour.

2.3.6.965
Now I," he went on, "am neither fleet of foot nor strong of arm, and I know that in view of what I shall accomplish by my bodily strength I should not be judged either the first or the second, or even, I suppose, the thousandth, and perhaps not even the ten thousandth.

2.3.6.966
But on this point I am perfectly clear, that if those who are powerful men take matters vigorously in hand, I shall have as large a share of any good fortune that may come as I deserve.

2.3.6.967
But if the bad do nothing and the good and strong lose heart, I am afraid," said he, "that I shall have a larger share than I wish of something other than good."

2.3.7.968
Thus spoke Chrysantas.

2.3.7.969
And after him Pheraulas stood up, one of the Persian commoners, but a man who for some reason or other had from the beginning won Cyrus’s confidence and affection; besides he was well-favoured in body and a gentleman at heart. His speech was as follows:

2.3.8.970
"I think, Cyrus," said he, "and all you Persians here assembled, that we are all now starting on an equal footing in a contest of merit;

2.3.8.971
for I observe that we are all taking the same bodily exercise, that we all have the same rations, that we are all considered worthy to move in the same society, and that the prizes are offered alike to all.

2.3.8.972
For obedience to the officers has been enjoined equally upon us all, and whoever shows himself prompt to comply, I observe that he receives honour from Cyrus.

2.3.8.973
Again, to be brave in the face of the enemy is not a thing to be expected of one and not of another, but it is considered far the noblest thing for all alike.

2.3.9.974
And now," he continued, "we have been initiated into a method of fighting, which, I observe, all men naturally understand, just as in the case of other creatures each understands some method of fighting which it has not learned from any other source than from instinct: for instance, the bull knows how to fight with his horns, the horse with his hoofs, the dog with his teeth, the boar with his tusks.

2.3.9.975
And all know how to protect themselves, too, against that from which they most need protection, and that, too, though they have never gone to school to any teacher.

2.3.10.976
As for myself, I have understood from my very childhood how to protect the spot where I thought I was likely to receive a blow;

2.3.10.977
and if I had nothing else I put out my hands to hinder as well as I could the one who was trying to hit me.

2.3.10.978
And this I did not from having been taught to do so, but even though I was beaten for that very act of putting out my hands.

2.3.10.979
Furthermore, even when I was a little fellow I used to seize a sword wherever I saw one, although, I declare, I had never learned, except from instinct, even how to take hold of a sword.

2.3.10.980
At any rate, I used to do this, even though they tried to keep me from it — and certainly they did not teach me so to do —

2.3.10.981
just as I was impelled by nature to do certain other things which my father and mother tried to keep me away from.

2.3.10.982
And, by Zeus, I used to hack with a sword everything that I could without being caught at it.

2.3.10.983
For this was not only instinctive, like walking and running, but I thought it was fun in addition to its being natural.

2.3.11.984
Be that as it may," he went on, "since this method of fighting awaits us, which demands courage more than skill, why should we not gladly compete with the peers here?

2.3.11.985
For the prizes proposed for excellence are equal, but we shall go into the trial not having at stake interests equal with theirs; for they have at stake a life of honour, which is the most happy of all, while we risk only a life of toil unhonoured, which I think is most burdensome.

2.3.12.986
And this, comrades, gives me the most courage for the competition with these gentlemen, that Cyrus is to be the judge;

2.3.12.987
for he decides not with partiality, but (I swear it by the gods) I verily think that Cyrus loves no less than himself those whom he recognizes as valiant. At any rate, I observe that, whatever he has, he is much more pleased to give it to them than to keep it for himself.

2.3.13.988
And yet I know that these men pride themselves upon having been trained, as they say, to endure hunger and thirst and cold, but they do not know that in this we also have been trained by a better teacher than they have had;

2.3.13.989
for in these branches there is no better teacher than necessity, which has given us exceedingly thorough instruction in them."




2.3.15.991
"Let me inform you, therefore, Cyrus," said he, "that I, for one, shall not only enter this contest, but I shall also expect you to reward me according to my deserts, whatever I am, for better or worse.

2.3.15.992
And you, my fellow-commoners," he concluded, "I recommend you to enter with alacrity into the competition with these gentlemen in this sort of warfare;

2.3.15.993
for now they have been trapped in a contest with commoners."

2.3.16.994
Thus Pheraulas spoke.

2.3.16.995
And many others from both orders rose to speak in favour of the measure.

2.3.16.996
They decided that each one should receive rewards according to his deserts, and that Cyrus should be the judge.

2.3.16.997
Thus, then, the matter was satisfactorily settled.

2.3.18.999
Now when they had taken their stand thus equipped, he gave the order to begin battle.

2.3.18.1000
Then those on the one side threw their clods, and some struck the breastplates and shields, others also struck the thighs and greaves of their opponents.

2.3.18.1001
But when they came into close quarters, those who had the cudgels struck the others — some upon the thighs, others upon the arms, others upon the shins; and as still others stooped to pick up clods, the cudgels came down upon their necks and backs.

2.3.18.1002
And finally, when the cudgel-bearers had put their opponents to flight, they pursued them laying on the blows amid shouts of laughter and merriment.

2.3.18.1003
And then again, changing about, the other side took the cudgels with the same result to their opponents, who in turn threw clods.
2.3.18.1004
And they answered that they had been hit with the clods.

2.3.20.1006
And he inquired further, whether it had happened when they were close together or far apart.

2.3.20.1007
And they said it was when they were far apart.

2.3.20.1008
But when they came to close quarters, it was capital fun — so the cudgel-bearers said;

2.3.20.1009
but those who had been thoroughly drubbed with the cudgels cried out that it did not seem any fun to them to be beaten at close quarters,

2.3.20.1010
and at the same time they showed the marks of the cudgels on their arms and their necks and some also on their faces.

2.3.20.1011
And then, as was natural, they laughed at one another.

2.3.20.1012
On the following day the whole plain was full of men following their example;

2.3.20.1013
and if they had nothing more important to do, they indulged in this sport.

2.3.21.1014
And once he saw another captain leading his company up from the river left about in single file and ordering when he thought it was proper, the second division and then the third and the fourth to advance to the front;

2.3.21.1015
and when the lieutenants were in a row in front, he ordered each division to march up in double file.

2.3.21.1016
Thus the sergeants came to stand on the front line.

2.3.21.1017
Again, when he thought proper, he ordered the divisions to line up four abreast; in this formation, then, the corporals in their turn came to stand four abreast in each division;

2.3.21.1018
and when they arrived at the doors of the tent, he commanded them to fall into single file again, and in this order he led the first division into the tent;

2.3.21.1019
the second he ordered to fall in line behind the first and follow, and, giving orders in like manner to the third and fourth, he led them inside.

2.3.21.1020
And when he had thus led them all in, he gave them their places at dinner in the order in which they came in. Pleased with him for his gentleness of discipline and for his painstaking, Cyrus invited this company also with its captain to dinner. With another doubling up of ranks, they assume a front of sixteen men and a depth of six: Finally in these groups of six each, they are led, single file, in to dinner.



2.3.22.1021
Now there was present another captain who had been invited to the dinner and he said: "Cyrus, will you not invite my company to your tent?

2.3.22.1022
My company, too, does all this when we go to mess, 
2.3.22.1023
and when the meal is finished the rear-guard leader of the last division leads that division out, keeping in the rear those whose place in the battle line is in front;

2.3.22.1024
then, next after them, the second rear-guard leader brings out the men of the second division, and the third and the fourth in like manner, in order that," he explained, "they may also know how to withdraw, if ever it is necessary to retreat before the enemy.

2.3.22.1025
And when we take our places on the parade-ground, I take the lead, when we march toward the east, and the first division of the company goes first, the second in its proper order, and then the third and the fourth and the squads of ten and five in each division, until I give the order for some change of formation;

2.3.22.1026
then," said he, "when we march toward the west, the rear-guard leader and the rear-guard lead off first.

2.3.22.1027
Still, even so, they have to look to me for the commands, though I march last, so that they may get into the habit of obeying just the same whether they follow or whether they lead."

2.3.23.1028
asked Cyrus.
2.3.23.1029
"Do you always do that way?" 

2.3.23.1030
"Yes, by Zeus," said he, "as often as we go to dinner.

2.3.23.1031
"Well then," said Cyrus, "I will invite you, because you give your lines practice both in coming and in going, by night and by day, and also because you give your bodies exercise by marching about, and improve your minds by instruction.

2.3.23.1032
Since, therefore, you do all this doubly, it is only fair that I should furnish you a double feast also."

2.3.24.1033
"No, by Zeus," said the captain, "at any rate not on the same day, unless you will furnish us with double stomachs as well."

2.3.24.1034
Thus they brought that dinner to a close.

2.3.24.1035
And on the following day Cyrus invited that company, as he had promised, and again the next day.

2.3.24.1036
And when the others heard about it, they all followed, in the future, the example of that company.

2.4.1.1037
Once when Cyrus was holding a general review and parade of all his men under arms, a messenger came from Cyaxares saying that an embassy had arrived from India.

2.4.1.1038
"He therefore bids you come as soon as possible.

2.4.1.1039
Moreover," said the messenger, "I am bringing you a very beautiful robe from Cyaxares;

2.4.1.1040
for he expressed the wish that you appear as brilliant and splendid as possible when you come, for the Indians will see how you approach him."

2.4.2.1041
And when Cyrus heard this, he gave orders to the captain who was stationed first to take his stand at the head of the line, bringing up his company in single file and keeping himself to the right; he told him to transmit the same order to the second captain and to pass it on through all the lines.

2.4.2.1042
And they obeyed at once and passed the order on, and they all executed it promptly, and in a little while they were three hundred abreast on the front line, for that was the number of the captains, and a hundred men deep.

2.4.3.1043
And when they had got into their places, he ordered them to follow as he himself should lead.

2.4.3.1044
And at once he led them off at a double quick step.

2.4.3.1045
But when he became aware that the street leading to the king’s headquarters was too narrow to admit all his men with such a front, he ordered the first regiment in their present order to follow him, the second to fall in behind the first, and so on through them all, while he himself led on without stopping to rest, and the other regiments followed, each the one before it.

2.4.4.1046
And he sent also two adjutants to the entrance of the street, to tell what was to be done, if any one did not understand.

2.4.4.1047
And when they arrived at Cyaxares’s doors, he ordered the first captain to draw up his company twelve deep, while the sergeants were to take their places on the front line about the king’s headquarters. He bade him transmit the same orders to the second captain, and so on to all the rest.

2.4.5.1048
And they proceeded to do so,

2.4.5.1049
while he presented himself before Cyaxares in his Persian dress, which was not at all showy.

2.4.5.1050
When Cyaxares saw him, he was pleased at his promptness but displeased with the plainness of his dress and said:

2.4.5.1051
"How is this, Cyrus?

2.4.5.1052
What do you mean by appearing thus before the Indians?

2.4.5.1053
Now I wished you to appear with as much magnificence as possible,

2.4.5.1054
for it would have been a mark of respect to me to have my sister’s son appear in all possible grandeur."

2.4.6.1055
"Should I be showing you more respect, Cyaxares," Cyrus made reply to this,

2.4.6.1056
"if I arrayed myself in purple and adorned myself with bracelets and put on a necklace and at my leisure obeyed your orders, than I have in obeying you with such dispatch and accompanied by so large and so efficient an army? And I have come myself adorned with sweat and marks of haste to honour you and I present the others likewise obedient to you."

2.4.6.1057
Thus Cyrus spoke,

2.4.6.1058
and Cyaxares recognizing that he was right summoned the Indians.

2.4.7.1059
And when the Indians came in they said that the king of India had sent them with orders to ask on what ground the Medes and the Assyrians had declared war.

2.4.7.1060
"And he has ordered us," they said, "when we have heard your statement, to go also to the Assyrian and ask him the same question;

2.4.7.1061
and finally, he bade us say to both of you that the king of India declared that when he was weighed the merits of the case, he will side with the party wronged."

2.4.8.1062
Well, then, Cyaxares made reply to this,

2.4.8.1063
"let me tell you that we are not guilty of doing any wrong to the Assyrian; but go now, if you wish, and ask him what he has to say."

2.4.8.1064
And Cyrus, who was present, asked Cyaxares,

2.4.8.1065
"May I also tell them what I think?"

2.4.8.1066
And Cyaxares bade him say on.

2.4.8.1067
"Well then," said he, "if Cyaxares has no objection, tell the king of India that we propose, in case the Assyrian says he has been wronged by us, to choose the king of India himself to be our arbitrator."

2.4.8.1068
Upon hearing this, they went away.

2.4.9.1069
And when they had gone out, Cyrus addressed Cyaxares as follows:

2.4.9.1070
"Cyaxares, I came from home without very much money of my own,

2.4.9.1071
and of what I had I have very little left.

2.4.9.1072
I have spent it," he said, "upon my soldiers.

2.4.9.1073
Now you wonder, perhaps, how I have spent it upon them, when you are maintaining them; but I want you to know that it has gone for nothing else than rewards and entertainments, whenever I am pleased with any of my soldiers.

2.4.9.1074
And I want you to know," he said, "that I have done nothing else but honour and show my appreciation whenever I admired any of my soldiers."



2.4.10.1075
For, said he, in the case of all those whom one wishes to make efficient coadjutors in any enterprise of any sort whatsoever, it seems to me pleasanter to draw them on by kind words and kind services rather than by compulsion and force;

2.4.10.1076
but in the case of those whom one wishes to make enthusiastic followers in his plans of war, one must by all means try to capture them with kind words and kind offices.

2.4.10.1077
For those men who are to be trusty comrades, who will not envy their commander in his successes nor betray him in his adversity, must be his friends and not his enemies.

2.4.11.1078
Accordingly, as I recognize this in advance, I think I need more money.

2.4.11.1079
However, it seems to me unreasonable for every one to be looking to you, who, I observe, are put to great expense;

2.4.11.1080
but I think that you and I should together lay plans that funds may never fail you.

2.4.11.1081
For if you have plenty, I am sure it would be possible for me to draw money whenever I needed it, especially if I should take it to spend for something that would be more to your advantage also.

2.4.12.1082
Now I remember hearing you say one day recently that the Armenian king despises you now, because he has heard that the enemy are coming against you, and that therefore he is neither sending troops nor paying the tribute which is due.

2.4.12.1083
“Yes, Cyrus,” he answered; “that is just what he is doing;

2.4.12.1084
and so, for my part, I am in doubt whether it is better to proceed against him and try to enforce allegiance or to let him alone for the present, for fear we bring him also upon us as an enemy, in addition to the others.”

2.4.13.1085
But his residences, asked Cyrus,

2.4.13.1086
are they all in fortified places or are perhaps some of them in places easy of approach?

2.4.13.1087
His residences, answered Cyaxares,

2.4.13.1088
are in places not very well fortified;

2.4.13.1089
I did not fail to attend to that.

2.4.13.1090
However, there are mountains where he could take refuge and for a time be safe from falling into our hands himself, and where he could insure the safety of whatever he could have carried up there secretly, unless some one should occupy the approaches and hold him in siege, as my father did.

2.4.14.1091
Well, Cyrus then made answer,

2.4.14.1092
if you would give me as many horsemen as you think reasonable and send me there, I think that with the help of the gods I could make him send the troops and pay the tribute to you.

2.4.14.1093
And besides, I hope that he will be made a better friend to us than he now is.

2.4.15.1094
I also have hopes, Cyaxares replied,

2.4.15.1095
that they would come to you sooner than to me;

2.4.15.1096
for I understand that some of his sons were among your companions in the chase;

2.4.15.1097
and so, perhaps, they would join you again.

2.4.15.1098
And if they should fall into your hands, everything would be accomplished as we wish.

2.4.15.1099
Well then, said Cyrus, do you think it good policy to have this plan of ours kept a secret?

2.4.15.1100
Yes, indeed, said Cyaxares; for then some of them would be more likely to fall into our hands, and besides, if one were to attack them, they would be taken unprepared.

2.4.16.1101
Listen then, said Cyrus, and see if you think there is anything in what I say.

2.4.16.1102
Now I have often hunted with all my forces near the boundary between your country and the Armenians, and have even gone there with some horsemen from among my companions here.

2.4.16.1103
And so, said Cyaxares, if you were to do the same again, you would excite no suspicion;

2.4.16.1104
but if they should notice that your force was much larger than that with which you used to hunt, this would at once look suspicious.



2.4.17.1105  
But, said Cyrus, it is possible to devise a pretext that will be credited both here and also there, if some one bring them word that I wish to institute a great hunt;

2.4.17.1106  
and horsemen I should ask of you openly.

2.4.17.1107  
A very clever scheme! said Cyaxares;

2.4.17.1108  
and I shall refuse to give you more than a reasonable number, on the ground that I wish to visit the outposts on the Assyrian border.

2.4.17.1109  
And that will be no lie, for in reality, said he, I do wish to go there and to make them as strong as possible.

2.4.17.1110  
And when you have gone ahead with the forces you have and have already been hunting for two days, I will send you a sufficient number of the cavalry and infantry that are mustered with me, and you may take them and make an inroad at once.

2.4.18.1111  
And I myself, with the rest of my forces, will try to be not far away from you, to make my appearance upon the scene, should occasion require it.

2.4.18.1112  
Thereupon Cyaxares at once proceeded to get his cavalry and infantry together for visiting the outposts, and to send out wagon-loads of provisions on the road to the outposts.

2.4.18.1113  
But Cyrus proceeded to offer sacrifice in behalf of his expedition, and at the same time he sent to Cyaxares and asked for some of his younger horsemen.

2.4.18.1114  
But, although very many wished to go along, Cyaxares would not give him many.

2.4.18.1115  
Now after Cyaxares with his forces of cavalry and infantry had already started off on the road to the outposts, Cyrus’s sacrifice turned out favourable for proceeding against the Armenian.

2.4.19.1116  
Accordingly, he led his men out equipped as if for hunting.

2.4.19.1117  
And as he proceeded on his way, in the very first field a hare started up.

2.4.19.1118  
And an eagle flying up from the east caught sight of the hare as it ran and swooping down struck it, seized it, and carried it up, then bore it away to a hill not far off and disposed of his prey at his pleasure.

2.4.20.1119  
Then Cyrus, observing the omen, was delighted and did homage to Sovereign Zeus and said to those who were by:

2.4.20.1120  
Our hunt, comrades, please God, will be successful.

2.4.20.1121  
When they arrived at the frontier, he at once proceeded to hunt, as he used to do;

2.4.20.1122  
and the most of his men, on foot and on horseback, were marching in a straight line before him, in order to start up the game as they approached.

2.4.20.1123  
But the best of his foot and horse stood at intervals and lay in wait for what was started up, and pursued it in relays.

2.4.20.1124  
And they took many boars, deer, antelope, and wild asses; for many wild asses breed in those regions even unto this day.

2.4.21.1125  
And when he stopped hunting, he marched up to the Armenian border and dined;

2.4.21.1126  
and on the following day, he went up to the mountains toward which he was aiming and hunted again.

2.4.21.1127  
And when again he stopped, he sat down to dinner;

2.4.21.1128  
but when he saw the army from Cyaxares approaching, he sent to them secretly and bade them take their dinner at a distance of about two parasangs, for he foresaw that this also would contribute to the secrecy of his design;

2.4.21.1129  
but he ordered their commander to come to him when they had finished their dinner.

2.4.21.1130  
Then, after dinner, he called together his captains;

2.4.21.1131  
and when they had come he addressed them as follows:

2.4.22.1132  
My friends, the Armenian king formerly was both an ally and a dependent of Cyaxares;

2.4.22.1133  
but now since he has seen the enemy coming upon us, he is insolent and neither sends us his complement of soldiers nor pays his tribute.

2.4.22.1134  
Now, therefore, he is the game we have come to catch, if we can.

2.4.22.1135  
And here is the plan that I think we should pursue:

2.4.22.1136  
do you, Chrysantas, when you have had as much rest as you reasonably need, take half of the Persians who are with us, and following the mountain road take possession of the heights to which they say he flees for refuge when anything alarms him.





2.4.23.1137  
I will furnish you with guides.

2.4.23.1138  
Now they say that these mountains are thickly wooded, and so I have hopes of your not being seen.

2.4.23.1139  
Nevertheless, suppose you send ahead of your army some active men, in the guise of brigands both as to numbers and accoutrements; these, if they met any Armenians, would capture them and so prevent their spreading any reports; or, if they failed to capture them, they would frighten them away and so prevent their seeing the whole of your army, and would thus cause them to take precautions as against only a band of thieves.

2.4.24.1140  
Do you, then, said he, do this;

2.4.24.1141  
but I, at break of day, with half the infantry and all the cavalry, will proceed through the plain straight toward the capital.

2.4.24.1142  
And if he resists, we shall have to fight, of course;

2.4.24.1143  
and if he abandons the field, of course we shall have to chase him;

2.4.24.1144  
but if he flees to the mountain, then it is your business not to let any one of those who come your way escape.

2.4.25.1145  
And bear in mind that, just as in hunting, we shall be the ones beating out the game, you the man in charge of the nets.

2.4.25.1146  
Remember this, then, that the runs must be blocked before the game starts;

2.4.25.1147  
and those at the entrance to those runs must keep out of sight, if they are not to turn the animals aside as they come on.

2.4.26.1148  
However, he added, do not in this case do as you sometimes do, Chrysantas, in your fondness for hunting:

2.4.26.1149  
you often keep yourself busy all night without sleeping;

2.4.26.1150  
but now you should let your men rest long enough, so that they may be able to resist drowsiness.

2.4.28.1152  
And do not lead your men at a run because you are used to running up mountains,

2.4.28.1153  
but lead with moderate haste, that your army may be able to follow you easily.

2.4.29.1154  
And it is a good thing for some of the strongest and most zealous to fall back sometimes and encourage the rest;

2.4.29.1155  
and when the column has passed by them, it is an incentive to all to hasten when these are seen running past them as they walk.
2.4.30.1156  
On hearing this, Chrysantas was elated with his commission from Cyrus ; he took his guides and went away, and after giving what orders he thought necessary to those who were to go with him he went to rest.

2.4.30.1157  
And when they had slept as long as he thought reasonable, he started for the mountains.

2.4.31.1158  
And when it was day, Cyrus  sent forward a messenger to the Armenian with instructions to speak to him as follows:

2.4.31.1159  
King of Armenia , Cyrus  bids you take steps as quickly as possible to deliver to him the tribute and the troops.

2.4.31.1160  
And if he asks where I am, tell the truth and say that I am at the frontier.

2.4.31.1161  
And if he asks whether I also am coming in person, tell the truth in that case also and say that you do not know.

2.4.31.1162  
But if he inquires how many men we are, bid him send some one along with you and find out.

2.4.32.1163  
With such instructions he sent the messenger off, for he thought that this was a more friendly course than to march upon him without notice.

2.4.32.1164  
And he himself set out with his army in the formation which he thought best adapted both for covering distance and for fighting if necessary.

2.4.32.1165  
He ordered his soldiers to molest no one, and, if any one met any Armenians, to bid them have no fear but to say that if any one of them wished to sell food or drink, he should feel free to bring it wherever they were and open a market.




3.1.1
1166
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κῦρος ἐν τούτοις ἦν ·
Cyrus was thus employed;


3.1.1
1167
ὁ δὲ Ἀρμένιος ὡς ἤκουσε τοῦ ἀγγέλου τὰ παρὰ Κύρου , ἐξεπλάγη , ἐννοήσας ὅτι ἀδικοίη καὶ τὸν δασμὸν λείπων καὶ τὸ στράτευμα οὐ πέμπων , καὶ τὸ μέγιστον , ἐφοβεῖτο , ὅτι ὀφθήσεσθαι ἔμελλε τὰ βασίλεια οἰκοδομεῖν ἀρχόμενος ὡς ἂν ἱκανὰ ἀπομάχεσθαι εἴη .
but when the Armenian king heard from the envoy the message of Cyrus, he was alarmed, for he knew that he was doing wrong in withholding the tribute due and in failing to send the troops, and he was afraid most of all because he saw that he was sure to be detected in the act of beginning to build his palace in such a way as to render it strong enough for armed resistance.


3.1.2
1168
διὰ ταῦτα δὴ πάντα ὀκνῶν ἅμα μὲν διέπεμπεν ἁθροίζων τὴν ἑαυτοῦ δύναμιν , ἅμα δ’ ἔπεμπεν εἰς τὰ ὄρη τὸν νεώτερον υἱὸν Σάβαριν καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας , τήν τε ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τὴν τοῦ υἱοῦ , καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ·
Disturbed by the consciousness of all these faults, he sent around and collected his forces, and at the same time he sent away to the mountains his younger son, Sabaris, and the women, both his queen and his son’s wife, and his daughters.


3.1.2
1169
καὶ κόσμον δὲ καὶ κατασκευὴν τὴν πλείστου ἀξίαν συναπέπεμπε προπομποὺς δοὺς αὐτοῖς .
And he sent along with them his most valuable jewels and chattels and gave them an escort.


3.1.2
1170
αὐτὸς δὲ ἅμα μὲν κατασκεψομένους ἔπεμπε τί πράττοι Κῦρος , ἅμα δὲ συνέταττε τοὺς παραγιγνομένους τῶν Ἀρμενίων ·
At the same time he sent scouts to spy out what Cyrus was doing, while he went on assigning positions in his service to the Armenians as they came in to him.


3.1.2
1171
καὶ ταχὺ παρῆσαν ἄλλοι λέγοντες ὅτι καὶ δὴ αὐτὸς ὁμοῦ .
Presently still others arrived with the news that the man himself was quite near.


3.1.3
1172
ἐνταῦθα δὴ οὐκέτι ἔτλη εἰς χεῖρας ἐλθεῖν , ἀλλ’ ὑπεχώρει .
Then he no longer had the courage to join battle with him but retreated.


3.1.3
1173
ὡς δὲ τοῦτ’ εἶδον ποιήσαντα αὐτὸν οἱ Ἀρμένιοι , διεδίδρασκον ἤδη ἕκαστος ἐπὶ τὰ ἑαυτοῦ , βουλόμενοι τὰ ὄντα ἐκποδὼν ποιεῖσθαι .
When the Armenians saw him act thus, they dispersed at once, each to his own possessions, wishing to get their belongings out of the way.


3.1.3
1174
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὡς ἑώρα διαθεόντων καὶ ἐλαυνόντων τὸ πεδίον μεστόν , ὑποπέμπων ἔλεγεν ὅτι οὐδενὶ πολέμιος εἴη τῶν μενόντων .
And when Cyrus saw the plain full of men running about and driving away, he sent secretly to say that he had no quarrel with any who remained; but he declared that if he caught any one trying to get away, he should treat him as an enemy.


3.1.3
1175
εἰ δέ τινα φεύγοντα λήψοιτο , προηγόρευεν ὅτι ὡς πολεμίῳ χρήσοιτο .
Accordingly, the most of them remained, but some retreated with the king.


3.1.3
1176
οὕτω δὴ οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ κατέμενον , ἦσαν δ’ οἳ ὑπεχώρουν σὺν τῷ βασιλεῖ .
Now as those with the women in charge went forward they came upon the forces in the mountain.


3.1.4
1177
ἐπεὶ δ’ οἱ σὺν ταῖς γυναιξὶ προϊόντες ἐνέπεσον εἰς τοὺς ἐν τῷ ὄρει , κραυγήν τε εὐθὺς ἐποίουν καὶ φεύγοντες ἡλίσκοντο πολλοὶ γε αὐτῶν .
At once they raised a cry and as they tried to escape many of them were caught.


3.1.4
1178
τέλος δὲ καὶ ὁ παῖς καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ἑάλωσαν , καὶ χρήματα ὅσα σὺν αὐτοῖς ἀγόμενα ἔτυχεν .
And finally the young prince and the wives and daughters were captured and all the treasure that happened to be in the train.


3.1.4
1179
ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς αὐτός , ὡς ᾔσθετο τὰ γιγνόμενα , ἀπορῶν ποῖ τράποιτο ἐπὶ λόφον τινὰ καταφεύγει .
When the king himself learned what was going on, he was in a quandary which way to turn and took refuge upon a certain hill.


3.1.5
1180
ὁ δ’ αὖ Κῦρος ταῦτα ἰδὼν περιίσταται τὸν λόφον τῷ παρόντι στρατεύματι , καὶ πρὸς Χρυσάνταν πέμψας ἐκέλευε φυλακὴν τοῦ ὄρους καταλιπόντα ἥκειν .
And when Cyrus saw this he surrounded the hill with the troops he had with him and sent orders to Chrysantas to leave a guard upon the mountains and come.


3.1.5
1181
τὸ μὲν δὴ στράτευμα ἡθροίζετο τῷ Κύρῳ ·
Thus Cyrus’s army was being brought together.


3.1.5
1182
ὁ δὲ πέμψας πρὸς τὸν Ἀρμένιον κήρυκα ἤρετο ὧδε ·
Then he sent a herald to the Armenian to ask him the following question:


3.1.5
1183
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , πότερα βούλει αὐτοῦ μένων τῷ λιμῷ καὶ τῷ δίψει μάχεσθαι ἢ εἰς τὸ ἰσόπεδον καταβὰς ἡμῖν διαμάχεσθαι ;
Tell me, king of Armenia, he said, whether you prefer to remain there and fight against hunger and thirst, or to come down into the plain and fight it out with us?


3.1.5
1184
ἀπεκρίνατο ὁ Ἀρμένιος ὅτι οὐδετέροις βούλοιτο μάχεσθαι .
The Armenian answered that he had no wish to fight against either.


3.1.6
1185
πάλιν ὁ Κῦρος πέμψας ἠρώτα τί οὖν κάθησαι ἐνταῦθα καὶ οὐ καταβαίνεις ;
Again Cyrus sent to him and asked: Why then do you sit there and refuse to come down?


3.1.6
1186
ἀπορῶν , ἔφη , ὅ τι χρὴ ποιεῖν .
Because, he answered, I am in a quandary what to do.


3.1.6
1187
ἀλλ’ οὐδέν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ἀπορεῖν σε δεῖ ·
But said Cyrus, there is no occasion whatever for that;


3.1.6
1188
ἔξεστι γάρ σοι ἐπὶ δίκην καταβαίνειν .
for you are free to come down for trial.


3.1.6
1189
τίς δ’ , ἔφη , ἔσται ὁ δικάζων ;
And who, said he, will be my judge?


3.1.6
1190
δῆλον ὅτι ᾧ ὁ θεὸς ἔδωκε καὶ ἄνευ δίκης χρῆσθαί σοι ὅ τι βούλοιτο .
He, to be sure, to whom God has given the power to deal with you as he will, even without a trial.


3.1.6
1191
ἐνταῦθα δὴ ὁ Ἀρμένιος γιγνώσκων τὴν ἀνάγκην καταβαίνει ·
Then the Armenian, recognizing the exigency of his case, came down.


3.1.6
1192
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν εἰς τὸ μέσον κ- ἐκεῖνον καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα περιεστρατοπεδεύσατο , ὁμοῦ ἤδη πᾶσαν ἔχων τὴν δύναμιν .
And Cyrus received both the king and all that belonged to him into the midst and set his camp round them, for by this time he had all his forces together.


3.1.7
1193
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ τῷ χρόνῳ ὁ πρεσβύτερος παῖς τοῦ Ἀρμενίου Τιγράνης ἐξ ἀποδημίας τινὸς προσῄει , ὃς καὶ σύνθηρός ποτε ἐγένετο τῷ Κύρῳ ·
Now at this juncture Tigranes, the king’s elder son, returned from a journey abroad. He it was who had been Cyrus’s companion once on a hunt;


3.1.7
1194
καὶ ὡς ἤκουσε τὰ γεγενημένα , εὐθὺς πορεύεται ὥσπερ εἶχε πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον .
and when he heard what had occurred, he came at once, just as he was, to Cyrus.


3.1.7
1195
ὡς δ’ εἶδε πατέρα τε καὶ μητέρα καὶ ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα αἰχμαλώτους γεγενημένους , ἐδάκρυσεν , ὥσπερ εἰκός .
And when he saw his father and mother and brothers and sisters and his own wife all made prisoners, he wept, as might be expected.


3.1.8
1196
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ἄλλο μὲν οὐδὲν ἐφιλοφρονήσατο αὐτῷ , εἶπε δ’ ὅτι εἰς καιρὸν ἥκεις , ἔφη , ὅπως τῆς δίκης ἀκούσῃς παρὼν τῆς ἀμφὶ τοῦ πατρός .
But Cyrus, when he looked upon him, showed him no token of friendship, but merely remarked:


3.1.8
1197
καὶ εὐθὺς συνεκάλει τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τούς τε τῶν Περσῶν καὶ τοὺς τῶν Μήδων ·
You have come just in time to attend your father’s trial.


3.1.8
1198
προσεκάλει δὲ καὶ εἴ τις Ἀρμενίων τῶν ἐντίμων παρῆν .
And immediately he called together the officers of both the Medes and the Persians and all the Armenian nobles who were present.


3.1.8
1199
καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας ἐν ταῖς ἁρμαμάξαις παρούσας οὐκ ἀπήλασεν , ἀλλ’ εἴα ἀκούειν .
And the women who were there in their carriages he did not exclude but permitted them to attend.


3.1.9
1200
ὁπότε δὲ καλῶς εἶχεν , ἤρχετο τοῦ λόγου ·
When everything was in order, he began his examination:


3.1.9
1201
ὦ Ἀρμένιε , ἔφη , πρῶτον μέν σοι συμβουλεύω ἐν τῇ δίκῃ τ- ἀληθῆ λέγειν , ἵνα σοι ἕν γε ἀπῇ τὸ εὐμισητότατον ·
King of Armenia, said he, I advise you in the first place in this trial to tell the truth, that you may be guiltless of that offence which is hated more cordially than any other.


3.1.9
1202
τὸ γὰρ ψευδόμενον φαίνεσθαι εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι καὶ τοῦ συγγνώμης τινὸς τυγχάνειν ἐμποδὼν μάλιστα ἀνθρώποις γίγνεται ·
For let me assure you that being caught in a barefaced lie stands most seriously in the way of a man’s receiving any mercy.


3.1.9
1203
ἔπειτα δ’ , ἔφη , συνίσασι μέν σοι καὶ οἱ παῖδες καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὗται πάντα ὅσα ἔπραξας , καὶ Ἀρμενίων οἱ παρόντες ·
In the next place, said he, your children and your wives here and also the Armenians present are cognizant of everything that you have done;


3.1.9
1204
ἢν δὲ αἰσθάνωνταί σε ἄλλα ἢ τὰ γενόμενα λέγοντα , νομιοῦσί σε καὶ αὐτὸν καταδικάζειν σεαυτοῦ πάντα τὰ ἔσχατα παθεῖν , ἢν ἐγὼ τ- ἀληθῆ πύθωμαι .
and if they hear you telling anything else than the facts, they will think that you are actually condemning your own self to suffer the extreme penalty, if ever I discover the truth.


3.1.9
1205
ἀλλ’ ἐρώτα , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ὅ τι βούλει , ὡς τ- ἀληθῆ ἐροῦντος .
Well, Cyrus, said he, ask what you will, and be assured that I will tell the truth,


3.1.9
1206
τούτου ἕνεκα καὶ γενέσθω ὅ τι βούλεται .
let happen what will as a result of it.


3.1.10
1207
λέγε δή μοι , ἔφη , ἐπολέμησάς ποτε Ἀστυάγει τῷ τῆς ἐμῆς μητρὸς πατρὶ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις Μήδοις ;
Tell me then, said the other, did you ever have a war with Astyages, my mother’s father, and with the rest of the Medes?


3.1.10
1208
ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη .
Yes, he answered, I did.


3.1.10
1209
κρατηθεὶς δ’ ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ συνωμολόγησας δασμὸν οἴσειν καὶ συστρατεύσεσθαι ὅποι ἐπαγγέλλοι , καὶ ἐρύματα μὴ ἕξειν ;
And when you were conquered by him, did you agree to pay tribute and to join his army, wherever he should command you to go, and to own no forts?


3.1.10
1210
ἦν ταῦτα .
Those are the facts.


3.1.10
1211
νῦν οὖν διὰ τί οὔτε τὸν δασμὸν ἀπῆγες οὔτε τὸ στράτευμα ἔπεμπες , ἐτείχιζές τε τὰ ἐρύματα ;
Why, then, have you now failed to pay the tribute and to send the troops, and why have you been building forts?


3.1.10
1212
ἐλευθερίας ἐπεθύμουν ·
I longed for liberty;


3.1.10
1213
καλὸν γάρ μοι ἐδόκει εἶναι καὶ αὐτὸν ἐλεύθερον εἶναι καὶ παισὶν ἐλευθερίαν καταλιπεῖν .
for it seemed to me to be a glorious thing both to be free myself and to bequeath liberty to my children.


3.1.11
1214
καὶ γάρ ἐστιν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καλὸν μάχεσθαι , ὅπως μήποτέ τις δοῦλος μέλλοι γενήσεσθαι ·
You are right, said Cyrus; it is a noble thing to fight that one may never be in danger of becoming a slave.


3.1.11
1215
ἢν δὲ δὴ ἢ πολέμῳ κρατηθεὶς ἢ καὶ ἄλλον τινὰ τρόπον δουλωθεὶς ἐπιχειρῶν τις φαίνηται τοὺς δεσπότας ἀποστερεῖν ἑαυτοῦ , τοῦτον σὺ πρῶτος πότερον ὡς ἀγαθὸν ἄνδρα καὶ καλὰ πράττοντα τιμᾷς ἢ ὡς ἀδικοῦντα , ἢν λάβῃς , κολάζεις ;
But if any one has been conquered in war or in any other way reduced to servitude and is then caught attempting to rob his masters of himself, are you the first man to reward him as an honest man and one who does right, or do you punish him as a malefactor if you catch him?


3.1.11
1216
κολάζω , ἔφη ·
I punish him, said he;


3.1.11
1217
οὐ γὰρ ἐᾷς σὺ ψεύδεσθαι .
for you will not let me tell a lie.


3.1.12
1218
λέγε δὴ σαφῶς , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καθ’ ἓν ἕκαστον ·
Answer each of these questions explicitly then, said Cyrus;


3.1.12
1219
ἢν ἄρχων τις τύχῃ σοι καὶ ἁμάρτῃ , πότερον ἐᾷς ἄρχειν ἢ ἄλλον καθίστης ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ ;
if any one happens to be an officer under you and does wrong, do you permit him to continue in office or do you put another in his place?


3.1.12
1220
ἄλλον καθίστημι .
I put another in his place.


3.1.12
1221
τί δέ , ἢν χρήματα πολλὰ ἔχῃ , ἐᾷς πλουτεῖν ἢ πένητα ποιεῖς ;
And what if he has great possessions —  do you allow him to continue rich, or do you make him poor?


3.1.12
1222
ἀφαιροῦμαι , ἔφη , ἃ ἂν ἔχων τυγχάνῃ .
I confiscate all that he may happen to possess, said he.


3.1.12
1223
ἢν δὲ καὶ πρὸς πολεμίους γιγνώσκῃς αὐτὸν ἀφιστάμενον , τί ποιεῖς ;
And if you find out that he is trying to desert to the enemy, what do you do?


3.1.12
1224
κατακαίνω , ἔφη ·
I put him to death, said he;


3.1.12
1225
τί γὰρ δεῖ ἐλεγχθέντα ὅτι ψεύδομαι ἀποθανεῖν μᾶλλον ἢ τ- ἀληθῆ λέγοντα ;
I may as well confess, for why should I convict myself of lying and be put to death for that, instead of telling the truth?


3.1.13
1226
ἔνθα δὴ ὁ μὲν παῖς αὐτοῦ ὡς ἤκουσε ταῦτα , περιεσπάσατο τὴν τιάραν καὶ τοὺς πέπλους κατερρήξατο , αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἀναβοήσασαι ἐδρύπτοντο , ὡς οἰχομένου τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ ἀπολωλότων σφῶν ἤδη .
Then his son, when he heard this, stripped off his turban and rent his garments, and the women cried aloud and tore their cheeks, as if it were all over with their father and they were already lost.


3.1.13
1227
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος σιωπῆσαι κελεύσας εἶπεν ·
But Cyrus bade them be silent and said:


3.1.13
1228
εἶεν ·
Very well,


3.1.13
1229
τὰ μὲν δὴ σὰ δίκαια ταῦτα , ὦ Ἀρμένιε ·
king of Armenia; so that is your idea of justice;


3.1.13
1230
ἡμῖν δὲ τί συμβουλεύεις ἐκ τούτων ποιεῖν ;
in accordance with it, then, what do you advise us to do?


3.1.13
1231
ὁ μὲν δὴ Ἀρμένιος ἐσιώπα ἀπορῶν πότερα συμβουλεύοι τῷ Κύρῳ κατακαίνειν αὑτὸν ἢ τ- ἐναντία διδάσκοι ὧν αὐτὸς ἔφη ποιεῖν .
Then the Armenian was silent, for he was in a quandary whether to advise Cyrus to put him to death or to propose to him a course opposite to that which he admitted he himself always took.


3.1.14
1232
ὁ δὲ παῖς αὐτοῦ Τιγράνης ἐπήρετο τὸν Κῦρον ·
But his son Tigranes put a question to Cyrus, saying:


3.1.14
1233
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ἐπεὶ ὁ πατὴρ ἀποροῦντι ἔοικεν , ἦ συμβουλεύσω περὶ αὐτοῦ ἃ οἶμαί σοι βέλτιστα εἶναι ;
Tell me, Cyrus, since my father seems to be in doubt, may I advise you in regard to him what I think the best course for you?


3.1.14
1234
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος , ᾐσθημένος , ὅτε συνεθήρα αὐτῷ ὁ Τιγράνης , σοφιστήν τινα αὐτῷ συνόντα καὶ θαυμαζόμενον ὑπὸ τοῦ Τιγράνου , πάνυ ἐπεθύμει αὐτοῦ ἀκοῦσαι ὅ τι ποτ’ ἐροίη ·
Now Cyrus had observed when Tigranes used to go hunting with him that there was a certain philosopher with him who was an object of admiration to Tigranes; consequently he was very eager to hear what he would say.


3.1.14
1235
καὶ προθύμως ἐκέλευσε λέγειν ὅ τι γιγνώσκοι .
So he bade him express his opinion with confidence.


3.1.15
1236
ἐγὼ τοίνυν , ἔφη ὁ Τιγράνης , εἰ μὲν ἄγασαι τοῦ πατρὸς ἢ ὅσα βεβούλευται ἢ ὅσα πέπραχε , πάνυ σοι συμβουλεύω τοῦτον μιμεῖσθαι ·
Well said Tigranes, if you approve either of my father’s theory or his practice, then I advise you by all means to imitate him.


3.1.15
1237
εἰ μέντοι σοι δοκεῖ πάντα ἡμαρτηκέναι , συμβουλεύω τοῦτον μὴ μιμεῖσθαι .
But if you think he has done wrong throughout, I advise you not to imitate him.


3.1.15
1238
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , τὰ δίκαια ποιῶν ἥκιστ’ ἂν τὸν ἁμαρτάνοντα μιμοίμην .
Well then, said Cyrus, if I should do what is right, I should surely not be imitating the one who does wrong.


3.1.15
1239
ἔστιν , ἔφη , ταῦτα .
That is true, said he.


3.1.15
1240
κολαστέον ἄρ’ ἂν εἴη κατά γε τὸν σὸν λόγον τὸν πατέρα , εἴπερ τὸν ἀδικοῦντα δίκαιον κολάζειν .
Then, according to your reasoning, your father must be punished, if indeed it is right that the one who does wrong should be punished.


3.1.15
1241
πότερα δ’ ἡγῇ , ὦ Κῦρε , ἄμεινον εἶναι σὺν τῷ σῷ ἀγαθῷ τὰς τιμωρίας ποιεῖσθαι ἢ σὺν τῇ σῇ ζημίᾳ ;
Which do you think is better for you, Cyrus, to mete out your punishments to your benefit or to your own injury?


3.1.15
1242
ἐμαυτὸν ἄρα , ἔφη , οὕτω γ’ ἂν τιμωροίμην .
In the latter case, at least, said he, I should be punishing myself.


3.1.16
1243
ἀλλὰ μέντοι , ἔφη ὁ Τιγράνης , μεγάλα γ’ ἂν ζημιοῖο , εἰ τοὺς σεαυτοῦ κατακαίνοις τότε ὁπότε σοι πλείστου ἄξιοι εἶεν κεκτῆσθαι .
Aye, but you would be doing yourself a great injury, said Tigranes, if you should put your friends to death just at the time when it was of the greatest advantage to you to have them.


3.1.16
1244
πῶς δ’ ἄν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , τότε πλείστου ἄξιοι γίγνοιντο ἅνθρωποι ὁπότε ἀδικοῦντες ἁλίσκοιντο ;
How said Cyrus, could men be of the greatest advantage to me just at the time when they were caught doing wrong?


3.1.16
1245
εἰ τότε , οἶμαι , σώφρονες γίγνοιντο .
They would be, I think, if at that time they should become discreet.


3.1.16
1246
δοκεῖ γάρ μοι , ὦ Κῦρε , οὕτως ἔχειν , ἄνευ μὲν σωφροσύνης οὐδ’ ἄλλης ἀρετῆς οὐδὲν ὄφελος εἶναι ·
For it seems to me to be true, Cyrus, said he, that without discretion there is no advantage at all in any other virtue;


3.1.16
1247
τί γὰρ ἄν , ἔφη , χρήσαιτ’ ἄν τις ἰσχυρῷ ἢ ἀνδρείῳ μὴ σώφρονι , ἢ ἱππικῷ , τί δὲ πλουσίῳ , τί δὲ δυνάστῃ ἐν πόλει ;
for what, he continued, could one do with a strong man or a brave man, or what with a rich man or a man of power in the state if he lacked discretion?


3.1.16
1248
σὺν δὲ σωφροσύνῃ καὶ φίλος πᾶς χρήσιμος καὶ θεράπων πᾶς ἀγαθός .
But every friend is useful and every servant good, if he be endowed with discretion.


3.1.17
1249
τοῦτ’ οὖν , ἔφη , λέγεις ὡς καὶ ὁ σὸς πατὴρ ἐν τῇδε τῇ μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ ἐξ ἄφρονος σώφρων γεγένηται ;
Do you mean to say, then, said Cyrus, that in one day’s time your father has become discreet when he was indiscreet before?


3.1.17
1250
πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .
Yes said he, I do, indeed.


3.1.17
1251
πάθημα ἄρα τῆς ψυχῆς σὺ λέγεις εἶναι τὴν σωφροσύνην , ὥσπερ λύπην , οὐ μάθημα ·
By that you mean to say that discretion is an affection of the soul, as sorrow is, and not an acquisition.


3.1.17
1252
οὐ γὰρ ἂν δήπου , εἴγε φρόνιμον δεῖ γενέσθαι τὸν μέλλοντα σώφρονα ἔσεσθαι , παραχρῆμα ἐξ ἄφρονος σώφρων ἄν τις γένοιτο .
For I do not suppose that a man could instantly pass from being indiscreet to being discreet, if indeed the one who is to be discreet must first have become wise.


3.1.18
1253
τί δ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , οὔπω ᾔσθου καὶ ἕνα ἄνδρα δι’ ἀφροσύνην μὲν ἐπιχειροῦντα κρείττονι ἑαυτοῦ μάχεσθαι , ἐπειδὰν δὲ ἡττηθῇ , εὐθὺς πεπαυμένον τῆς πρὸς τοῦτον ἀφροσύνης ;
What, have you never observed, Cyrus, said he, that when a man indiscreetly ventures to fight a stronger man than himself and has been worsted, he is instantly cured of his indiscretion toward that particular man?


3.1.18
1254
πάλιν δ’ , ἔφη , οὔπω ἑώρακας πόλιν ἀντιταττομένην πρὸς πόλιν ἑτέραν , ἧς ἐπειδὰν ἡττηθῇ παραχρῆμα ταύτῃ ἀντὶ τοῦ μάχεσθαι πείθεσθαι ἐθέλει ;
And again, he continued, have you never seen how when one state is in arms against another it is at once willing, when defeated, to submit to the victor instead of continuing the fight?


3.1.19
1255
ποίαν δ’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καὶ σὺ τοῦ πατρὸς ἧτταν λέγων οὕτως ἰσχυρίζει σεσωφρονίσθαι αὐτόν ;
To what defeat of your father’s do you refer, said Cyrus, that you are so confident that he has been brought to discretion by it?


3.1.19
1256
ἧι νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , σύνοιδεν ἑαυτῷ ἐλευθερίας μὲν ἐπιθυμήσας , δοῦλος δ’ ὡς οὐδεπώποτε γενόμενος , ἃ δὲ ᾠήθη χρῆναι λαθεῖν ἢ φθάσαι ἢ ἀποβιάσασθαι , οὐδὲν τούτων ἱκανὸς γενόμενος διαπράξασθαι .
Why that, by Zeus, Tigranes answered, which he is conscious of having sustained, inasmuch as when he aimed at securing liberty he has become more of a slave than ever, and as he has not been able to accomplish a single thing of all that he thought he should effect by secrecy or by surprise or by actual force.


3.1.19
1257
σὲ δὲ οἶδεν , ἃ μὲν ἐβουλήθης ἐξαπατῆσαι αὐτόν , οὕτως ἐξαπατήσαντα ὥσπερ ἄν τις τυφλοὺς καὶ κωφοὺς καὶ μηδ’ ὁτιοῦν φρονοῦντας ἐξαπατήσειεν ·
And he knows that when you desired to outwit him, you did it as effectually as one could do who set out to deceive men blind or deaf or deprived of all their senses;


3.1.19
1258
ἃ δὲ ᾠήθης λαθεῖν χρῆναι , οὕτω σὲ οἶδε λαθόντα ὥστε ἃ ἐνόμιζεν ἑαυτῷ ἐχυρὰ χωρία ἀποκεῖσθαι , σὺ εἰρκτὰς ταῦτα ἔλαθες προκατασκευάσας ·
and when you thought you ought to act secretly, you acted with such secrecy that the fortified places which he thought he had provided for his own safety you had secretly turned into prisons for him in advance.


3.1.19
1259
τάχει δὲ τοσοῦτον περιεγένου αὐτοῦ ὥστε πρόσωθεν ἔφθασας ἐλθὼν σὺν πολλῷ στόλῳ πρὶν τοῦτον τὴν παρ’ ἑαυτῷ δύναμιν ἁθροίσασθαι .
And so much did you surpass him in dispatch, that you came from a distance with a large army before he could muster the forces he had at home.


3.1.20
1260
ἔπειτα δοκεῖ σοι , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καὶ ἡ τοιαύτη ἧττα σωφρονίζειν ἱκανὴ εἶναι ἀνθρώπους , τὸ γνῶναι ἄλλους ἑαυτῶν βελτίονας ὄντας ;
Well said Cyrus, do you really think that such a defeat is adequate to make men discreet — I mean, when they find out that others are their superiors?


3.1.20
1261
πολύ γε μᾶλλον , ἔφη ὁ Τιγράνης , ἢ ὅταν μάχῃ τις ἡττηθῇ .
Yes said Tigranes, much more than when they are defeated in combat.


3.1.20
1262
ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἰσχύι κρατηθεὶς ἔστιν ὅτε ᾠήθη σωμασκήσας ἀναμαχεῖσθαι ·
For the one who is overcome by strength sometimes conceives the idea that, if he trains his body, he may renew the combat.


3.1.20
1263
καὶ πόλεις γε ἁλοῦσαι συμμάχους προσλαβοῦσαι οἴονται ἀναμαχέσασθαι ἄν ·
Even cities too, when captured, think that by taking on new allies they might renew the fight.


3.1.20
1264
οὓς δ’ ἂν βελτίους τινὲς ἑαυτῶν ἡγήσωνται , τούτοις πολλάκις καὶ ἄνευ ἀνάγκης ἐθέλουσι πείθεσθαι .
But if people are convinced that others are superior to themselves, they are often ready even without compulsion to submit to them.


3.1.21
1265
σύ , ἔφη , ἔοικας οὐκ οἴεσθαι τοὺς ὑβριστὰς γιγνώσκειν τοὺς ἑαυτῶν σωφρονεστέρους , οὐδὲ τοὺς κλέπτας τοὺς μὴ κλέπτοντας , οὐδὲ τοὺς ψευδομένους τοὺς τ- ἀληθῆ λέγοντας , οὐδὲ τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας τοὺς τὰ δίκαια ποιοῦντας ·
You seem to think, said the other, that the insolent do not recognize those more discreet than they, that thieves do not recognize the truthful, and wrong-doers those who do right.


3.1.21
1266
οὐκ οἶσθα , ἔφη , ὅτι καὶ νῦν ὁ σὸς πατὴρ ἐψεύσατο καὶ οὐκέτ’ ἠμπέδου τὰς πρὸς ἡμᾶς συνθήκας , εἰδὼς ὅτι ἡμεῖς οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν ὧν Ἀστυάγης συνέθετο παραβαίνομεν ;
Do you not know, he continued, that even now your father has played false and has not kept his agreement with us, although he knew that we have not been violating any of the agreements made by Astyages?


3.1.22
1267
ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἐγὼ τοῦτο λέγω ὡς τὸ γνῶναι μόνον τοὺς βελτίονας σωφρονίζει ἄνευ τοῦ δίκην διδόναι ὑπὸ τῶν βελτιόνων , ὥσπερ ὁ ἐμὸς πατὴρ νῦν δίδωσιν .
Yes; but neither do I mean that simply recognizing their superiors makes people discreet, unless they are punished by those superiors, as my father now is.


3.1.22
1268
ἀλλ’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὅ γε σὸς πατὴρ πέπονθε μὲν οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν πω κακόν ·
But said Cyrus, your father has not yet suffered the least harm;


3.1.22
1269
φοβεῖταί γε μέντοι εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι μὴ πάντα τὰ ἔσχατα πάθῃ .
but he is afraid, to be sure, that he will suffer the worst.


3.1.23
1270
οἴει οὖν τι , ἔφη ὁ Τιγράνης , μᾶλλον καταδουλοῦσθαι ἀνθρώπους τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ φόβου ;
Do you think, then, said Tigranes, that anything breaks a man’s spirit sooner than object fear?


3.1.23
1271
οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι οἱ μὲν τῷ ἰσχυροτάτῳ κολάσματι νομιζομένῳ σιδήρῳ παιόμενοι ὅμως ἐθέλουσι καὶ πάλιν μάχεσθαι τοῖς αὐτοῖς ;
Do you not know that those who are beaten with the sword, which is considered the most potent instrument of correction, are nevertheless ready to fight the same enemy again;


3.1.23
1272
οὓς δ’ ἂν σφόδρα φοβηθῶσιν ἄνθρωποι , τούτοις οὐδὲ παραμυθουμένοις ἔτι ἀντιβλέπειν δύνανται ;
but when people really fear anyone very much, then they cannot look him in the face, even when he tries to cheer them?


3.1.23
1273
λέγεις σύ , ἔφη , ὡς ὁ φόβος τοῦ ἔργῳ κακοῦσθαι μᾶλλον κολάζει τοὺς ἀνθρώπους .
You mean to say, said he, that fear is a heavier punishment to men than real correction.


3.1.24
1274
καὶ σύ γε , ἔφη , οἶσθα ὅτι ἀληθῆ λέγω ·
And you, said he, know that what I say is true;


3.1.24
1275
ἐπίστασαι γὰρ ὅτι οἱ μὲν φοβούμενοι μὴ φύγωσι πατρίδα καὶ οἱ μέλλοντες μάχεσθαι δεδιότες μὴ ἡττηθῶσιν ἀθύμως διάγουσι , καὶ οἱ πλέοντες μὴ ναυαγήσωσι , καὶ οἱ δουλείαν καὶ δεσμὸν φοβούμενοι , οὗτοι μὲν οὔτε σίτου οὔθ’ ὕπνου δύνανται λαγχάνειν διὰ τὸν φόβον ·
for you are aware that, on the one hand, those who are afraid that they are to be exiled from their native land, and those who on the eve of battle are afraid that they shall be defeated, and those who fear slavery or bondage, all such can neither eat nor sleep for fear;


3.1.24
1276
οἱ δὲ ἤδη μὲν φυγάδες , ἤδη δ’ ἡττημένοι , ἤδη δὲ δουλεύοντες , ἔστιν ὅτε δύνανται καὶ μᾶλλον τῶν εὐδαιμόνων ἐσθίειν τε καὶ καθεύδειν .
whereas those who are already in exile or already defeated or already in slavery can sometimes eat and sleep better than those enjoying a happier lot.


3.1.25
1277
ἔτι δὲ φανερώτερον καὶ ἐν τοῖσδε οἷον φόρημα ὁ φόβος ·
And from the following considerations it is still clearer what a burden fear is:


3.1.25
1278
ἔνιοι γὰρ φοβούμενοι μὴ ληφθέντες ἀποθάνωσι προαποθνῄσκουσιν ὑπὸ τοῦ φόβου , οἱ μὲν ῥιπτοῦντες ἑαυτούς , οἱ δ’ ἀπαγχόμενοι , οἱ δ’ ἀποσφαττόμενοι ·
some, for fear that they will be caught and put to death, in terror take their own lives before their time — some by hurling themselves over a precipice, other by hanging themselves, others by cutting their own throats;


3.1.25
1279
οὕτω πάντων τῶν δεινῶν ὁ φόβος μάλιστα καταπλήττει τὰς ψυχάς .
so does fear crush down the soul more than all other terrors.


3.1.25
1280
τὸν δ’ ἐμὸν πατέρα , ἔφη , νῦν πῶς δοκεῖς διακεῖσθαι τὴν ψυχήν , ὃς οὐ μόνον περὶ ἑαυτοῦ , ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ ἐμοῦ καὶ περὶ γυναικὸς καὶ περὶ πάντων τῶν τέκνων δουλείας φοβεῖται ;
As for my father, he added, in what a state of mind do you think he is? For he is in dread not only for himself, but also for me, for his wife, and for all of his children.


3.1.25
1281
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
And Cyrus said:


3.1.26
1282
ἀλλὰ νῦν μὲν ἔμοιγε οὐδὲν ἄπιστον τοῦτον οὕτω διακεῖσθαι ·
Well, answered Cyrus, it is not at all unlikely, I suppose, that he is for the moment in such a state of mind.


3.1.26
1283
δοκεῖ μέντοι μοι τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀνδρὸς εἶναι καὶ εὐτυχοῦντα ἐξυβρίσαι καὶ πταίσαντα ταχὺ πτῆξαι , καὶ ἀνεθέντα γε πάλιν αὖ μέγα φρονῆσαι καὶ πάλιν αὖ πράγματα παρασχεῖν .
However, it seems to me that we expect of a man who is insolent in success and abject in failure that, when set on his feet once more, he will again wax arrogant and again cause more trouble.


3.1.27
1284
ἀλλὰ ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ἔχει μὲν προφάσεις τὰ ἡμέτερα ἁμαρτήματα ὥστ’ ἀπιστεῖν ἡμῖν ·
Well, by Zeus, Cyrus, said he, our wrong-doing does, no doubt, give you cause to distrust us;


3.1.27
1285
ἔξεστι δέ σοι καὶ φρούρια ἐντειχίζειν καὶ τὰ ἐχυρὰ κατέχειν καὶ ἄλλο ὅ τι ἂν βούλῃ πιστὸν λαμβάνειν .
but you may build forts in our country and occupy the strongholds already built and take whatever else you wish as security.


3.1.27
1286
καὶ μέντοι , ἔφη , ἡμᾶς μὲν ἕξεις οὐδέν τι τούτοις μέγα λυπουμένους ·
And yet, he added, you will not find us very much aggrieved by your doing so;


3.1.27
1287
μεμνησόμεθα γὰρ ὅτι ἡμεῖς αὐτῶν αἴτιοί ἐσμεν ·
for we shall remember that we are to blame for it all.


3.1.27
1288
εἰ δέ τινι τῶν ἀναμαρτήτων παραδοὺς τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀπιστῶν αὐτοῖς φανεῖ , ὅρα μὴ ἅμα τε εὖ ποιήσεις καὶ ἅμα οὐ φίλον νομιοῦσί σε ·
But if you hand over our government to some one of those who have done no wrong and yet show that you distrust them, see to it lest they regard you as no friend, in spite of your favours to them.


3.1.27
1289
εἰ δ’ αὖ φυλαττόμενος τὸ ἀπεχθάνεσθαι μὴ ἐπιθήσεις αὐτοῖς ζυγὰ τοῦ μὴ ὑβρίσαι , ὅρα μὴ ἐκείνους αὖ δεήσει σε σωφρονίζειν ἔτι μᾶλλον ἢ ἡμᾶς νῦν ἐδέησεν .
But if again, on your guard against incurring their hatred, you fail to place a check upon them to keep them from rebellion, see to it lest you need to bring them to discretion even more than you did in our case just now.


3.1.28
1290
ἀλλὰ ναὶ μὰ τοὺς θεούς , ἔφη , τοιούτοις μὲν ἔγωγε ὑπηρέταις , οὓς εἰδείην ἀνάγκῃ ὑπηρετοῦντας , ἀηδῶς ἄν μοι δοκῶ χρῆσθαι ·
Nay, by the gods, said he, I do not think I should like to employ servants that I knew served me only from compulsion.


3.1.28
1291
οὓς δὲ γιγνώσκειν δοκοίην ὅτι εὐνοίᾳ καὶ φιλίᾳ τῇ ἐμῇ τὸ δέον συλλαμβάνοιεν , τούτους ἄν μοι δοκῶ καὶ ἁμαρτάνοντας ῥᾷον φέρειν ἢ τοὺς μισοῦντας μέν , ἔκπλεω δὲ πάντα ἀνάγκῃ διαπονουμένους .
But if I had servants who I thought assisted me, as in duty bound, out of goodwill and friendship toward me, I think I should be better satisfied with them when they did wrong than with others who disliked me, when they performed all their tasks faithfully but from compulsion.


3.1.28
1292
καὶ ὁ Τιγράνης εἶπε πρὸς ταῦτα ·
To this Tigranes replied:


3.1.28
1293
φιλίαν δὲ παρὰ τίνων ἄν ποτε λάβοις τοσαύτην ὅσην σοι παρ’ ἡμῶν ἔξεστι κτήσασθαι νῦν ;
From whom could you ever get such friendship as you now can from us?


3.1.28
1294
παρ’ ἐκείνων οἶμαι , ἔφη , παρὰ τῶν μηδέποτε πολεμίων γεγενημένων , εἰ ἐθέλοιμι εὐεργετεῖν αὐτοὺς ὥσπερ σὺ νῦν με κελεύεις εὐεργετεῖν ὑμᾶς .
From those, I presume, said he, who have never been my enemies, if I would do them such favours as you now bid me do you.


3.1.29
1295
ἦ καὶ δύναιο ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ἐν τῷ παρόντι νῦν εὑρεῖν ὅτῳ ἂν χαρίσαιο ὅσαπερ τῷ ἐμῷ πατρί ;
But, Cyrus, said he, as things now are, could you find any one to whom you could do as great favours as you can to my father?


3.1.29
1296
αὐτίκα , ἔφη , ἤν τινα ἐᾷς ζῆν τῶν σε μηδὲν ἠδικηκότων , τίνα σοι τούτου χάριν οἴει αὐτὸν εἴσεσθαι ;
For example, if you grant any one of those who have done you no wrong his life, what gratitude do you think he will feel toward you for that?


3.1.29
1297
τί δ’ , ἢν αὐτοῦ τέκνα καὶ γυναῖκα μὴ ἀφαιρῇ , τίς σε τούτου ἕνεκα φιλήσει μᾶλλον ἢ ὁ νομίζων προσήκειν αὑτῷ ἀφαιρεθῆναι ;
And again, who will love you for not depriving him of his wife and children more than he who thinks that it would serve him right to lose them?


3.1.29
1298
τὴν δ’ Ἀρμενίων βασιλείαν εἰ μὴ ἕξει , οἶσθά τινα , ἔφη , λυπούμενον μᾶλλον ἢ ἡμᾶς ;
And do you know of any one who would be more grieved than we, not to have the throne of Armenia?


3.1.29
1299
οὐκοῦν καὶ τοῦτ’ , ἔφη , δῆλον ὅτι ὁ μάλιστα λυπούμενος εἰ μὴ βασιλεὺς εἴη οὗτος καὶ λαβὼν τὴν ἀρχὴν μεγίστην ἄν σοι χάριν εἰδείη .
Well, then, he added, it is evident that he who would be most grieved not to be king, would also be most grateful for receiving the throne.


3.1.30
1300
εἰ δέ τί σοι , ἔφη , μέλει καὶ τοῦ ὡς ἥκιστα τεταραγμένα τάδε καταλιπεῖν , ὅταν ἀπίῃς , σκόπει , ἔφη , πότερον ἂν οἴει ἠρεμεστέρως ἔχειν τὰ ἐνθάδε καινῆς γενομένης ἀρχῆς ἢ τῆς εἰωθυίας καταμενούσης ·
And if you care at all to leave matters here in as little confusion as possible when you go away, consider whether you think the country would be more tranquil under the beginning of a new administration than if the one we are used to should continue.


3.1.30
1301
εἰ δέ τί σοι μέλει καὶ τοῦ ὡς πλείστην στρατιὰν ἐξάγειν , τίν’ ἂν οἴει μᾶλλον ἐξετάσαι ταύτην ὀρθῶς τοῦ πολλάκις αὐτῇ κεχρημένου ;
And if you care to take with you as large an army as possible, who do you think would be in a better position to organize the troops properly than he who has often employed them?


3.1.30
1302
εἰ δὲ καὶ χρημάτων δεήσει , τίν’ ἂν ταῦτα νομίζεις κρεῖττον ἐκπορίσαι τοῦ καὶ εἰδότος καὶ ἔχοντος πάντα τὰ ὄντα ;
And if you need money also, who do you think could supply it better than he who knows and commands all the sources of supply?


3.1.30
1303
ὠγαθέ , ἔφη , Κῦρε , φύλαξαι μὴ ἡμᾶς ἀποβαλὼν σαυτὸν ζημιώσῃς πλείω ἢ ὁ πατὴρ ἐδυνήθη σε βλάψαι .
My good Cyrus , he added, beware lest in casting us aside you do yourself a greater injury than any harm my father has been able to do you.


3.1.30
1304
ὁ μὲν τοιαῦτα ἔλεγεν .
Thus he spoke.


3.1.31
1305
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἀκούων ὑπερήδετο , ὅτι ἐνόμιζε περαίνεσθαι πάντα αὐτῷ ὅσαπερ ὑπέσχετο τῷ Κυαξάρῃ πράξειν ;
And Cyrus was more than pleased at hearing him, for he thought that everything that he had promised Cyaxares to do was in course of accomplishment;


3.1.31
1306
ἐμέμνητο γὰρ εἰπὼν ὅτι καὶ φίλον οἴοιτο μᾶλλον ἢ πρόσθεν ποιήσειν .
for he remembered having told him that he would make the Armenian more his friend than he was before.


3.1.31
1307
καὶ ἐκ τούτου δὴ τὸν Ἀρμένιον ἐρωτᾷ ·
Tell me, king of Armenia , he therefore asked,


3.1.31
1308
ἢν δὲ δὴ ταῦτα πείθωμαι ὑμῖν , λέγε μοι , ἔφη , σύ , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , πόσην μὲν στρατιάν μοι συμπέμψεις , πόσα δὲ χρήματα συμβαλῇ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον ;
if I yield to you in this matter, how large an army will you send with me and how much money will you contribute to the war?


3.1.32
1309
πρὸς ταῦτα δὴ λέγει ὁ Ἀρμένιος ·
I have nothing to propose more simple or more fair, Cyrus , the Armenian replied to this,


3.1.32
1310
οὐδὲν ἔχω , ὦ Κῦρε , ἔφη , ἁπλούστερον εἰπεῖν οὐδὲ δικαιότερον ἢ δεῖξαι μὲν ἐμὲ πᾶσαν τὴν οὖσαν δύναμιν , σὲ δὲ ἰδόντα ὅσην μὲν ἄν σοι δοκῇ στρατιὰν ἄγειν , τὴν δὲ καταλιπεῖν τῆς χώρας φυλακήν .
than for me to show you all the forces I have and for you, when you have seen them, to take as many as you see fit, leaving the rest here to protect the country.


3.1.32
1311
ὡς δ’ αὔτως περὶ χρημάτων δηλῶσαι μὲν ἐμὲ δίκαιόν σοι πάντα τὰ ὄντα , σὲ δὲ τούτων αὐτὸν γνόντα ὁπόσα τε ἂν βούλῃ φέρεσθαι καὶ ὁπόσα ἂν βούλῃ καταλιπεῖν .
And in the same way in regard to the money, it is proper for me to show you all that I have, and for you to decide for yourself and take as much as you please and to leave as much as you please.


3.1.33
1312
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Come then, said Cyrus ,


3.1.33
1313
ἴθι δὴ λέξον μοι πόση σοι δύναμίς ἐστι , λέξον δὲ καὶ πόσα χρήματα .
tell me how large your forces are and how much money you have.


3.1.33
1314
ἐνταῦθα δὴ λέγει ὁ Ἀρμένιος ·
Well, the Armenian then answered,


3.1.33
1315
ἱππεῖς μὲν τοίνυν εἰσὶν Ἀρμενίων εἰς ὀκτακισχιλίους , πεζοὶ δὲ εἰς τέτταρας μυριάδας ·
there are about eight thousand cavalry and about forty thousand infantry.


3.1.33
1316
χρήματα δ’ , ἔφη , σὺν τοῖς θησαυροῖς οἷς ὁ πατὴρ κατέλιπεν ἔστιν εἰς ἀργύριον λογισθέντα τάλαντα πλείω τῶν τρισχιλίων .
And the property, said he, including the treasures that my father left me, amounts, when reduced to cash, to more than three thousand talents.


3.1.34
1317
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος οὐκ ἐμέλλησεν , ἀλλ’ εἶπε ·
And without hesitation, Cyrus replied:


3.1.34
1318
τῆς μὲν τοίνυν στρατιᾶς , ἐπεί σοι , ἔφη , οἱ ὅμοροι Χαλδαῖοι πολεμοῦσι , τοὺς ἡμίσεις μοι σύμπεμπε ·
Send with me then, said he, only half the army, since your neighbours, the Chaldaeans, are at war with you.


3.1.34
1319
τῶν δὲ χρημάτων ἀντὶ μὲν τῶν πεντήκοντα ταλάντων ὧν ἔφερες δασμὸν διπλάσια Κυαξάρῃ ἀπόδος , ὅτι ἔλιπες τὴν φοράν ·
And of the money, instead of the fifty talents which you used to pay as tribute, pay Cyaxares double that sum because you are in arrears with your payments.


3.1.34
1320
ἐμοὶ δ’ , ἔφη , ἄλλα ἑκατὸν δάνεισον ·
And lend me personally a hundred more, said he;


3.1.34
1321
ἐγὼ δέ σοι ὑπισχνοῦμαι , ἢν ὁ θεὸς εὖ διδῷ , ἀνθ’ ὧν ἂν ἐμοὶ δανείσῃς ἢ ἄλλα πλείονος ἄξια εὐεργετήσειν ἢ τὰ χρήματα ἀπαριθμήσειν , ἢν δύνωμαι ·
and I promise you that if God prospers me, I will in return for your loan either do you other favours worth more than that amount or at least pay you back the money, if I can;


3.1.34
1322
ἢν δὲ μὴ δύνωμαι , ἀδύνατος ἂν φαινοίμην , οἶμαι , ἄδικος δ’ οὐκ ἂν δικαίως κρινοίμην .
but if I cannot, I may seem insolvent, I suppose, but I should not justly be accounted dishonest.


3.1.35
1323
καὶ ὁ Ἀρμένιος , πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , μὴ οὕτω λέγε ·
For heaven’s sake, Cyrus , said the Armenian, do not talk that way.


3.1.35
1324
εἰ δὲ μή , οὐ θαρροῦντά με ἕξεις ·
If you do, you will make me lose heart.


3.1.35
1325
ἀλλὰ νόμιζε , ἔφη , ἃ ἂν καταλίπῃς μηδὲν ἧττον σὰ εἶναι ὧν ἂν ἔχων ἀπίῃς .
But consider, said he, that what you leave here is no less yours than what you take away.


3.1.35
1326
εἶεν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος ·
Very well, said Cyrus ;


3.1.35
1327
ὥστε δὲ τὴν γυναῖκα ἀπολαβεῖν , ἔφη , πόσα ἄν μοι χρήματα δοίης ;
now how much money would you give to get your wife back?


3.1.35
1328
ὁπόσα ἂν δυναίμην , ἔφη .
As much as I could, said he.


3.1.35
1329
τί δέ , ὥστε τοὺς παῖδας ;
And how much to get your children?


3.1.35
1330
καὶ τούτων , ἔφη , ὁπόσα ἂν δυναίμην .
For these also, said he, as much as I could.


3.1.35
1331
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ταῦτα μὲν ἤδη διπλάσια τῶν ὄντων .
Well then, said Cyrus , that makes already twice as much as you have.


3.1.36
1332
σὺ δέ , ἔφη , ὦ Τιγράνη , λέξον μοι πόσου ἂν πρίαιο ὥστε τὴν γυναῖκα ἀπολαβεῖν .
And you, Tigranes, said he, tell me how much you would pay to get your wife back?


3.1.36
1333
ὁ δὲ ἐτύγχανε νεόγαμός τε ὢν καὶ ὑπερφιλῶν τὴν γυναῖκα .
Now it happened that he was newly married and loved his wife very dearly.


3.1.36
1334
ἐγὼ μέν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , κἂν τῆς ψυχῆς πριαίμην ὥστε μήποτε λατρεῦσαι ταύτην .
I would give my life, Cyrus, said he, to keep her from slavery.


3.1.37
1335
σὺ μὲν τοίνυν , ἔφη , ἀπάγου τὴν σήν ·
Well then, said he, take her back; she is your own.


3.1.37
1336
οὐδὲ γὰρ εἰλῆφθαι ἔγωγε αἰχμάλωτον ταύτην νομίζω σοῦ γε μηπώποτε φυγόντος ἡμᾶς .
For I, for my part, do not consider that she has been made a prisoner of war at all, since you never ran away from us.


3.1.37
1337
καὶ σὺ δέ , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , ἀπάγου τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τοὺς παῖδας μηδὲν αὐτῶν καταθείς , ἵν’ εἰδῶσιν ὅτι ἐλεύθεροι πρὸς σὲ ἀπέρχονται .
And you too, king of Armenia, may take back your wife and children without paying any ransom for them, that they may know that they return to you free men and women.


3.1.37
1338
καὶ νῦν μέν , ἔφη , δειπνεῖτε παρ’ ἡμῖν ·
And now, said he, stay and have dinner with us;


3.1.37
1339
δειπνήσαντες δὲ ἀπελαύνετε ὅποι ὑμῖν θυμός .
and when you have dined you may drive away wherever you have a mind to go.


3.1.37
1340
οὕτω δὴ κατέμειναν .
So they stayed.


3.1.38
1341
διασκηνούντων δὲ μετὰ δεῖπνον ἐπήρετο ὁ Κῦρος ·
And after dinner, as the party was breaking up, Cyrus asked:


3.1.38
1342
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Τιγράνη , ποῦ δὴ ἐκεῖνός ἐστιν ὁ ἀνὴρ ὃς συνεθήρα ἡμῖν καὶ σύ μοι μάλα ἐδόκεις θαυμάζειν αὐτόν .
Tell me, Tigranes, where is the man who used to hunt with us? You seemed to admire him very much.


3.1.38
1343
οὐ γάρ , ἔφη , ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν οὑτοσὶ ὁ ἐμὸς πατήρ ;
Ah, he replied, did not my father here have him put to death?


3.1.38
1344
τί λαβὼν ἀδικοῦντα ;
What wrong did he find him doing?


3.1.38
1345
διαφθείρειν αὐτὸν ἔφη ἐμέ .
He said that he was corrupting me.


3.1.38
1346
καίτοι γ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , οὕτω καλὸς κ- ἀγαθὸς ἐκεῖνος ἦν ὡς καὶ ὅτε ἀποθνῄσκειν ἔμελλε προσκαλέσας με εἶπε ·
And yet, Cyrus, said he, he was so noble and so good that when he was about to be put to death, he called me to him and said:


3.1.38
1347
μήτι σύ , ἔφη , ὦ Τιγράνη , ὅτι ἀποκτείνει με , χαλεπανθῇς τῷ πατρί ·
Be not angry with your father, Tigranes, for putting me to death;


3.1.38
1348
οὐ γὰρ κακονοίᾳ τῇ σῇ τοῦτο ποιεῖ , ἀλλ’ ἀγνοίᾳ .
for he does it, not from any spirit of malice, but from ignorance,


3.1.38
1349
ὁπόσα δὲ ἀγνοίᾳ ἄνθρωποι ἐξαμαρτάνουσι , πάντ’ ἀκούσια ταῦτ’ ἔγωγε νομίζω .
and when men do wrong from ignorance, I believe they do it quite against their will.


3.1.39
1350
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κῦρος ἐπὶ τούτοις εἶπε ·
Poor man! Cyrus exclaimed on hearing this.


3.1.39
1351
φεῦ τοῦ ἀνδρός .
Here the Armenian king interrupted:


3.1.39
1352
ὁ δ’ Ἀρμένιος ἔλεξεν ·
Do not men who discover strangers in intercourse with their wives kill them, not on the ground that they make their wives more inclined to folly,


3.1.39
1353
οὔτοι , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , οὐδ’ οἱ ταῖς ἑαυτῶν γυναιξὶ λαμβάνοντες συνόντας ἀλλοτρίους ἄνδρας οὐ τοῦτο αἰτιώμενοι αὐτοὺς κατακαίνουσιν ὡς ἀμαθεστέρας ποιοῦντας τὰς γυναῖκας , ἀλλὰ νομίζοντες ἀφαιρεῖσθαι αὐτοὺς τὴν πρὸς αὑτοὺς φιλίαν , διὰ τοῦτο ὡς πολεμίοις αὐτοῖς χρῶνται .
but in the belief that they alienate from them their wives’ affections — for this reason they treat them as enemies.


3.1.39
1354
καὶ ἐγὼ ἐκείνῳ , ἔφη , ἐφθόνουν , ὅτι μοι ἐδόκει τοῦτον ποιεῖν αὐτὸν μᾶλλον θαυμάζειν ἢ ἐμέ .
So I was jealous of him because I thought that he made my son regard him more highly than he did me.


3.1.40
1355
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Well, by the gods, king of Armenia, said Cyrus, your sin seems human;


3.1.40
1356
ἀλλὰ ναὶ μὰ τοὺς θεούς , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , ἀνθρώπινά μοι δοκεῖς ἁμαρτεῖν ·
and you, Tigranes, must forgive your father.


3.1.40
1357
καὶ σύ , ὦ Τιγράνη , συγγίγνωσκε τῷ πατρί .
Then when they had thus conversed and showed their friendly feelings toward one another, as was natural after a reconciliation,


3.1.40
1358
τότε μὲν δὴ τοιαῦτα διαλεχθέντες καὶ φιλοφρονηθέντες ὥσπερ εἰκὸς ἐκ συναλλαγῆς , ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τὰς ἁρμαμάξας σὺν ταῖς γυναιξὶν ἀπήλαυνον εὐφραινόμενοι .
they entered their carriages and drove away with their wives, happy.


3.1.41
1359
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἦλθον οἴκαδε , ἔλεγον τοῦ Κύρου ὁ μέν τις τὴν σοφίαν , ὁ δὲ τὴν καρτερίαν , ὁ δὲ τὴν πρᾳότητα , ὁ δέ τις καὶ τὸ κάλλος καὶ τὸ μέγεθος .
And when they got home they talked, one of Cyrus’s wisdom, another of his strength, another of his gentleness, and still another of his beauty and his commanding presence.


3.1.41
1360
ἔνθα δὴ ὁ Τιγράνης ἐπήρετο τὴν γυναῖκα ·
Then Tigranes asked his wife:


3.1.41
1361
ἦ καὶ σοί , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρμενία , καλὸς ἐδόκει ὁ Κῦρος εἶναι ;
Tell me, my Armenian princess, said he, did you, too, think Cyrus handsome?


3.1.41
1362
ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐκ ἐκεῖνον ἐθεώμην .
Why, by Zeus, said she, I did not look at him.


3.1.41
1363
ἀλλὰ τίνα μήν ;
At whom, then?


3.1.41
1364
ἔφη ὁ Τιγράνης .
asked Tigranes.


3.1.41
1365
τὸν εἰπόντα νὴ Δία ὡς τῆς αὑτοῦ ψυχῆς ἂν πρίαιτο ὥστε μή με δουλεύειν .
At him, by Zeus, who said that he would give his life to keep me from servitude.


3.1.41
1366
τότε μὲν δὴ ὥσπερ εἰκὸς ἐκ τοιούτων ἀνεπαύοντο σὺν ἀλλήλοις .
Then as might be expected after such experiences, they went to rest together.


3.1.42
1367
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ὁ Ἀρμένιος Κύρῳ μὲν καὶ τῇ στρατιᾷ ἁπάσῃ ξένια ἔπεμπε , προεῖπε δὲ τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ , οὓς δεήσοι στρατεύεσθαι .
And on the following day the Armenian king sent guest-presents to Cyrus and all his army, and he commanded those of his men who were to take the field


3.1.42
1368
εἰς τρίτην ἡμέραν παρεῖναι ·
to present themselves on the third day;


3.1.42
1369
τὰ δὲ χρήματα ὧν εἶπεν ὁ Κῦρος διπλάσια ἀπηρίθμησεν .
and he paid Cyrus double the sum of money that he had named.


3.1.42
1370
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὅσα εἶπε λαβὼν τ- ἄλλα ἀπέπεμψεν ·
But Cyrus accepted only the amount specified and returned the rest.


3.1.42
1371
ἤρετο δὲ πότερος ἔσται ὁ τὸ στράτευμα ἄγων , ὁ παῖς ἢ αὐτός .
Then he asked which of the two was to go in command of the forces, the king himself or his son.


3.1.42
1372
εἰπέτην δὲ ἅμα ὁ μὲν πατὴρ οὕτως ·
They both answered at the same instant, the father saying:


3.1.42
1373
ὁπότερον ἂν σὺ κελεύῃς ·
Whichever you command;


3.1.42
1374
ὁ δὲ παῖς οὕτως ·
and the son:


3.1.42
1375
ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ ἀπολείψομαί σου , ὦ Κῦρε , οὐδ’ ἂν σκευοφόρον ἐμὲ δίῃ σοι συνακολουθεῖν .
I will never leave you, Cyrus, not even if I have to accompany you as a camp-follower.


3.1.43
1376
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἐπιγελάσας εἶπε ·
And Cyrus, laughing, said:


3.1.43
1377
καὶ ἐπὶ πόσῳ ἄν , ἔφη , ἐθέλοις τὴν γυναῖκά σου ἀκοῦσαι ὅτι σκευοφορεῖς ;
How much would you take to have your wife told that you were a camp-follower?


3.1.43
1378
ἀλλ’ οὐδέν , ἔφη , ἀκούειν δεήσει αὐτήν ·
Why, said he, she will not need to be told anything about it;


3.1.43
1379
ἄξω γάρ , ὥστε ὁρᾶν ἐξέσται αὐτῇ ὅ τι ἂν ἐγὼ πράττω .
for I shall take her with me, so that she will be in a position to see whatever I do.


3.1.43
1380
ὥρα ἄν , ἔφη , συσκευάζεσθαι ὑμῖν εἴη .
Then, said he, it may be high time for you to be getting your things together.


3.1.43
1381
νόμιζ’ , ἔφη , συνεσκευασμένους παρέσεσθαι ὅ τι ἂν ὁ πατὴρ δῷ .
Be sure, said he, that we shall be here with everything brought together that my father gives us.


3.1.43
1382
τότε μὲν δὴ ξενισθέντες οἱ στρατιῶται ἐκοιμήθησαν .
And when the soldiers had received their presents they went to bed.


3.2.1
1383
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἀναλαβὼν ὁ Κῦρος τὸν Τιγράνην καὶ τῶν Μήδων ἱππέων τοὺς κρατίστους καὶ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ φίλων ὁπόσους καιρὸς ἐδόκει εἶναι , περιελαύνων τὴν χώραν κατεθεᾶτο , σκοπῶν ποῦ τειχίσειε φρούριον .
On the morrow Cyrus took with him Tigranes, the best of the Median horsemen, and as many of his own friends as he thought proper, and rode around to inspect the country with a view to finding a place in which to build a fort.


3.2.1
1384
καὶ ἐπ’ ἄκρον τι ἐλθὼν ἐπηρώτα τὸν Τιγράνην ποῖα εἴη τῶν ὀρέων ὁπόθεν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι καταθέοντες λῄζονται .
And when he had come to a certain eminence he asked Tigranes which were the mountains from which the Chaldaeans were accustomed to descend to make forays into the country.


3.2.1
1385
καὶ ὁ Τιγράνης ἐδείκνυεν .
And Tigranes pointed them out.


3.2.1
1386
ὁ δὲ πάλιν ἤρετο ·
And again he asked:


3.2.1
1387
νῦν δὲ ταῦτα τὰ ὄρη ἔρημά ἐστιν ;
And are these mountains now unoccupied?


3.2.1
1388
οὐ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ἀλλ’ ἀεὶ σκοποὶ εἰσὶν ἐκείνων οἳ σημαίνουσι τοῖς ἄλλοις ὅ τι ἂν ὁρῶσι .
No, by Zeus, said he; but they always have scouts up there who signal to the rest whatever they see.


3.2.1
1389
τί οὖν , ἔφη , ποιοῦσιν , ἐπὴν αἴσθωνται ;
Then said he, what do they do, when they receive the signals?


3.2.1
1390
βοηθοῦσιν , ἔφη , ἐπὶ τὰ ἄκρα , ὡς ἂν ἕκαστος δύνηται .
They run out to the heights to help, said he, each as best he can.


3.2.2
1391
ταῦτα μὲν δὴ ὁ Κῦρος ἠκηκόει ·
Such was the account to which Cyrus listened;


3.2.2
1392
σκοπῶν δὲ κατενόει πολλὴν τῆς χώρας τοῖς Ἀρμενίοις ἔρημον καὶ ἀργὸν οὖσαν διὰ τὸν πόλεμον .
and as he looked he observed that a large portion of the Armenians’ country was deserted and uncultivated as a result of the war.


3.2.2
1393
καὶ τότε μὲν ἀπῆλθον ἐπὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ δειπνήσαντες ἐκοιμήθησαν .
And then they went back to camp and after they had dined they went to rest.


3.2.3
1394
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ αὐτός τε ὁ Τιγράνης παρῆν συνεσκευασμένος καὶ ἱππεῖς εἰς τοὺς τετρακισχιλίους συνελέγοντο αὐτῷ καὶ τοξόται εἰς τοὺς μυρίους , καὶ πελτασταὶ ἄλλοι τοσοῦτοι .
On the following day Tigranes presented himself with his baggage all ready for the start; and under his command were assembled about four thousand horsemen and about ten thousand bowmen and as many peltasts besides.


3.2.3
1395
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐν ᾧ συνελέγοντο ἐθύετο ·
While they had been coming together, Cyrus had been sacrificing;


3.2.3
1396
ἐπεὶ δὲ καλὰ τὰ ἱερὰ ἦν αὐτῷ , συνεκάλεσε τούς τε τῶν Περσῶν ἡγεμόνας καὶ τοὺς τῶν Μήδων .
and when his sacrifice gave favorable omens, he called a meeting of the officers of the Persians and of the Medes;


3.2.4
1397
ἐπεὶ δ’ ὁμοῦ ἦσαν , ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
and when they were come together, he spoke as follows:


3.2.4
1398
ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἔστι μὲν τὰ ὄρη ταῦτα ἃ ὁρῶμεν Χαλδαίων ·
My friends, these mountains which we see belong to Chaldaea;


3.2.4
1399
εἰ δὲ ταῦτα καταλάβοιμεν καὶ ἐπ’ ἄκρου γένοιτο ἡμέτερον φρούριον , σωφρονεῖν ἀνάγκη ἂν εἴη πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀμφοτέροις , τοῖς τε Ἀρμενίοις καὶ τοῖς Χαλδαίοις .
but if we should seize them and have a fort of our own built upon the summit, both parties — the Armenians, I mean, and the Chaldaeans — would have to behave with discretion toward us.


3.2.4
1400
τὰ μὲν οὖν ἱερὰ καλὰ ἡμῖν ·
Now, the sacrifices give us favorable omens;


3.2.4
1401
ἀνθρωπίνῃ δὲ προθυμίᾳ εἰς τὸ πραχθῆναι ταῦτα οὐδὲν οὕτω μέγα σύμμαχον ἂν γένοιτο ὡς τάχος .
but, for the execution of our plan, nothing would be so strong an ally to human zeal as dispatch.


3.2.4
1402
ἢν γὰρ φθάσωμεν πρὶν τοὺς πολεμίους συλλεγῆναι ἀναβάντες , ἢ παντάπασιν ἀμαχεὶ λάβοιμεν ἂν τὸ ἄκρον ἢ ὀλίγοις τε καὶ ἀσθενέσι χρησαίμεθ’ ἂν πολεμίοις .
For if we get up there before the enemy have time to come together, we may gain possession of the heights altogether without a battle, or we may at least find enemies few in number and without strength.


3.2.5
1403
τῶν οὖν πόνων οὐδεὶς ῥᾴων οὐδ’ ἀκινδυνότερος , ἔφη , ἐστὶ τοῦ νῦν καρτερῆσαι σπεύδοντας .
Of the tasks before us, therefore, none is easier or less fraught with danger, said he, than now bravely to endure the strain of haste.


3.2.5
1404
ἴτε οὖν ἐπὶ τὰ ὅπλα .
Therefore, to arms!


3.2.5
1405
καὶ G? ὑμεῖς μέν , ὦ Μῆδοι , ἐν ἀριστερᾷ ἡμῶν πορεύεσθε ·
And you, Medes, march on our left;


3.2.5
1406
ὑμεῖς δέ , ὦ Ἀρμένιοι , οἱ μὲν ἡμίσεις ἐν δεξιᾷ , οἱ δ’ ἡμίσεις ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν ἡγεῖσθε ·
and you, Armenians, half keep to our right and half lead on in front;


3.2.5
1407
ὑμεῖς δ’ , ὦ ἱππεῖς , ὄπισθεν ἕπεσθε παρακελευόμενοι καὶ ὠθοῦντες ἄνω ἡμᾶς , ἢν δέ τις μαλακύνηται , μὴ ἐπιτρέπετε .
while you, cavalrymen, shall follow behind, to encourage and push us on upward; and if any one is inclined to show weakness, do not allow it.


3.2.6
1408
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν ὁ Κῦρος ἡγεῖτο ὀρθίους ποιησάμενος τοὺς λόχους .
With this command Cyrus brought his companies to ploy into column and took his place at their head.


3.2.6
1409
οἱ δὲ Χαλδαῖοι ὡς ἔγνωσαν τὴν ὁρμὴν ἄνω οὖσαν , εὐθὺς ἐσήμαινόν τε τοῖς ἑαυτῶν καὶ συνεβόων ἀλλήλους καὶ συνηθροίζοντο .
And when the Chaldaeans realized that the movement was directed toward the heights, they immediately gave the signal to their people, called to one another to assemble, and began to come together.


3.2.6
1410
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος παρηγγύα , ἄνδρες Πέρσαι , ἡμῖν σημαίνουσι σπεύδειν .
And Cyrus gave command:  Fellow-Persians, they are signalling us to hasten;


3.2.6
1411
ἢν γὰρ φθάσωμεν ἄνω γενόμενοι , οὐδὲν τὰ τῶν πολεμίων δυνήσεται .
for if we get up there first, the enemy’s efforts will be of no avail.


3.2.7
1412
εἶχον δ’ οἱ Χαλδαῖοι γέρρα τε καὶ παλτὰ δύο ·
Now the Chaldaeans carried each a wicker shield and two spears,


3.2.7
1413
καὶ πολεμικώτατοι δὲ λέγονται οὗτοι τῶν περὶ ἐκείνην τὴν χώραν εἶναι ·
and they were said to be the most warlike of the peoples in that region.


3.2.7
1414
καὶ μισθοῦ στρατεύονται , ὁπόταν τις αὐτῶν δέηται , διὰ τὸ πολεμικοί τε καὶ πένητες εἶναι ·
They also serve for hire when any one wants them, for they are fond of war and poor of purse;


3.2.7
1415
καὶ γὰρ ἡ χώρα αὐτοῖς ὀρεινή τέ ἐστι καὶ ὀλίγη ἡ τὰ χρήματα ἔχουσα .
for their country is mountainous and only a small part of it is productive.


3.2.8
1416
ὡς δὲ μᾶλλον ἐπλησίαζον οἱ ἀμφὶ τὸν Κῦρον τῶν ἄκρων , ὁ Τιγράνης σὺν τῷ Κύρῳ πορευόμενος εἶπεν ·
But when Cyrus and his men were getting nearer to the heights, Tigranes, who was marching with Cyrus, said:


3.2.8
1417
ὦ Κῦρε , ἆρ’ οἶσθ’ , ἔφη , ὅτι αὐτοὺς ἡμᾶς αὐτίκα μάλα δεήσει μάχεσθαι ;
Do you know, Cyrus, that we ourselves shall have to do the fighting, and in a very few moments?


3.2.8
1418
ὡς οἵ γε Ἀρμένιοι οὐ μὴ δέξονται τοὺς πολεμίους .
For the Armenians, I am sure, will never sustain the enemy’s attack.


3.2.8
1419
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἰπὼν ὅτι εἰδείη τοῦτο , εὐθὺς παρηγγύησε τοῖς Πέρσαις παρασκευάζεσθαι , ὡς αὐτίκα δεῆσον διώκειν , ἐπειδὰν ὑπαγάγωσι τοὺς πολεμίους ὑποφεύγοντες οἱ Ἀρμένιοι ὥστ’ ἐγγὺς ἡμῖν γενέσθαι .
Cyrus answered that he knew that and gave the command to the Persians to make ready, as it would be necessary in a moment to give chase, as soon as the Armenians by pretending flight should decoy the enemy into close quarters.


3.2.9
1420
οὕτω δὴ ἡγοῦντο μὲν οἱ Ἀρμένιοι ·
So the Armenians led on.


3.2.9
1421
τῶν δὲ Χαλδαιών οἱ παρόντες , ὡς ἐπλησίαζον οἱ Ἀρμένιοι , ἀλαλάξαντες ἔθεον , ὥσπερ εἰώθεσαν , εἰς αὐτούς ·
And when they came near, the Chaldaeans already there raised the battle cry, according to their custom, and charged upon them.


3.2.9
1422
οἱ δὲ Ἀρμένιοι , ὥσπερ εἰώθεσαν , οὐκ ἐδέχοντο .
And the Armenians, according to their custom, failed to sustain the charge.


3.2.10
1423
ὡς δὲ διώκοντες οἱ Χαλδαῖοι εἶδον ἐναντίους μαχαιροφόρους ἱεμένους ἄνω , οἱ μέν τινες αὐτοῖς πελάσαντες ταχὺ ἀπέθνῃσκον , οἱ δ’ ἔφευγον , οἱ δέ τινες καὶ ἑάλωσαν αὐτῶν , ταχὺ δὲ εἴχετο τὰ ἄκρα .
But when the Chaldaeans in pursuit saw before them the swordsmen rushing up against them, some came near and were cut down at once, others fled, and some others of their number were taken prisoners; and soon the heights were taken.


3.2.10
1424
ἐπεὶ δὲ τὰ ἄκρα εἶχον οἱ ἀμφὶ τὸν Κῦρον , καθεώρων τε τῶν Χαλδαίων τὰς οἰκήσεις καὶ ᾐσθάνοντο φεύγοντας αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν ἐγγὺς οἰκήσεων .
And when Cyrus and his men were in possession of the heights, they looked down on the dwellings of the Chaldaeans and saw the people fleeing from their homes near by.


3.2.11
1425
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος , ὡς πάντες οἱ στρατιῶται ὁμοῦ ἐγένοντο , ἀριστοποιεῖσθαι παρήγγειλεν .
Then when the soldiers were all together, Cyrus bade his men take luncheon;


3.2.11
1426
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠριστήκεσαν , καταμαθὼν ἔνθα αἱ σκοπαὶ ἦσαν αἱ τῶν Χαλδαίων ἐρυμνόν τε ὂν καὶ ἔνυδρον , εὐθὺς ἐτείχιζε φρούριον ·
and when they had lunched and he had discovered that the place where the scouts had their posts of observation was strong and well supplied with water, he at once proceeded to build a fort there.


3.2.11
1427
καὶ τὸν Τιγράνην ἐκέλευε πέμπειν ἐπὶ τὸν πατέρα καὶ κελεύειν παραγενέσθαι ἔχοντα ὁπόσοι εἶεν τέκτονές τε καὶ λιθοτόμοι .
He also bade Tigranes send for his father and bid him come with all the carpenters and masons that he had.


3.2.11
1428
ἐπὶ μὲν δὴ τὸν Ἀρμένιον ᾤχετο ἄγγελος ·
So a messenger was off to bring the Armenian king,


3.2.11
1429
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τοῖς παροῦσιν ἐτείχιζεν .
but Cyrus proceeded to build the wall with the men he had at hand.


3.2.12
1430
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ προσάγουσι τῷ Κύρῳ τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους δεδεμένους , τοὺς δέ τινας καὶ τετρωμένους .
At this juncture they brought to Cyrus the prisoners in chains and also some that had been wounded.


3.2.12
1431
ὡς δὲ εἶδεν , εὐθὺς λύειν μὲν ἐκέλευσε τοὺς δεδεμένους , τοὺς δὲ τετρωμένους ἰατροὺς καλέσας θεραπεύειν ἐκέλευσεν ·
And when he saw them he at once ordered that the fetters be taken off, and he sent for surgeons and bade them attend to the wounded men.


3.2.12
1432
ἔπειτα δὲ ἔλεξε τοῖς Χαλδαίοις ὅτι ἥκοι οὔτε ἀπολέσαι ἐπιθυμῶν ἐκείνους οὔτε πολεμεῖν δεόμενος , ἀλλ’ εἰρήνην βουλόμενος ποιῆσαι Ἀρμενίοις καὶ Χαλδαίοις .
And then he told the Chaldaeans that he had come with no wish to destroy them and with no desire to make war, but because he wished to make peace between the Armenians and the Chaldaeans.


3.2.12
1433
πρὶν μὲν οὖν ἔχεσθαι τὰ ἄκρα οἶδ’ ὅτι οὐδὲν ἐδεῖσθε εἰρήνης ·
Now I know that before the heights were taken you had no wish at all for peace,


3.2.12
1434
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ὑμέτερα ἀσφαλῶς εἶχε , τὰ δὲ τῶν Ἀρμενίων ἤγετε καὶ ἐφέρετε ·
for everything of yours was secure, while you carried off and plundered the property of the Armenians;


3.2.12
1435
νῦν δὲ ὁρᾶτε δὴ ἐν οἵῳ ἐστέ .
but now see in what a predicament you are!


3.2.13
1436
ἐγὼ οὖν ἀφίημι ὑμᾶς οἴκαδε τοὺς εἰλημμένους , καὶ δίδωμι ὑμῖν σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις Χαλδαίοις βουλεύσασθαι εἴτε βούλεσθε πολεμεῖν ἡμῖν εἴτε φίλοι εἶναι .
Now I am going to let you who have been captured go home and consult with the rest of the Chaldaeans whether you wish to have war with us or to be our friends.


3.2.13
1437
καὶ ἢν μὲν πόλεμον αἱρῆσθε , μηκέτι ἥκετε δεῦρο ἄνευ ὅπλων , εἰ σωφρονεῖτε ·
And if you choose war, do not come this way again without weapons, if you are wise;


3.2.13
1438
ἢν δὲ εἰρήνης δοκῆτε δεῖσθαι , ἄνευ ὅπλων ἥκετε ·
but if you decide that you desire peace, come without arms.


3.2.13
1439
ὡς δὲ καλῶς ἕξει τὰ ὑμέτερα , ἢν φίλοι γένησθε , ἐμοὶ μελήσει .
I shall see to it that you have no cause to complain, if you become our friends.


3.2.14
1440
ἀκούσαντες δὲ ταῦτα οἱ Χαλδαῖοι , πολλὰ μὲν ἐπαινέσαντες , πολλὰ δὲ δεξιωσάμενοι τὸν Κῦρον ᾤχοντο οἴκαδε .
And when the Chaldaeans heard this, they commended Cyrus highly, shook hands with him heartily, and departed for home.


3.2.14
1441
ὁ δὲ Ἀρμένιος ὡς ἤκουσε τήν τε κλῆσιν τοῦ Κύρου καὶ τὴν πρᾶξιν , λαβὼν τοὺς τέκτονας καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὅσων ᾤετο δεῖν , ἧκε πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον ὡς ἐδύνατο τάχιστα .
Now, when the king of Armenia received Cyrus’s summons and heard of his plans, he came to Cyrus as quickly as he could with the carpenters and all that he thought was necessary.


3.2.15
1442
ἐπεὶ δὲ εἶδε τὸν Κῦρον , ἔλεξεν ·
And when he saw Cyrus, he said:


3.2.15
1443
ὦ Κῦρε , ὡς ὀλίγα δυνάμενοι προορᾶν ἅνθρωποι περὶ τοῦ μέλλοντος πολλὰ ἐπιχειροῦμεν πράττειν .
How little of the future, Cyrus, we mortals can foresee, and yet how much we try to accomplish.


3.2.15
1444
νῦν γὰρ δὴ καὶ ἐγὼ ἐλευθερίαν μὲν μηχανᾶσθαι ἐπιχειρήσας δοῦλος ὡς οὐδεπώποτε ἐγενόμην ·
Why, just now, when I was striving to secure liberty, I became more a slave than ever before;


3.2.15
1445
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἑάλωμεν , σαφῶς ἀπολωλέναι νομίσαντες νῦν ἀναφαινόμεθα σεσωσμένοι ὡς οὐδεπώποτε .
and when we were taken prisoners, we then thought our destruction certain, but we now find that we are saved as never before.


3.2.15
1446
οἳ γὰρ οὐδεπώποτε ἐπαύοντο πολλὰ κακὰ ἡμᾶς ποιοῦντες , νῦν ὁρῶ τούτους ἔχοντας ὥσπερ ἐγὼ ηὐχόμην .
For those who never ceased to do us no end of injury I now behold in just the condition that I desired.


3.2.16
1447
καὶ τοῦτο ἐπίστω , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ὅτι ἐγὼ ὥστε ἀπελάσαι Χαλδαίους ἀπὸ τούτων τῶν ἄκρων πολλαπλάσια ἂν ἔδωκα χρήματα ὧν σὺ νῦν ἔχεις παρ’ ἐμοῦ ·
And believe me, Cyrus, said he, when I say that to have driven the Chaldaeans from these heights I would have given many times as much money as you now have from me;


3.2.16
1448
καὶ ἃ ὑπισχνοῦ ποιήσειν ἀγαθὰ ἡμᾶς ὅτ’ ἐλάμβανες τὰ χρήματα , ἀποτετέλεσταί σοι ἤδη , ὥστε καὶ προσοφείλοντές σοι ἄλλας χάριτας ἀναπεφήναμεν , ἃς ἡμεῖς γε , εἰ μὴ κακοί ἐσμεν , αἰσχυνοίμεθ’ ἄν σοι μὴ ἀποδιδόντες .
and the benefit that you promised to do us, when you received the money, you have already conferred so fully that we obviously now owe you a new debt of gratitude besides; and we on our part, if we have not lost all self-respect, should be ashamed if we did not repay it to you.


3.2.17
1449
ὁ μὲν Ἀρμένιος τοσαῦτ’ ἔλεξεν .
Thus the Armenian king spoke.


3.2.17
1450
οἱ δὲ Χαλδαῖοι ἧκον δεόμενοι τοῦ Κύρου εἰρήνην σφίσι ποιῆσαι .
Now the Chaldaeans had come back with the request that Cyrus should make peace with them.


3.2.17
1451
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἐπήρετο αὐτούς ·
And Cyrus asked them:


3.2.17
1452
ἄλλο τι , ἔφη , ὦ Χαλδαῖοι , ἢ τούτου ἕνεκα εἰρήνης νῦν ἐπιθυμεῖτε ὅτι νομίζετε ἀσφαλέστερον ἂν δύνασθαι ζῆν εἰρήνης γενομένης ἢ πολεμοῦντες , ἐπεὶ ἡμεῖς τάδ’ ἔχομεν ;
Is this the reason that you, Chaldaeans, now desire peace, because you think, that since we are in possession of these heights, you could live in greater security if we had peace than if we were at war?


3.2.18
1453
ἔφασαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι .
The Chaldaeans assented.


3.2.18
1454
καὶ ὅς , τί δ’ , ἔφη , εἰ καὶ ἄλλα ὑμῖν ἀγαθὰ προσγένοιτο διὰ τὴν εἰρήνην ;
And what, said he, if still other blessings should accrue to you as a result of the proposed peace?


3.2.18
1455
ἔτι ἄν , ἔφασαν , μᾶλλον εὐφραινοίμεθα .
We should be still more pleased, they answered.


3.2.18
1456
ἄλλο τι οὖν , ἔφη , ἢ διὰ τὸ γῆς σπανίζειν ἀγαθῆς νῦν πένητες νομίζετ’ εἶναι ;
Well said he, do you think that you are now poor for any other reason than because you have so little fertile land?


3.2.18
1457
συνέφασαν καὶ τοῦτο .
In this also they agreed with him.


3.2.18
1458
τί οὖν ;
Well then, said Cyrus,


3.2.18
1459
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , βούλοισθ’ ἂν ἀποτελοῦντες ὅσαπερ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἀρμένιοι ἐξεῖναι ὑμῖν τῆς Ἀρμενίας γῆς ἐργάζεσθαι ὁπόσην ἂν θέλητε ;
would you avail yourselves of the permission to till as much Armenian land as you wish on condition that you paid in full just as much rental as other tenants in Armenia do? Yes said the Chaldaeans, if we could be sure of not being molested.


3.2.19
1460
ἔφασαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι , εἰ πιστεύοιμεν μὴ ἀδικήσεσθαι .
The Chaldaeans said they would, if they could be sure of not being molested.


3.2.19
1461
τί δέ , σύ , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , βούλοιο ἄν σοι τὴν νῦν ἀργὸν οὖσαν γῆν ἐνεργὸν γενέσθαι , εἰ μέλλοιεν τὰ νομιζόμενα παρὰ σοὶ ἀποτελεῖν οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι ;
Tell me, King of Armenia, said he, would you be willing that that land of yours which now lies uncultivated should be cultivated, if those who cultivate it would pay you the usual rental?


3.2.19
1462
ἔφη ὁ Ἀρμένιος πολλοῦ ἂν τοῦτο πρίασθαι ·
The Armenian answered that he would give a great deal to have it so;


3.2.19
1463
πολὺ γὰρ ἂν αὐξάνεσθαι τὴν πρόσοδον .
for in this way his revenues would be greatly increased.


3.2.20
1464
τί δ’ , ὑμεῖς , ἔφη , ὦ Χαλδαῖοι , ἐπεὶ ὄρη ἀγαθὰ ἔχετε , ἐθέλοιτ’ ἂν ἐᾶν νέμειν ταῦτα τοὺς Ἀρμενίους , εἰ ὑμῖν μέλλοιεν οἱ νέμοντες τὰ δίκαια ἀποτελεῖν ;
And tell me, Chaldaeans, said he, seeing that you have fine mountains, would you be willing to let the Armenians pasture their herds there, if the herdsmen would pay you what is fair?


3.2.20
1465
ἔφασαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ·
The Chaldaeans said they would;


3.2.20
1466
πολλὰ γὰρ ἂν ὠφελεῖσθαι οὐδὲν πονοῦντες .
for they would get large profits by it, without any labour on their own part.


3.2.20
1467
σὺ δέ , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , ἐθέλοις ἂν ταῖς τούτων νομαῖς χρῆσθαι , εἰ μέλλοις μικρὰ ὠφελῶν Χαλδαίους πολὺ πλείω ὠφελήσεσθαι ;
And you, King of Armenia, said he, would you be willing to rent their pasture lands, if by letting the Chaldaeans have a little profit you were to get much greater profit for yourself?


3.2.20
1468
καὶ σφόδρα ἄν , ἔφη , εἴπερ οἰοίμην ἀσφαλῶς νεμεῖν .
Why, of course, said he, if I thought I could pasture my cattle there in security.


3.2.20
1469
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , ἀσφαλῶς ἂν νέμοιτε , εἰ τὰ ἄκρα ἔχοιτε σύμμαχα ;
Well then, said he, could you pasture them there in security, if the heights were in the possession of your friends?


3.2.20
1470
ἔφη ὁ Ἀρμένιος .
Yes said the Armenian.


3.2.21
1471
ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφασαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι , οὐκ ἂν ἡμεῖς ἀσφαλῶς ἐργαζοίμεθα μὴ ὅτι τὴν τούτων , ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἂν τὴν ἡμετέραν , εἰ οὗτοι τὰ ἄκρα ἔχοιεν .
But, by Zeus, said the Chaldaeans, we could not even work our own farms in security, to say nothing of theirs, if they were to have possession of the heights.


3.2.21
1472
εἰ δ’ ὑμῖν αὖ , ἔφη , τὰ ἄκρα σύμμαχα εἶεν ;
But said Cyrus, suppose on the other hand that the heights were in the possession of your friends?


3.2.21
1473
οὕτως ἄν , ἔφασαν , ἡμῖν καλῶς ἔχοι .
In that case, they answered, we should be all right.


3.2.21
1474
ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Ἀρμένιος , οὐκ ἂν ἡμῖν αὖ καλῶς ἔχοι , εἰ οὗτοι παραλήψονται πάλιν τὰ ἄκρα ἄλλως τε καὶ τετειχισμένα .
But, by Zeus, said the Armenian, we, on our part, should not be all right, if they are again to get possession of the heights, especially now that they have been fortified.


3.2.22
1475
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
This then, said Cyrus,


3.2.22
1476
οὑτωσὶ τοίνυν , ἔφη , ἐγὼ ποιήσω ·
is what I shall do:


3.2.22
1477
οὐδετέροις ὑμῶν τὰ ἄκρα παραδώσω , ἀλλ’ ἡμεῖς φυλάξομεν αὐτά ·
I shall not give possession of the heights to either of you, but we shall keep a garrison there ourselves;


3.2.22
1478
κἂν ἀδικῶσιν ὑμῶν ὁπότεροι , σὺν τοῖς ἀδικουμένοις ἡμεῖς ἐσόμεθα .
and if either of you does wrong, we shall side with the injured party.


3.2.23
1479
ὡς δ’ ἤκουσαν ταῦτα ἀμφότεροι , ἐπῄνεσαν καὶ ἔλεγον ὅτι οὕτως ἂν μόνως ἡ εἰρήνη βεβαία γένοιτο .
And when they heard this proposal, both sides gave it their approval and said that only in this way could the peace be effective;


3.2.23
1480
καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις ἔδοσαν καὶ ἔλαβον πάντες τὰ πιστά , καὶ ἐλευθέρους μὲν ἀμφοτέρους ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων εἶναι συνετίθεντο , ἐπιγαμίας δ’ εἶναι καὶ ἐπεργασίας καὶ ἐπινομίας , καὶ ἐπιμαχίαν δὲ κοινήν , εἴ τις ἀδικοίη ὁποτέρους .
and upon these conditions they interchanged assurances of friendship, and agreed that each party should be independent of the other, that there should be the right of intermarriage and of mutual tillage and pasturage in each other’s territory, and that there should be a defensive alliance, in case any one should injure either party.


3.2.24
1481
οὕτω μὲν οὖν τότε διεπράχθη ·
Such, then, was the agreement entered into at that time;


3.2.24
1482
καὶ νῦν δὲ ἔτι οὕτω διαμένουσιν αἱ τότε γενόμεναι συνθῆκαι Χαλδαίοις καὶ τῷ τὴν Ἀρμενίαν ἔχοντι .
and to this day the covenants which were then made between the Chaldaeans and the king of Armenia still continue in force.


3.2.24
1483
ἐπεὶ δὲ αἱ συνθῆκαι ἐγεγένηντο , εὐθὺς συνετείχιζόν τε ἀμφότεροι προθύμως ὡς κοινὸν φρούριον καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια συνεισῆγον .
And when the treaty was made, they both together began with enthusiasm at once to build the fort for their common protection, and then together they stocked it with provisions.


3.2.25
1484
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἑσπέρα προσῄει , συνδείπνους ἔλαβεν ἀμφοτέρους πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ὡς φίλους ἤδη .
When evening was drawing on, he entertained both sides, now made friends, as his guests at dinner.


3.2.25
1485
συσκηνούντων δὲ εἶπέ τις τῶν Χαλδαίων ὅτι τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις σφῶν πᾶσιν εὐκτὰ ταῦτα εἴη ·
And while the party was in progress, one of the Chaldaeans said that to all the rest of them this state of affairs was desirable;


3.2.25
1486
εἰσὶ δέ τινες τῶν Χαλδαίων οἳ λῃζόμενοι ζῶσι καὶ οὔτ’ ἐπίστανται ἐργάζεσθαι οὔτ’ ἂν δύναιντο , εἰθισμένοι ἀπὸ πολέμου βιοτεύειν ·
but there were some of the Chaldaeans, so they said, who lived by plundering and would not know how to farm and could not, for they were used to making their living by the business of war;


3.2.25
1487
αἰδὲ γὰρ ἐλῄζοντο ἢ ἐμισθοφόρουν , πολλάκις μὲν παρὰ τῷ Ἰνδῶν βασιλεῖ ( καὶ γάρ , ἔφασαν , πολύχρυσος ἁνήρ ) , πολλάκις δὲ καὶ παρ’ Ἀστυάγει .
for they were always making raids or serving as mercenaries; they were often in the service of the Indian king (and he paid well, they said, for he was a very wealthy man) and often in the service of Astyages.


3.2.25
1488
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἔφη ·
And Cyrus said;


3.2.25
1489
τί οὖν οὐ καὶ νῦν παρ’ ἐμοὶ μισθοφοροῦσιν ;
Then why do they not enter my service now?


3.2.26
1490
ἐγὼ γὰρ δώσω ὅσον τις καὶ ἄλλος πλεῖστον δήποτε ἔδωκε .
I will pay as much as any one ever did.


3.2.26
1491
συνέφασαν οἱ , καὶ πολλούς γε ἔσεσθαι ἔλεγον τοὺς ἐθελήσοντας .
They assented and said that the volunteers would be many.


3.2.27
1492
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οὕτω συνωμολογεῖτο .
These terms were thus agreed upon;


3.2.27
1493
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὡς ἤκουσεν ὅτι πολλάκις πρὸς τὸν Ἰνδὸν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ἐπορεύοντο , ἀναμνησθεὶς ὅτι ἦλθον παρ’ αὐτοῦ κατασκεψόμενοι εἰς Μήδους τὰ αὐτῶν πράγματα καὶ ᾤχοντο πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους , ὅπως αὖ καὶ τὰ ἐκείνων κατίδωσιν , ἐβούλετο μαθεῖν τὸν Ἰνδὸν τὰ αὑτῷ πεπραγμένα .
and when Cyrus heard that the Chaldaeans made frequent trips to the Indian king, remembering that representatives from him had once come to Media to investigate conditions there and had then visited the enemy to inquire into theirs also, he wished to have him learn what he had done.


3.2.28
1494
ἤρξατο οὖν λόγου τοιοῦδε ·
Accordingly, he began to speak as follows:


3.2.28
1495
ὦ Ἀρμένιε , ἔφη , καὶ ὑμεῖς , ὦ Χαλδαῖοι , εἴπατέ μοι , εἴ τινα ἐγὼ νῦν τῶν ἐμῶν ἀποστέλλοιμι πρὸς τὸν Ἰνδόν , συμπέμψαιτ’ ἄν μοι τῶν ὑμετέρων οἵτινες αὐτῷ τήν τε ὁδὸν ἡγοῖντο ἂν καὶ συμπράττοιεν ὥστε γενέσθαι ἡμῖν παρὰ τοῦ Ἰνδοῦ ἃ ἐγὼ βούλομαι ;
King of Armenia, said he, and you Chaldaeans, tell me—if I should now send one of my men to the Indian king, would you send along some of yours to conduct him on the way and to co-operate with him in getting what I want from the king of India?


3.2.28
1496
ἐγὼ γὰρ χρήματα μὲν προσγενέσθαι ἔτι ἂν βουλοίμην ἡμῖν , ὅπως ἔχω καὶ μισθὸν ἀφθόνως διδόναι οἷς ἂν δέῃ καὶ τιμᾶν καὶ δωρεῖσθαι τῶν συστρατευομένων τοὺς ἀξίους ·
Now I should like to have more money, in order to be in a position both to pay generous wages when I ought, and to honour with rewards those of my fellow-soldiers who deserve it;


3.2.28
1497
τούτων δὴ ἕνεκα βούλομαι ὡς ἀφθονώτατα χρήματα ἔχειν , δεῖσθαι τούτων νομίζων .
and the reason why I wish to have as generous a supply of money as possible is that I expect to need it,


3.2.28
1498
τῶν δὲ ὑμετέρων ἡδύ μοι ἀπέχεσθαι φαίνεται ·
and I shall be glad to spare yours;


3.2.28
1499
φίλους γὰρ ὑμᾶς ἤδη νομίζω ·
for I now count you among my friends;


3.2.28
1500
παρὰ δὲ τοῦ Ἰνδοῦ ἡδέως ἂν λάβοιμι , εἰ διδοίη .
but from the Indian king I should be glad to accept a contribution, if he would offer it.


3.2.29
1501
ὁ οὖν ἄγγελος , ᾧ κελεύω ὑμᾶς ἡγεμόνας δοῦναι καὶ συμπράκτορας γενέσθαι , ἐλθὼν ἐκεῖσε ὧδε λέξει ·
Now, when the messenger, to whom I am asking you to furnish guides and co-workers, arrives there, he will speak on this wise:


3.2.29
1502
ἔπεμψέ με Κῦρος , ὦ Ἰνδέ , πρὸς σέ ·
King of India, Cyrus has sent me to you;


3.2.29
1503
φησὶ δὲ προσδεῖσθαι χρημάτων , προσδεχόμενος ἄλλην στρατιὰν οἴκοθεν ἐκ Περσῶν ·
he says that he needs more funds, for he is expecting another army from his home in Persia


3.2.29
1504
καὶ γὰρ προσδέχομαι , ἔφη ·
—and that is true, said he, for I am expecting one—


3.2.29
1505
ἢν οὖν αὐτῷ πέμψῃς ὁπόσα σοι προχωρεῖ , φησίν , ἢν θεὸς ἀγαθὸν τέλος διδῷ αὐτῷ , πειράσεσθαι ποιῆσαι ὥστε σε νομίζειν καλῶς βεβουλεῦσθαι χαρισάμενον αὐτῷ .
if, therefore, you will send him as much as you conveniently can, he says that if God will give him good success, he will try to make you think that you were well advised in doing him this favour.


3.2.30
1506
ταῦτα μὲν ὁ παρ’ ἐμοῦ λέξει .
This my envoy will say;


3.2.30
1507
τοῖς δὲ παρ’ ὑμῶν ὑμεῖς αὖ ἐπιστέλλετε ὅ τι ὑμῖν σύμφορον δοκεῖ εἶναι .
do you now, in your turn, give your representatives such instructions as you think expedient for you.


3.2.30
1508
καὶ ἢν μὲν λάβωμεν , ἔφη , παρ’ αὐτοῦ , ἀφθονωτέροις χρησόμεθα ·
And if we get anything from him, we shall have more abundant funds to use;


3.2.30
1509
ἢν δὲ μὴ λάβωμεν , εἰσόμεθα ὅτι οὐδεμίαν αὐτῷ χάριν ὀφείλομεν , ἀλλ’ ἐξέσται ἡμῖν ἐκείνου ἕνεκα πρὸς τὸ ἡμέτερον συμφέρον πάντα τίθεσθαι .
and if we do not, we shall know that we owe him no thanks, but may, as far as he is concerned, settle everything with a view to our own interests.


3.2.31
1510
ταῦτ’ εἶπεν ὁ Κῦρος , νομίζων τοὺς ἰόντας Ἀρμενίων καὶ Χαλδαίων τοιαῦτα λέξειν περὶ αὐτοῦ οἷα αὐτὸς ἐπεθύμει πάντας ἀνθρώπους καὶ λέγειν καὶ ἀκούειν περὶ αὐτοῦ .
Thus Cyrus spoke;


3.2.31
1511
καὶ τότε μὲν δή , ὁπότε καλῶς εἶχε , διαλύσαντες τὴν σκηνὴν ἀνεπαύοντο .
and he believed that those of the Armenians and Chaldaeans who were to go would say such things of him as he desired all men to say and to hear of him. And then, when it was time, the banquet came to an end, and they went to rest.


3.3.1
1512
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ὅ τε Κῦρος ἔπεμπε τὸν ἄγγελον ἐπιστείλας ὅσαπερ ἔφη καὶ ὁ Ἀρμένιος καὶ οἱ Χαλδαῖοι συνέπεμπον οὓς ἱκανωτάτους ἐνόμιζον εἶναι καὶ συμπρᾶξαι καὶ εἰπεῖν περὶ Κύρου τὰ προσήκοντα .
On the following day Cyrus gave the envoy the commission of which he had spoken and sent him on his way;


3.3.1
1513
ἐκ δὲ τούτου κατασκευάσας ὁ Κῦρος τὸ φρούριον καὶ φύλαξιν ἱκανοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἐπιτηδείοις πᾶσι καὶ ἄρχοντ’ αὐτῶν καταλιπὼν Μῆδον ὃν ᾤετο Κυαξάρῃ ἂν μάλιστα χαρίσασθαι , ἀπῄει συλλαβὼν τὸ στράτευμα ὅσον τε ἦλθεν ἔχων καὶ ὃ παρ’ Ἀρμενίων προσέλαβε , καὶ τοὺς παρὰ Χαλδαίων εἰς τετρακισχιλίους , οἳ ᾤοντο καὶ συμπάντων τῶν ἄλλων κρείττονες εἶναι .
and the Armenian king and the Chaldaeans sent along those who they thought would be most competent to co-operate and to say what was appropriate concerning Cyrus.


3.3.2
1514
ὡς δὲ κατέβη εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην , οὐδεὶς ἔμεινεν ἔνδον Ἀρμενίων οὔτ’ ἀνὴρ οὔτε γυνή , ἀλλὰ πάντες ὑπήντων ἡδόμενοι τῇ εἰρήνῃ καὶ φέροντες καὶ ἄγοντες ὅ τι ἕκαστος ἄξιον εἶχε .
Then he manned the fort with a competent garrison, supplied it with all things necessary, and left in command a Mede who he thought would be most acceptable to Cyaxares;


3.3.2
1515
καὶ ὁ Ἀρμένιος τούτοις οὐκ ἤχθετο , οὕτως ἂν νομίζων καὶ τὸν Κῦρον μᾶλλον ἥδεσθαι τῇ ὑπὸ πάντων τιμῇ .
and then he departed, taking with him not only the army which he had brought with him but also the reinforcements that he had received from the Armenians, and about four thousand Chaldaeans, who considered themselves actually better than all the rest put together.


3.3.2
1516
τέλος δὲ ὑπήντησε καὶ ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ Ἀρμενίου , τὰς θυγατέρας ἔχουσα καὶ τὸν νεώτερον υἱόν , καὶ σὺν ἄλλοις δώροις τὸ χρυσίον ἐκόμιζεν ὃ πρότερον οὐκ ἤθελε λαβεῖν Κῦρος .
And when he came down into the inhabited part of the country, not one of the Armenians remained indoors, but all, both men and women, in their joy at the restoration of peace, came forth to meet him, each one carrying or bringing whatever he had of value.


3.3.3
1517
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἰδὼν εἶπεν ·
And their king did not disapprove, for he thought that Cyrus would thus be all the better pleased at receiving honour from all.


3.3.3
1518
ὑμεῖς ἐμὲ οὐ ποιήσετε μισθοῦ περιόντα εὐεργετεῖν , ἀλλὰ σύ , ὦ γύναι , ἔχουσα ταῦτα τὰ χρήματα ἃ φέρεις ἄπιθι , καὶ τῷ μὲν Ἀρμενίῳ μηκέτι δῷς αὐτὰ κατορύξαι , ἔκπεμψον δὲ τὸν υἱὸν ὡς κάλλιστα ἀπ’ αὐτῶν κατασκευάσασα ἐπὶ τὴν στρατιάν ·
And finally also the queen with her daughters and her younger son came up to him bringing not only the money which before Cyrus had refused to take, but other gifts as well.


3.3.3
1519
ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν λοιπῶν κτῶ καὶ σαυτῇ καὶ τῷ ἀνδρὶ καὶ ταῖς θυγατράσι καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς ὅ τι κεκτημένοι καὶ κοσμήσεσθε κάλλιον καὶ ἥδιον τὸν αἰῶνα διάξετε ·
And when he saw it Cyrus said:


3.3.3
1520
εἰς δὲ τὴν γῆν , ἔφη , ἀρκείτω τὰ σώματα , ὅταν ἕκαστος τελευτήσῃ , κατακρύπτειν .
You shall not make me go about doing good for pay! No, good queen; take back home with you this money which you bring; and do not give it to the king again to bury, but with it get your son as fine an outfit as possible and send him to the army; and with what is left get both for yourself and your husband, your daughters and your sons, anything the possession of which will enable you to adorn yourselves more handsomely and spend your days more happily. But let it suffice, he added, to bury in the earth only our bodies, when the end shall come to each.


3.3.4
1521
ὁ μὲν ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν παρήλαυνεν ·
Thus he spoke and rode past her.


3.3.4
1522
ὁ δ’ Ἀρμένιος συμπρούπεμπε καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι πάντες ἄνθρωποι , ἀνακαλοῦντες τὸν εὐεργέτην , τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἀγαθόν ·
And the king of Armenia escorted him on his way, as did all the rest of the people, proclaiming him again and again their benefactor, their valiant hero.


3.3.4
1523
καὶ τοῦτ’ ἐποίουν , ἕως ἐκ τῆς χώρας ἐξέπεμψαν .
And this they continued to do until he had quitted their borders.


3.3.4
1524
συναπέστειλε δ’ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἀρμένιος καὶ στρατιὰν πλείονα , ὡς εἰρήνης οἴκοι οὔσης .
And as there was now peace at home, the king increased the contingent of troops that he sent with him.


3.3.5
1525
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κῦρος ἀπῄει κεχρηματισμένος οὐχ ἃ ἔλαβε μόνον χρήματα , ἀλλὰ πολὺ πλείονα τούτων ἡτοιμασμένος διὰ τὸν τρόπον , ὥστε λαμβάνειν ὁπότε δέοιτο .
Thus Cyrus departed, not only enriched with the ready money that he had received, but also having secured by his conduct far larger funds in reserve, to draw upon in time of need.


3.3.5
1526
καὶ τότε μὲν ἐστρατοπεδεύσατο ἐν τοῖς μεθορίοις .
That night he encamped upon the frontier,


3.3.5
1527
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ τὸ μὲν στράτευμα καὶ τὰ χρήματα ἔπεμψε πρὸς Κυαξάρην ·
and the next day he sent the army and the money to Cyaxares;


3.3.5
1528
ὁ δὲ πλησίον ἦν , ὥσπερ ἔφησεν ·
for he was near by, as he had promised to be.


3.3.5
1529
αὐτὸς δὲ σὺν Τιγράνῃ καὶ Περσῶν τοῖς ἀρίστοις ἐθήρα ὅπουπερ ἐπιτυγχάνοιεν θηρίοις καὶ ηὐφραίνετο .
But Cyrus himself went hunting with Tigranes and the best of his Persians, wherever they came across game, and he was delighted with the sport.


3.3.6
1530
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἀφίκετο εἰς Μήδους , τῶν χρημάτων ἔδωκε τοῖς αὑτοῦ ταξιάρχοις ὅσα ἐδόκει ἑκάστῳ ἱκανὰ εἶναι , ὅπως καὶ ἐκεῖνοι ἔχοιεν τιμᾶν , εἴ τινας ἄγαιντο τῶν ὑφ’ ἑαυτούς ·
Now when he came back to Media he gave to each of his captains as much of the money as he thought sufficient, so that they in turn might be able to reward any of the men under them with whose conduct they were pleased;


3.3.6
1531
ἐνόμιζε γάρ , εἰ ἕκαστος τὸ μέρος ἀξιέπαινον ποιήσειε , τὸ ὅλον αὐτῷ καλῶς ἔχειν .
for he thought that if each one made his division worthy of commendation, he would find the whole army in fine condition.


3.3.6
1532
καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ ὅ τι που καλὸν ἴδοι ἐς στρατιάν , ταῦτα κτώμενος διεδωρεῖτο τοῖς ἀεὶ ἀξιωτάτοις , νομίζων ὅ τι καλὸν κ- ἀγαθὸν ἔχοι τὸ στράτευμα , τούτοις ἅπασιν αὐτὸς κεκοσμῆσθαι .
And whenever he himself saw anywhere anything calculated to improve his army, he always procured it and distributed it in presents from time to time among the most deserving; for he thought that everything that his army had that was beautiful and fine was an adornment to himself.


3.3.7
1533
ἡνίκα δὲ αὐτοῖς διεδίδου ὧν ἔλαβεν , ἔλεξεν ὧδέ πως εἰς τὸ μέσον τῶν ταξιάρχων καὶ λοχαγῶν καὶ πάντων ὅσους ἐτίμα .
And when he was about to distribute a portion of what he had received, he took his place in the midst of the captains, lieutenants, and all whom he was about to reward, and spoke to this effect:


3.3.7
1534
ἄνδρες φίλοι , δοκεῖ ἡμῖν εὐφροσύνη τις νῦν παρεῖναι , καὶ ὅτι εὐπορία τις προσγεγένηται καὶ ὅτι ἔχομεν ἀφ’ ὧν τιμᾶν ἕξομεν οὓς ἂν βουλώμεθα καὶ τιμᾶσθαι ὡς ἂν ἕκαστος ἄξιος ᾖ .
My friends, there seems now to be a kind of gladness in our hearts, both because some degree of prosperity has come to us and because we have the means of rewarding those whom we will and of receiving rewards, each according to his deserts.


3.3.8
1535
πάντως δὴ ἀναμιμνῃσκώμεθα τὰ ποῖ’ ἄττα ἔργα τούτων τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἐστιν αἴτια ·
But let us be sure to remember to what kind of conduct these blessings are due;


3.3.8
1536
σκοπούμενοι γὰρ εὑρήσετε τό τε ἀγρυπνῆσαι ὅπου ἔδει καὶ τὸ πονῆσαι καὶ τὸ σπεῦσαι καὶ τὸ μὴ εἶξαι τοῖς πολεμίοις .
for if you will consider, you will find that it is this—watching when occasion demanded, undergoing toil, making due haste, and never yielding to the enemy.


3.3.8
1537
οὕτως οὖν χρὴ καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ἄνδρας ἀγαθοὺς εἶναι , γιγνώσκοντας ὅτι τὰς μεγάλας ἡδονὰς καὶ τ- ἀγαθὰ τὰ μεγάλα ἡ πειθὼ καὶ ἡ καρτερία καὶ οἱ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ πόνοι καὶ κίνδυνοι παρέχονται .
Accordingly, we must in future also be brave men, knowing that obedience, perseverance, and the endurance of toil and danger at the critical time bring the great pleasures and the great blessings.


3.3.9
1538
κατανοῶν δὲ ὁ Κῦρος ὡς εὖ μὲν αὐτῷ εἶχον τὰ σώματα οἱ στρατιῶται πρὸς τὸ δύνασθαι στρατιωτικοὺς πόνους φέρειν , εὖ δὲ τὰς ψυχὰς πρὸς τὸ καταφρονεῖν τῶν πολεμίων , ἐπιστήμονες δ’ ἦσαν τὰ προσήκοντα τῇ ἑαυτῶν ἕκαστοι ὁπλίσει , καὶ πρὸς τὸ πείθεσθαι δὲ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἑώρα πάντας εὖ παρεσκευασμένους , ἐκ τούτων οὖν ἐπεθύμει τι ἤδη τῶν πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους πράττειν , γιγνώσκων ὅτι ἐν τῷ μέλλειν πολλάκις τοῖς ἄρχουσι καὶ τῆς καλῆς παρασκευῆς ἀλλοιοῦταί τι .
Cyrus  now saw that his soldiers were in good physical condition to endure the fatigue of military service, that their hearts were disposed to regard the enemy with contempt, that they were skilled each in the exercise adapted to his kind of armour, and that they were all well disciplined to obey the officers; accordingly, he was eager to undertake some move against the enemy at once, for he knew that generals often find some even of their best laid plans brought to naught through delay.


3.3.10
1539
ἔτι δ’ ὁρῶν ὅτι φιλοτίμως ἔχοντες ἐν οἷς ἀντηγωνίζοντο πολλοὶ καὶ ἐπιφθόνως εἶχον πρὸς ἀλλήλους τῶν στρατιωτῶν , καὶ τούτων ἕνεκα ἐξάγειν αὐτοὺς ἐβούλετο εἰς τὴν πολεμίαν ὡς τάχιστα , εἰδὼς ὅτι οἱ κοινοὶ κίνδυνοι φιλοφρόνως ποιοῦσιν ἔχειν τοὺς συμμάχους πρὸς ἀλλήλους , καὶ οὐκέτι ἐν τούτῳ οὔτε τοῖς ἐν ὅπλοις κοσμουμένοις φθονοῦσιν οὔτε τοῖς δόξης ἐφιεμένοις , ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον καὶ ἐπαινοῦσι καὶ ἀσπάζονται οἱ τοιοῦτοι τοὺς ὁμοίους , νομίζοντες συνεργοὺς αὐτοὺς τοῦ κοινοῦ ἀγαθοῦ εἶναι .
And he further observed that, because they were so eager to excel in those exercises in which they vied with one another, many of the soldiers were even jealous of one another; for this reason also he wished to lead them into the enemy’s country as soon as possible. For he knew that common dangers make comrades kindly disposed toward one another, and that in the midst of such dangers there is no jealousy of those who wear decorations on their armour or of those who are striving for glory; on the contrary, soldiers praise and love their fellows even more, because they recognize in them co-workers for the common good.


3.3.11
1540
οὕτω δὴ πρῶτον μὲν ἐξώπλισε τὴν στρατιὰν καὶ κατέταξεν ὡς ἐδύνατο κάλλιστά τε καὶ ἄριστα , ἔπειτα δὲ συνεκάλεσε μυριάρχους καὶ χιλιάρχους καὶ ταξιάρχους καὶ λοχαγούς .
Accordingly, he first completely armed his forces and marshalled them in the best and most imposing order possible; then he called together the generals, colonels, captains, and lieutenants;


3.3.11
1541
οὗτοι γὰρ ἀπολελυμένοι ἦσαν τοῦ καταλέγεσθαι ἐν τοῖς τακτικοῖς ἀριθμοῖς , καὶ ὁπότε δέοι ἢ ὑπακούειν τῷ στρατηγῷ ἢ παραγγέλλειν τι , οὐδ’ ὣς οὐδὲν ἄναρχον κατελείπετο , ἀλλὰ δωδεκαδάρχοις καὶ ἑξαδάρχοις πάντα τὰ καταλειπόμενα διεκοσμεῖτο .
for these had been exempted from enrolment in the lines of the regular battalions; and even when it was necessary for any of them to report to the commander-in-chief or to transmit any order, no part of the army was left without a commanding officer, for the sergeants and corporals kept in proper order the divisions from which the superior officers had gone.


3.3.12
1542
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνῆλθον οἱ ἐπικαίριοι , παράγων αὐτοὺς ἐπεδείκνυέ τε αὐτοῖς τὰ καλῶς ἔχοντα καὶ ἐδίδασκεν ᾗ ἕκαστον ἰσχυρὸν ἦν τῶν συμμαχικῶν .
And when the staff-officers had come together, he conducted them along the ranks, showed them in what good order everything was and pointed out to them the special strength of each contingent of the auxiliaries.


3.3.12
1543
ἐπεὶ δὲ κ- ἐκείνους ἐποίησεν ἐρωτικῶς ἔχειν τοῦ ἤδη ποιεῖν τι , εἶπεν αὐτοῖς νῦν μὲν ἀπιέναι ἐπὶ τὰς τάξεις καὶ διδάσκειν ἕκαστον τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ ἅπερ αὐτὸς ἐκείνους , καὶ πειρᾶσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐπιθυμίαν ἐμβαλεῖν πᾶσι τοῦ στρατεύεσθαι , ὅπως εὐθυμότατα πάντες ἐξορμῷντο , πρῲ δὲ παρεῖναι ἐπὶ τὰς Κυαξάρου θύρας .
And when he had filled them with an eager desire for immediate action, he bade them then go to their own several divisions and tell their men what he had told them and try to inspire in them all a desire to begin the campaign, for he wished them all to start out in the best of spirits; and early in the morning they were to meet him at Cyaxares’s gates.


3.3.13
1544
τότε μὲν δὴ ἀπιόντες οὕτω πάντες ἐποίουν .
Thereupon they all went their way and proceeded so to do.


3.3.13
1545
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ παρῆσαν οἱ ἐπικαίριοι ἐπὶ θύραις .
At daybreak on the following day the staff-officers presented themselves at the gates of the king.


3.3.13
1546
σὺν τούτοις οὖν ὁ Κῦρος εἰσελθὼν πρὸς τὸν Κυαξάρην ἤρχετο λόγου τοιοῦδε .
So Cyrus went in with them to Cyaxares and began to speak as follows:


3.3.13
1547
οἶδα μέν , ἔφη , ὦ Κυαξάρη , ὅτι ἃ μέλλω λέγειν σοὶ πάλαι δοκεῖ οὐδὲν ἧττον ἢ ἡμῖν ·
I am sure, Cyaxares, said he, that you have this long time been thinking no less than we of the proposition that I am going to lay before you;


3.3.13
1548
ἀλλ’ ἴσως αἰσχύνῃ λέγειν ταῦτα , μὴ δοκῇς ἀχθόμενος ὅτι τρέφεις ἡμᾶς ἐξόδου μεμνῆσθαι .
but perhaps you hesitate to broach the subject for fear it should be thought that you speak of an expedition from here because you are embarrassed at having to maintain us.


3.3.14
1549
ἐπεὶ οὖν σὺ σιωπᾷς , ἐγὼ λέξω καὶ ὑπὲρ σοῦ καὶ ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν .
Therefore, since you do not say anything, I will speak both for you and for ourselves.


3.3.14
1550
ἡμῖν γὰρ δοκεῖ πᾶσιν , ἐπείπερ παρεσκευάσμεθα , μὴ ἐπειδὰν ἐμβάλωσιν οἱ πολέμιοι εἰς τὴν σὴν χώραν , τότε μάχεσθαι , μηδ’ ἐν τῇ φιλίᾳ καθημένους ἡμᾶς ὑπομένειν , ἀλλ’ ἰέναι ὡς τάχιστα εἰς τὴν πολεμίαν .
We are all agreed that, inasmuch as we are quite ready, it is best not to sit down here in a friendly country and wait till the enemy have invaded your territory before we begin to fight, but to go as quickly as possible into the enemy’s country.


3.3.15
1551
νῦν μὲν γὰρ ἐν τῇ σῇ χώρᾳ ὄντες πολλὰ τῶν σῶν σινόμεθα ἄκοντες ·
For now, while we are in your country, we do your people’s property much injury quite against our will;


3.3.15
1552
ἢν δ’ εἰς τὴν πολεμίαν ἴωμεν , τὰ ἐκείνων κακῶς ποιήσομεν ἡδόμενοι .
but if we go into the enemy’s country, we shall do injury to theirs with all our hearts.


3.3.16
1553
ἔπειτα νῦν μὲν σὺ ἡμᾶς τρέφεις πολλὰ δαπανῶν , ἢν δ’ ἐκστρατευσώμεθα , θρεψόμεθα ἐκ τῆς πολεμίας .
In the second place, you support us now at great expense; whereas, if we take the field, we shall get our support from the enemy’s country.


3.3.17
1554
ἔτι δὲ εἰ μὲν μείζων τις ἡμῖν ὁ κίνδυνος ἔμελλεν εἶναι ἐκεῖ ἢ ἐνθάδε , ἴσως τὸ ἀσφαλέστατον ἦν αἱρετέον .
And then again, if we were likely to be in any greater danger there than here, we should, perhaps, have to choose the safer course.


3.3.17
1555
νῦν δὲ ἴσοι μὲν ἐκεῖνοι ἔσονται , ἤν τε ἐνθάδε ὑπομένωμεν ἤν τε εἰς τὴν ἐκείνων ἰόντες ὑπαντῶμεν αὐτοῖς ·
But their numbers will be the same, whether we wait here or whether we go and meet them in their own territory.


3.3.17
1556
ἴσοι δὲ ἡμεῖς ὄντες μαχούμεθα , ἤν τε ἐνθάδε ἐπιόντας αὐτοὺς δεχώμεθα ἤν τε ἐπ’ ἐκείνους ἰόντες τὴν μάχην συνάπτωμεν .
And our numbers in the fight will be just the same, whether we engage them as they come hither or whether we go against them to join battle.


3.3.18
1557
πολὺ μέντοι ἡμεῖς βελτίοσι καὶ ἐρρωμενεστέραις ταῖς ψυχαῖς τῶν στρατιωτῶν χρησόμεθα , ἢν ἴωμεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ μὴ ἄκοντες ὁρᾶν δοκῶμεν τοὺς πολεμίους ·
We shall, however, find the courage of our soldiers much better and stronger, if we assume the offensive and show that we are not unwilling to face the foe;


3.3.18
1558
πολὺ δὲ κ- ἐκεῖνοι μᾶλλον ἡμᾶς φοβήσονται , ὅταν ἀκούσωσιν ὅτι οὐ φοβούμενοι πτήσσομεν αὐτοὺς οἴκοι καθήμενοι , ἀλλ’ ἐπεὶ αἰσθανόμεθα προσιόντας , ἀπαντῶμέν τε αὐτοῖς , ἵν’ ὡς τάχιστα συμμείξωμεν , καὶ οὐκ ἀναμένομεν ἕως ἂν ἡ ἡμετέρα χώρα κακῶται , ἀλλὰ φθάνοντες ἤδη δῃοῦμεν τὴν ἐκείνων γῆν .
and they will be much more afraid of us, when they hear that we do not sit down at home and cower in fear of them, but that, when we hear that they are coming, we advance to meet them to join battle as soon as possible, and do not wait until our country is ravaged, but take the initiative and devastate theirs.


3.3.19
1559
καίτοι , ἔφη , εἴ τι ἐκείνους μὲν φοβερωτέρους ποιήσομεν , ἡμᾶς δ’ αὐτοὺς θαρραλεωτέρους , πολὺ τοῦτο ἡμῖν ἐγὼ πλεονέκτημα νομίζω , καὶ τὸν κίνδυνον οὕτως ἡμῖν μὲν ἐλάττω λογίζομαι , τοῖς δὲ πολεμίοις μείζω .
And surely, he added, if we make them more afraid and ourselves more courageous, I think it would be a great gain to us and it would, as I reckon it, lessen the danger under such circumstances for us and increase it for the enemy.


3.3.19
1560
πολὺ γὰρ μᾶλλον , ὡς καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αἰεὶ λέγει καὶ σὺ φῄς , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι δὲ πάντες ὁμολογοῦσιν ὡς αἱ μάχαι κρίνονται μᾶλλον ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἢ ταῖς τῶν σωμάτων ῥώμαις .
And my father always says, and so do you, and all the rest agree, that battles are decided more by men’s souls than by the strength of their bodies.


3.3.20
1561
ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπε ·
Thus he spoke;


3.3.20
1562
Κυαξάρης δὲ ἀπεκρίνατο ·
and Cyaxares answered:


3.3.20
1563
ἀλλ’ ὅπως μέν , ὦ Κῦρε καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Πέρσαι , ἐγὼ ἄχθομαι ὑμᾶς τρέφων μηδ’ ὑπονοεῖτε ·
Do not let yourselves imagine, Cyrus and the rest of you Persians, that I am embarrassed at having to support you.


3.3.20
1564
τό γε μέντοι ἰέναι εἰς τὴν πολεμίαν ἤδη καὶ ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ βέλτιον εἶναι πρὸς πάντα .
As for invading the enemy’s country at once, however, I too consider that the better plan from every point of view.


3.3.20
1565
ἐπεὶ τοίνυν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὁμογνωμονοῦμεν , συσκευαζώμεθα καὶ ἢν τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἡμῖν θᾶττον συγκαταινῇ , ἐξίωμεν ὡς τάχιστα .
Well then, said Cyrus, since we are agreed, let us make ready and, as soon as ever the gods give us their sanction, let us march out without a moment’s delay.


3.3.21
1566
ἐκ τούτου τοῖς μὲν στρατιώταις εἶπον συσκευάζεσθαι ·
Hereupon they gave the soldiers the word to make ready to break camp.


3.3.21
1567
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἔθυε πρῶτον μὲν Διὶ βασιλεῖ , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις θεοῖς , οὓς ἡγεῖτο ἵλεως καὶ εὐμενεῖς ὄντας ἡγεμόνας ἂν γενέσθαι τῇ στρατιᾷ καὶ παραστάτας ἀγαθοὺς καὶ συμμάχους καὶ συμβούλους τῶν ἀγαθῶν .
And Cyrus proceeded to sacrifice first to Sovereign Zeus and then to the rest of the gods; and he besought them to lead his army with their grace and favour and to be their mighty defenders and helpers and counsellors for the common good.


3.3.21
1568
συμπαρεκάλει δὲ καὶ ἥρωας γῆς Μηδίας οἰκήτορας καὶ κηδεμόνας .
And he called also upon the heroes who dwelt in Media and were its guardians.


3.3.22
1569
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐκαλλιέρησέ τε καὶ ἁθρόον ἦν αὐτῷ τὸ στράτευμα πρὸς τοῖς ὁρίοις , τότε δὴ οἰωνοῖς χρησάμενος αἰσίοις ἐνέβαλεν εἰς τὴν πολεμίαν .
And when the sacrifice was found to be favourable and his army was assembled at the frontier, then amid favourable auspices he crossed into the enemy’s country.


3.3.22
1570
ἐπεὶ δὲ τάχιστα διέβη τὰ ὅρια , ἐκεῖ αὖ καὶ Γῆν ἱλάσκετο χοαῖς καὶ θεοὺς θυσίαις καὶ ἥρωας Ἀσσυρίας οἰκήτορας ηὐμενίζετο .
And as soon as he had crossed the boundary, there again he made propitiatory offerings to Earth with libations and sought with sacrifices to win the favour of the gods and heroes that dwelt in Assyria.


3.3.22
1571
ταῦτα δὲ ποιήσας αὖθις Διὶ πατρῴῳ ἔθυε , καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος θεῶν ἀνεφαίνετο , οὐδενὸς ἠμέλει .
And when he had done this he sacrificed again to Zeus, the god of his fathers; and of the other divinities that were brought to his attention he neglected not one.


3.3.23
1572
ἐπεὶ δὲ καλῶς ταῦτα εἶχεν , εὐθὺς τοὺς μὲν πεζοὺς προαγαγόντες οὐ πολλὴν ὁδὸν ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο , τοῖς δ’ ἵπποις καταδρομὴν ποιησάμενοι περιεβάλοντο πολλὴν καὶ παντοίαν λείαν .
And when these rites were duly performed, they at once led the infantry forward a short distance and pitched camp, while with the cavalry they made a raid and got possession of a large quantity of every sort of booty.


3.3.23
1573
καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν δὲ μεταστρατοπεδευόμενοι καὶ ἔχοντες ἄφθονα τὰ ἐπιτήδεια καὶ δῃοῦντες τὴν χώραν ἀνέμενον τοὺς πολεμίους .
And thenceforward they shifted their camp from time to time, kept provisions supplied in abundance, and ravaged the country, while they awaited the enemy’s approach.


3.3.24
1574
ἡνίκα δὲ προσιόντες ἐλέγοντο οὐκέτι δέχ’ ἡμερῶν ὁδὸν ἀπέχειν , τότε δὴ ὁ Κῦρος λέγει ·
And when rumours came that the enemy were advancing and no longer ten days’ march away, then Cyrus said:


3.3.24
1575
ὦ Κυαξάρη , ὥρα δὴ ἀπαντᾶν καὶ μήτε τοῖς πολεμίοις δοκεῖν μήτε τοῖς ἡμετέροις φοβουμένους μὴ ἀντιπροσιέναι , ἀλλὰ δῆλοι ὦμεν ὅτι οὐκ ἄκοντες μαχούμεθα .
Now, Cyaxares, is the time for us to go to meet them and not to let either the enemy or our own men suppose that we fail to advance against them out of fear, but let us make it clear that we are not going to fight against our will.


3.3.25
1576
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα συνέδοξε τῷ Κυαξάρῃ , οὕτω δὴ συντεταγμένοι προῇσαν τοσοῦτον καθ’ ἡμέραν ὅσον ἐδόκει αὐτοῖς καλῶς ἔχειν .
As Cyaxares agreed to this, they advanced in battle order each day as far as they thought proper.


3.3.25
1577
καὶ δεῖπνον μὲν αἰεὶ κατὰ φῶς ἐποιοῦντο , πυρὰ δὲ νύκτωρ οὐκ ἔκαιον ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ ·
Their dinner they always prepared by daylight, and at night they never lighted a fire in camp.


3.3.25
1578
ἔμπροσθεν μέντοι τοῦ στρατοπέδου ἔκαιον , ὅπως ὁρῷεν μὲν εἴ τινες νυκτὸς προσίοιεν διὰ τὸ πῦρ , μὴ ὁρῷντο δ’ ὑπὸ τῶν προσιόντων .
They did, however, keep fires burning in front of the camp, in order that if anyone approached in the dark, they might see him by the light of the fire but not be seen.


3.3.25
1579
πολλάκις δὲ καὶ ὄπισθεν τοῦ στρατοπέδου ἐπυρπόλουν ἀπάτης ἕνεκα τῶν πολεμίων .
And frequently also they kept fires burning in the rear of the camp for the purpose of deceiving the enemy;


3.3.25
1580
ὥστ’ ἔστιν ὅτε καὶ κατάσκοποι ἐνέπιπτον εἰς τὰς προφυλακὰς αὐτῶν , διὰ τὸ ὄπισθεν τὰ πυρὰ εἶναι ἔτι πρόσω τοῦ στρατοπέδου οἰόμενοι εἶναι .
and so sometimes the enemy’s scouts fell into the hands of the pickets; for because the fires were behind, they supposed themselves to be still far in front of the camp.


3.3.26
1581
οἱ μὲν οὖν Ἀσσύριοι καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτοῖς , ἐπεὶ ἤδη ἐγγὺς ἀλλήλων τὰ στρατεύματα ἐγίγνοντο , τάφρον περιεβάλοντο , ὅπερ καὶ νῦν ἔτι ποιοῦσιν οἱ βάρβαροι βασιλεῖς , ὅπου ἂν στρατοπεδεύωνται , τάφρον περιβάλλονται εὐπετῶς διὰ τὴν πολυχειρίαν ·
Then, when the two armies were near each other, the Assyrians and their allies drew a ditch around their camp, as even to this day the barbarian kings do whenever they go into camp; and they throw up such entrenchments with ease because of the multitude of hands at their command.


3.3.26
1582
ἴσασι γὰρ ὅτι ἱππικὸν στράτευμα ἐν νυκτὶ ταραχῶδές ἐστι καὶ δύσχρηστον ἄλλως τε καὶ βάρβαρον .
They take this precaution because they know that cavalry troops — especially barbarian cavalry — are at night prone to confusion and hard to manage.


3.3.27
1583
πεποδισμένους γὰρ ἔχουσι τοὺς ἵππους ἐπὶ ταῖς φάτναις , καὶ εἴ τις ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἴοι , ἔργον μὲν νυκτὸς λῦσαι ἵππους , ἔργον δὲ χαλινῶσαι , ἔργον δ’ ἐπισάξαι , ἔργον δὲ θωρακίσασθαι , ἀναβάντας δ’ ἐφ’ ἵππων ἐλάσαι διὰ στρατοπέδου παντάπασιν ἀδύνατον .
For they keep their horses hobbled at the mangers, and if any enemy should make an attack, it is a difficult task to loose the horses in the darkness, it is difficult to bridle them, difficult to saddle them, difficult to put on a coat of mail, and utterly impossible to mount and ride through camp.


3.3.27
1584
τούτων δὴ ἕνεκα πάντων καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι καὶ ἐκεῖνοι τὰ ἐρύματα περιβάλλονται , καὶ ἅμα αὐτοῖς δοκεῖ τὸ ἐν ἐχυρῷ εἶναι ἐξουσίαν παρέχειν ὅταν βούλωνται μάχεσθαι .
For all these reasons and also because they think that if they are behind fortifications they are in a position to choose their time for fighting, the Assyrians and the rest of the barbarians throw up breastworks.


3.3.28
1585
τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ ποιοῦντες ἐγγὺς ἀλλήλων ἐγίγνοντο .
With such tactics the armies were approaching each other;


3.3.28
1586
ἐπεὶ δὲ προσιόντες ἀπεῖχον ὅσον παρασάγγην , οἱ μὲν Ἀσσύριοι οὕτως ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο ὥσπερ εἴρηται , ἐν περιτεταφρευμένῳ μὲν καταφανεῖ δέ , ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὡς ἐδύνατο ἐν ἀφανεστάτῳ , κώμας τε καὶ γηλόφους ἐπίπροσθεν ποιησάμενος , νομίζων πάντα τὰ πολέμια ἐξαίφνης ὁρώμενα φοβερώτερα τοῖς ἐναντίοις εἶναι .
but when, as they advanced, they were only about a parasang apart, the Assyrians encamped in the manner described in a place surrounded, indeed, by a ditch, but open to view. Cyrus, on the other hand, encamped in a place as much out of sight as possible, keeping under cover behind the hills and villages, for he thought that if all one’s equipment for war flashes suddenly into view, it inspires more terror in the enemy.


3.3.28
1587
καὶ ἐκείνην μὲν τὴν νύκτα ὥσπερ ἔπρεπε προφυλακὰς ποιησάμενοι ἑκάτεροι ἐκοιμήθησαν .
And that night each side stationed advance guards, as was proper, and went to rest.


3.3.29
1588
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ὁ μὲν Ἀσσύριος καὶ ὁ Κροῖσος καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ἡγεμόνες ἀνέπαυον τὰ στρατεύματα ἐν τῷ ἐχυρῷ ·
And on the following day the Assyrian king and Croesus and the other commanders let their troops rest within the entrenchments;


3.3.29
1589
Κῦρος δὲ καὶ Κυαξάρης συνταξάμενοι περιέμενον , ὡς εἰ προσίοιεν οἱ πολέμιοι , μαχούμενοι .
but Cyrus and Cyaxares awaited them in battle array, ready to fight if the enemy should come on.


3.3.29
1590
ὡς δὲ δῆλον ἐγένετο ὅτι οὐκ ἐξίοιεν οἱ πολέμιοι ἐκ τοῦ ἐρύματος οὐδὲ μάχην ποιήσοιντο ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρα , ὁ μὲν Κυαξάρης καλέσας τὸν Κῦρον καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τοὺς ἐπικαιρίους ἔλεξε τοιάδε ·
But when it was evident that the enemy would not come out from behind their breastworks nor accept battle that day, Cyaxares called Cyrus and the staff officers besides and spoke as follows:


3.3.30
1591
δοκεῖ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ ἄνδρες , ὥσπερ τυγχάνομεν συντεταγμένοι οὕτως ἰέναι πρὸς τὸ ἔρυμα τῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ δηλοῦν ὅτι θέλομεν μάχεσθαι .
Men said he, I propose to march up to those fellows’ breastworks, drawn up just as we are now, and show them that we are eager to fight.


3.3.30
1592
οὕτω γάρ , ἔφη , ἐὰν μὴ ἀντεπεξίωσιν ἐκεῖνοι , οἱ μὲν ἡμέτεροι μᾶλλον θαρρήσαντες ἀπίασιν , οἱ πολέμιοι δὲ τὴν τόλμαν ἰδόντες ἡμῶν μᾶλλον φοβήσονται .
For, said he, if we do that and they do not come out against us, our men will come back to camp more full of courage, and the enemy seeing our daring will be more frightened.


3.3.30
1593
τούτῳ μὲν οὕτως ἐδόκει .
Such was his proposal.


3.3.31
1594
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος , μηδαμῶς , ἔφη , πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , ὦ Κυαξάρη , οὕτω ποιήσωμεν .
But Cyrus said: No, by the gods, Cyaxares, let us not do that; never!


3.3.31
1595
εἰ γὰρ ἤδη ἐκφανέντες πορευσόμεθα , ὡς σὺ κελεύεις , νῦν τε προσιόντας ἡμᾶς οἱ πολέμιοι θεάσονται οὐδὲν φοβούμενοι , εἰδότες ὅτι ἐν ἀσφαλεῖ εἰσι τοῦ μηδὲν παθεῖν , ἐπειδάν τε μηδὲν ποιήσαντες ἀπίωμεν , πάλιν καθορῶντες ἡμῶν τὸ πλῆθος πολὺ ἐνδεέστερον τοῦ ἑαυτῶν καταφρονήσουσι , καὶ αὔριον ἐξίασι πολὺ ἐρρωμενεστέραις ταῖς γνώμαις .
For if we march out and show ourselves, as you suggest, the enemy will see us marching up but will have no fear, for they know that they are secure against any injury; and when we withdraw without having accomplished anything, they will furthermore see that our numbers are inferior to their own and despise us; and tomorrow they will come out with much stouter hearts.


3.3.32
1596
νῦν δ’ , ἔφη , εἰδότες μὲν ὅτι πάρεσμεν , οὐχ ὁρῶντες δὲ ἡμᾶς , εὖ τοῦτο ἐπίστω , οὐ καταφρονοῦσιν , ἀλλὰ φροντίζουσι τί ποτε τοῦτ’ ἔστι , καὶ διαλεγόμενοι περὶ ἡμῶν ἐγώ- οἶδ’ ὅτι οὐδὲν παύονται .
But as matters stand now, said he, as they know that we are here but do not see us, you may be sure that they do not despise us but inquire anxiously what in the world this means, and I am positive that they are talking about us all the time.


3.3.32
1597
ὅταν δ’ ἐξίωσι , τότε δεῖ αὐτοῖς ἅμα φανερούς τε ἡμᾶς γενέσθαι καὶ ἰέναι εὐθὺς ὁμόσε , εἰληφότας αὐτοὺς ἔνθα πάλαι ἐβουλόμεθα .
But when they come out, then we must show ourselves and at once engage them hand to hand, when we shall have them where we have long since been wishing to have them.


3.3.33
1598
λέξαντος δ’ οὕτω Κύρου συνέδοξε ταῦτα καὶ Κυαξάρῃ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις .
When Cyrus had thus spoken, Cyaxares and the rest agreed with him.


3.3.33
1599
καὶ τότε μὲν δειπνοποιησάμενοι καὶ φυλακὰς καταστησάμενοι καὶ πυρὰ πολλὰ πρὸ τῶν φυλακῶν καύσαντες ἐκοιμήθησαν .
And then, when they had dined and stationed their sentinels and lighted many fires in front of the outposts, they went to rest.


3.3.34
1600
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ πρῲ Κῦρος μὲν ἐστεφανωμένος ἔθυε , παρήγγειλε δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ὁμοτίμοις ἐστεφανωμένοις πρὸς τὰ ἱερὰ παρεῖναι .
Early on the following day Cyrus crowned himself with a garland and prepared to sacrifice, and sent word to the rest of the peers to attend the service with chaplets on their heads.


3.3.34
1601
ἐπεὶ δὲ τέλος εἶχεν ἡ θυσία , συγκαλέσας αὐτοὺς ἔλεξεν ·
And when the sacrifice was concluded, Cyrus called them together and said:


3.3.34
1602
ἄνδρες , οἱ μὲν θεοί , ὡς οἵ τε μάντεις φασὶ καὶ ἐμοὶ συνδοκεῖ , μάχην τ’ ἔσεσθαι προαγγέλλουσι καὶ νίκην διδόασι καὶ σωτηρίαν ὑπισχνοῦνται ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς .
Men, the gods announce, as the soothsayers say and also as I interpret it, that there is to be a battle; through the omens of the sacrifice they grant us victory and promise us no loss.


3.3.35
1603
ἐγὼ δὲ ὑμῖν μὲν παραινῶν ποίους τινὰς χρὴ εἶναι ἐν τῷ τοιῷδε κἂν αἰσχυνοίμην ἄν ·
Now I should be ashamed indeed to suggest to you how you ought to conduct yourselves at such a time;


3.3.35
1604
οἶδα γὰρ ὑμᾶς ταῦτα ἐπισταμένους καὶ μεμελετηκότας καὶ ἀσκοῦντας διὰ τέλους οἷάπερ ἐγώ , ὥστε κἂν ἄλλους εἰκότως ἂν διδάσκοιτε .
for I know that you understand what you have to do, that you have practised it, and have been continually hearing of it just as I have, so that you might properly even teach others.


3.3.35
1605
τάδε δὲ εἰ μὴ τυγχάνετε κατανενοηκότες , ἀκούσατε ·
But if you happen not to have had this other matter called to your attention, listen.


3.3.36
1606
οὓς γὰρ νεωστὶ συμμάχους τε ἔχομεν καὶ πειρώμεθα ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ὁμοίους ποιεῖν , τούτους δὲ ἡμᾶς δεῖ ὑπομιμνῄσκειν ἐφ’ οἷς τε ἐτρεφόμεθα ὑπὸ Κυαξάρου , ἅ τε ἠσκοῦμεν , ἐφ’ ἅ τε αὐτοὺς παρακεκλήκαμεν , ὧν τε ἄσμενοι ἀνταγωνισταὶ ἔφασαν ἡμῖν ἔσεσθαι .
Those whom we recently took as our comrades and whom we are trying to make like ourselves — these men we must remind of the conditions on which we have been maintained by Cyaxares, what we have been in training for, why we have invited them to join us, and what it is in which they said they would gladly be our rivals.


3.3.37
1607
καὶ τοῦτο δ’ αὐτοὺς ὑπομιμνῄσκετε ὅτι ἥδε ἡ ἡμέρα δείξει ὧν ἕκαστός ἐστιν ἄξιος .
And remind them also that this day will prove what each one is worth.


3.3.37
1608
ὧν γὰρ ἂν ὀψιμαθεῖς ἄνθρωποι γένωνται , οὐδὲν θαυμαστὸν εἴ τινες αὐτῶν καὶ τοῦ ὑπομιμνῄσκοντος δέοιντο , ἀλλ’ ἀγαπητὸν εἰ καὶ ἐξ ὑποβολῆς δύναιντο ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ εἶναι .
For when people are late in learning anything, it is not surprising that some of them actually need a monitor; and we may be content if they manage even with the help of a suggestion to prove themselves valiant.


3.3.38
1609
καὶ ταῦτα μέντοι πράττοντες ἅμα καὶ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν πεῖραν λήψεσθε .
And in doing this, you will at the same time be getting a proof of yourselves also.


3.3.38
1610
ὁ μὲν γὰρ δυνάμενος ἐν τῷ τοιῷδε καὶ ἄλλους βελτίους ποιεῖν εἰκότως ἂν ἤδη καὶ ἑαυτῷ συνειδείη τελέως ἀγαθὸς ἀνὴρ ὤν , ὁ δὲ τὴν τούτων ὑπόμνησιν αὐτὸς μόνος ἔχων καὶ τοῦτ’ ἀγαπῶν , εἰκότως ἂν ἡμιτελῆ αὑτὸν νομίζοι .
For he who on such an occasion can make others more valiant would naturally also gain the consciousness that he is himself a thoroughly valiant man;


3.3.39
1611
τούτου δ’ ἕνεκα οὐκ ἐγώ , ἔφη , αὐτοῖς λέγω , ἀλλ’ ὑμᾶς κελεύω λέγειν , ἵνα καὶ ἀρέσκειν ὑμῖν πειρῶνται ·
he, on the other hand, who keeps all to himself the admonition to such conduct and rests satisfied with that might properly consider himself but half valiant.


3.3.39
1612
ὑμεῖς γὰρ καὶ πλησιάζετε αὐτοῖς ἕκαστος τῷ ἑαυτοῦ μέρει .
The reason why I do not speak to them but bid you do so is that so they may try to please you,


3.3.39
1613
εὖ δ’ ἐπίστασθε ὡς ἢν θαρροῦντας τούτοις ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς ἐπιδεικνύητε , καὶ τούτους καὶ ἄλλους πολλοὺς οὐ λόγῳ ἀλλ’ ἔργῳ θαρρεῖν διδάξετε .
for you are in touch with them, each in his own division.


3.3.40
1614
τέλος εἶπεν ἀπιόντας ἀριστᾶν ἐστεφανωμένους καὶ σπονδὰς ποιησαμένους ἥκειν εἰς τὰς τάξεις αὐτοῖς στεφάνοις .
And remember this, that if in their eyes you prove yourselves courageous, you will teach not only your comrades but many others also, not by precept merely but by example, to be courageous.


3.3.40
1615
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἀπῆλθον , αὖθις τοὺς οὐραγοὺς προσεκάλεσε , καὶ τούτοις τοιάδε ἐνετέλλετο .
In concluding, he told them to go with their chaplets on and take luncheon and when they had poured the libation to go, still wearing the chaplets, to their posts.


3.3.41
1616
ἄνδρες Πέρσαι , ὑμεῖς καὶ τῶν ὁμοτίμων γεγόνατε καὶ ἐπιλελεγμένοι ἐστέ , οἳ δοκεῖτε τὰ μὲν ἄλλα τοῖς κρατίστοις ὅμοιοι εἶναι , τῇ δ’ ἡλικίᾳ καὶ φρονιμώτεροι .
And when they had gone away, he called in the officers of the rear-guard and gave them the following instructions:


3.3.41
1617
καὶ τοίνυν χώραν ἔχετε οὐδὲν ἧττον ἔντιμον τῶν πρωτοστατῶν ·
Men of Persia, you also have now taken your places among the peers, and you have been selected for your positions because you are considered in every way equal to the bravest, and by virtue of your years even more discreet than they.


3.3.41
1618
ὑμεῖς γὰρ ὄπισθεν ὄντες τούς τ’ ἀγαθοὺς ἂν ἐφορῶντες καὶ ἐπικελεύοντες αὐτοῖς ἔτι κρείττους ποιοῖτε , καὶ εἴ τις μαλακίζοιτο , καὶ τοῦτον ὁρῶντες οὐκ ἂν ἐπιτρέποιτε αὐτῷ .
And so you occupy a place not at all less honourable than that of our front-rank men.


3.3.42
1619
συμφέρει δ’ ὑμῖν , εἴπερ τῳ καὶ ἄλλῳ , τὸ νικᾶν καὶ διὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν καὶ διὰ τὸ βάρος τῆς στολῆς .
For as you are behind, you can observe those who are valiant and by exhorting them make them still more valiant; and if any one should be inclined to hang back and you should see it, you would not permit it.


3.3.42
1620
ἢν δ’ ἄρα ὑμᾶς καὶ οἱ ἔμπροσθεν ἀνακαλοῦντες ἕπεσθαι παρεγγυῶσιν , ὑπακούετε αὐτοῖς , καὶ ὅπως μηδ’ ἐν τούτῳ αὐτῶν ἡττηθήσεσθε , ἀντιπαρακελευόμενοι αὐτοῖς θᾶττον ἡγεῖσθαι ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους .
And because of your years and because of the weight of your armour it is more to your advantage than to any others’ that we should be victorious.


3.3.42
1621
καὶ ἀπιόντες , ἔφη , ἀριστήσαντες καὶ ὑμεῖς ἥκετε σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐστεφανωμένοι ἐς τὰς τάξεις .
And if those in front call to you and bid you follow, obey them and see that you be not outdone by them even in this respect but give them a counter cheer to lead on faster against the enemy.


3.3.43
1622
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἀμφὶ Κῦρον ἐν τούτοις ἦσαν ·
Now go and get your luncheon and then go with your chaplets on your heads with the others to your posts.


3.3.43
1623
οἱ δὲ Ἀσσύριοι καὶ δὴ ἠριστηκότες ἐξῇσάν τε θρασέως καὶ παρετάττοντο ἐρρωμένως .
Thus Cyrus and his men were occupied;


3.3.43
1624
παρέταττε δὲ αὐτοὺς αὐτὸς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐφ’ ἅρματος παρελαύνων καὶ τοιάδε παρεκελεύετο .
and the Assyrians, when they had lunched, came out boldly and bravely drew up in line.


3.3.44
1625
ἄνδρες Ἀσσύριοι , νῦν δεῖ ἄνδρας ἀγαθοὺς εἶναι ·
And the king in person rode along in his chariot and marshalled the lines and exhorted them as follows:


3.3.44
1626
νῦν γὰρ ὑπὲρ ψυχῶν τῶν ὑμετέρων ἁγὼν καὶ ὑπὲρ γῆς ἐν ᾗ ἔφυτε καὶ περὶ οἴκων ἐν οἷς ἐτράφητε , καὶ ὑπὲρ γυναικῶν τε καὶ τέκνων καὶ περὶ πάντων ὧν πέπασθε ἀγαθῶν .
Men of Assyria, now is the time for you to be brave men;


3.3.44
1627
νικήσαντες μὲν γὰρ ἁπάντων τούτων ὑμεῖς ὥσπερ πρόσθεν κύριοι ἔσεσθε ·
for the struggle now impending is one for your lives, for the land in which you were born, for the homes in which you were bred, for your wives and children and all the blessings you enjoy.


3.3.44
1628
εἰ δ’ ἡττηθήσεσθε , εὖ ἴστε ὅτι παραδώσετε ταῦτα πάντα τοῖς πολεμίοις .
For if you are victorious, you will have possession of all that, as before; but if you are defeated, be well assured that you will surrender it all to the enemy.


3.3.45
1629
ἅτε οὖν νίκης ἐρῶντες μένοντες μάχεσθε .
Therefore, as you desire victory, stand and fight;


3.3.45
1630
μῶρον γὰρ τὸ κρατεῖν βουλομένους τὰ τυφλὰ τοῦ σώματος καὶ ἄοπλα καὶ ἄχειρα ταῦτα ἐναντία τάττειν τοῖς πολεμίοις φεύγοντας ·
for it would be folly for men who desire to win a battle to turn their backs and offer to the enemy the side of their body that is without eyes or hands or weapons;


3.3.45
1631
μῶρος δὲ καὶ εἴ τις ζῆν βουλόμενος φεύγειν ἐπιχειροίη , εἰδὼς ὅτι οἱ μὲν νικῶντες σῴζονται , οἱ δὲ φεύγοντες ἀποθνῄσκουσι μᾶλλον τῶν μενόντων ·
and any one who wishes to live would be a fool if he tried to run away, when he knows that it is the victors who save their lives, while those who try to run away are more likely to meet their death than those who stand their ground.


3.3.45
1632
μῶρος δὲ καὶ εἴ τις χρημάτων ἐπιθυμῶν ἧτταν προσίεται .
And if any one desires wealth, he also is foolish if he submits to defeat.


3.3.45
1633
τίς γὰρ οὐκ οἶδεν ὅτι οἱ μὲν νικῶντες τά τε ἑαυτῶν σῴζουσι καὶ τὰ τῶν ἡττωμένων προσλαμβάνουσιν , οἱ δὲ ἡττώμενοι ἅμα ἑαυτούς τε καὶ τὰ ἑαυτῶν πάντα ἀποβάλλουσιν ;
For who does not know that the victors not only save what is their own but take in addition the property of the vanquished, while the vanquished throw both themselves and all they have away?


3.3.45
1634
ὁ μὲν δὴ Ἀσσύριος ἐν τούτοις ἦν .
Thus the Assyrian was occupied;


3.3.46
1635
ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης πέμπων πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἤδη καιρὸς εἴη ἄγειν ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους ·
and Cyaxares sent to Cyrus to say that now was the time to advance upon the enemy.


3.3.46
1636
εἰ γὰρ νῦν , ἔφη , ἔτι ὀλίγοι εἰσὶν οἱ ἔξω τοῦ ἐρύματος , ἐν ᾧ ἂν προσίωμεν πολλοὶ ἔσονται ·
For said he, although those outside the fortifications are as yet but few, they will become many while we are advancing;


3.3.46
1637
μὴ οὖν ἀναμείνωμεν ἕως ἂν πλείους ἡμῶν γένωνται .
let us therefore not wait until their numbers are more than our own,


3.3.46
1638
ἀλλ’ ἴωμεν ἕως ἔτι οἰόμεθα εὐπετῶς ἂν αὐτῶν κρατῆσαι .
but let us go while yet we think we could defeat them easily.


3.3.47
1639
ὁ δ’ αὖ Κῦρος ἀπεκρίνατο ·
But, Cyaxares, answered Cyrus,


3.3.47
1640
ὦ Κυαξάρη , εἰ μὴ ὑπὲρ ἥμισυ αὐτῶν ἔσονται οἱ ἡττηθέντες , εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι ἡμᾶς μὲν ἐροῦσι φοβουμένους τὸ πλῆθος τοῖς ὀλίγοις ἐπιχειρῆσαι , αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐ νομιοῦσιν ἡττῆσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἄλλης σοι μάχης δεήσει , ἐν ᾗ ἄμεινον ἂν ἴσως βουλεύσαιντο ἢ νῦν βεβούλευνται , παραδόντες ἑαυτοὺς ἡμῖν ταμιεύεσθαι ὥσθ’ ὁπόσοις ἂν βουλώμεθα αὐτῶν μάχεσθαι .
if it is not more than half of them that are defeated, you may rest assured that they will say that we attacked only a few because we were afraid of their main body, and they will maintain that they have not been defeated; the result will be that you will find another battle necessary; and then they may perhaps plan better than they have now in delivering themselves so completely to our disposal that we may fight as many or as few of them as we please.


3.3.48
1641
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἄγγελοι ταῦτ’ ἀκούσαντες ᾤχοντο .
The messengers received this answer and were gone.


3.3.48
1642
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἧκε Χρυσάντας ὁ Πέρσης καὶ ἄλλοι τινὲς τῶν ὁμοτίμων αὐτομόλους ἄγοντες .
And at this juncture Chrysantas, the Persian, and certain other peers came up with some deserters.


3.3.48
1643
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ὥσπερ εἰκὸς ἠρώτα τοὺς αὐτομόλους τὰ ἐκ τῶν πολεμίων .
And Cyrus, as a matter of course, asked the deserters what was going on among the enemy;


3.3.48
1644
οἱ δ’ ἔλεγον ὅτι ἐξίοιέν τε ἤδη σὺν τοῖς ὅπλοις καὶ παρατάττοι αὐτοὺς αὐτὸς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔξω ὢν καὶ παρακελεύοιτο μὲν δὴ τοῖς αἰεὶ ἔξω οὖσι πολλά τε καὶ ἰσχυρά , ὡς ἔφασαν λέγειν τοὺς ἀκούοντας .
and they said that the troops were already coming out under arms and that the king was out in person marshalling them and addressing them with many earnest words of exhortation as they came out in succession. So, they said, those reported who heard him.


3.3.49
1645
ἔνθα δὴ ὁ Χρυσάντας εἶπε ·
How would it do, Cyrus, Chrysantas then asked,


3.3.49
1646
τί δ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , εἰ καὶ σὺ συγκαλέσας ἕως ἔτι ἔξεστι παρακελεύσαιο , εἰ ἄρα τι καὶ σὺ ἀμείνους ποιήσαις τοὺς στρατιώτας ;
for you to get your men together, too, while yet you may, and exhort them, and see if you also might make your soldiers better men.


3.3.50
1647
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Do not let the exhortations of the Assyrian trouble you in the least, Chrysantas, answered Cyrus;


3.3.50
1648
ὦ Χρυσάντα , μηδέν σε λυπούντων αἱ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου παρακελεύσεις ·
for no speech of admonition can be so fine that it will all at once make those who hear it good men if they are not good already;


3.3.50
1649
οὐδεμία γάρ ἐστιν οὕτω καλὴ παραίνεσις ἥτις τοὺς μὴ ὄντας ἀγαθοὺς αὐθημερὸν ἀκούσαντας ἀγαθοὺς ποιήσει ·
it would surely not make archers good if they had not had previous practice in shooting; neither could it make lancers good, nor horsemen; it cannot even make men able to endure bodily labour, unless they have been trained to it before.


3.3.50
1650
οὐκ ἂν οὖν τοξότας γε , εἰ μὴ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦτο μεμελετηκότες εἶεν , οὐδὲ μὴν ἀκοντιστάς , οὐδὲ μὴν ἱππέας , ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ μὴν τά γε σώματα ἱκανοὺς πονεῖν , ἢν μὴ πρόσθεν ἠσκηκότες ὦσι .
But, Cyrus, answered Chrysantas, it is really enough if you make their souls better with your words of exhortation.


3.3.51
1651
καὶ ὁ Χρυσάντας εἶπεν ·
Do you really think, returned Cyrus,


3.3.51
1652
ἀλλ’ ἀρκεῖ τοι , ὦ Κῦρε , ἢν τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν ἀμείνονας παρακελευσάμενος ποιήσῃς .
that one word spoken could all at once fill with a sense of honour the souls of those who hear, or keep them from actions that would be wrong, and convince them that for the sake of praise they must undergo every toil and every danger?


3.3.51
1653
ἦ καὶ δύναιτ’ ἄν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , εἷς λόγος ῥηθεὶς αὐθημερὸν αἰδοῦς μὲν ἐμπλῆσαι τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν ἀκουόντων , ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν αἰσχρῶν κωλῦσαι , προτρέψαι δὲ ὡς χρὴ ἐπαίνου μὲν ἕνεκα πάντα μὲν πόνον , πάντα δὲ κίνδυνον ὑποδύεσθαι , λαβεῖν δ’ ἐν ταῖς γνώμαις βεβαίως τοῦτο ὡς αἱρετώτερόν ἐστι μαχομένους ἀποθνῄσκειν μᾶλλον ἢ φεύγοντας σῴζεσθαι ;
Could it impress the idea indelibly upon their minds that it is better to die in battle than to save one’s life by running away?


3.3.52
1654
ἆρ’ οὐκ , ἔφη , εἰ μέλλουσι τοιαῦται διάνοιαι ἐγγραφήσεσθαι ἀνθρώποις καὶ ἔμμονοι ἔσεσθαι , πρῶτον μὲν νόμους ὑπάρξαι δεῖ τοιούτους δι’ ὧν τοῖς μὲν ἀγαθοῖς ἔντιμος καὶ ἐλευθέριος ὁ βίος παρασκευασθήσεται , τοῖς δὲ κακοῖς ταπεινός τε καὶ ἀλγεινὸς καὶ ἀβίωτος ὁ αἰὼν ἐπανακείσεται ;
And,  he continued,  if such sentiments are to be imprinted on men’s hearts and to be abiding, is it not necessary in the first place that laws be already in existence such that by them a life of freedom and honour shall be provided for the good, but that upon the bad shall be imposed a life of humiliation and misery which would not be worth living?


3.3.53
1655
ἔπειτα διδασκάλους οἶμαι δεῖ καὶ ἄρχοντας ἐπὶ τούτοις γενέσθαι οἵ τινες δείξουσί τε ὀρθῶς καὶ διδάξουσι καὶ ἐθιοῦσι ταῦτα δρᾶν , ἔστ’ ἂν ἐγγένηται αὐτοῖς τοὺς μὲν ἀγαθοὺς καὶ εὐκλεεῖς εὐδαιμονεστάτους τῷ ὄντι νομίζειν , τοὺς δὲ κακοὺς καὶ δυσκλεεῖς ἀθλιωτάτους ἁπάντων ἡγεῖσθαι .
And then again, I think, there must be, in addition to the laws, teachers and officers to show them the right way, to teach them and accustom them to do as they are taught, until it becomes a part of their nature to consider the good and honourable men as really the most happy, and to look upon the bad and the disreputable as the most wretched of all people.


3.3.53
1656
οὕτω γὰρ δεῖ διατεθῆναι τοὺς μέλλοντας τοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων φόβου τὴν μάθησιν κρείττονα παρέξεσθαι .
For such ought to be the feelings of those who are going to show the victory of training over fear in the presence of the enemy.


3.3.54
1657
εἰ δέ τοι ἰόντων εἰς μάχην σὺν ὅπλοις , ἐν ᾧ πολλοὶ καὶ τῶν παλαιῶν μαθημάτων ἐξίστανται , ἐν τούτῳ δυνήσεταί τις ἀπορραψῳδήσας παραχρῆμα ἄνδρας πολεμικοὺς ποιῆσαι , πάντων ἂν ῥᾷστον εἴη καὶ μαθεῖν καὶ διδάξαι τὴν μεγίστην τῶν ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἀρετήν .
But if, when soldiers are about to go armed into battle, when many forget even the lessons oft learned of old, if then any one by an oratorical flourish can then and there make men warlike, it would be the easiest thing under heaven both to learn and to teach the greatest virtue in the world.


3.3.55
1658
ἐπεὶ ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη , οὐδ’ ἂν τούτοις ἐπίστευον ἐμμόνοις ἔσεσθαι οὓς νῦν ἔχοντες παρ’ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ἠσκοῦμεν , εἰ μὴ καὶ ὑμᾶς ἑώρων παρόντας , οἳ καὶ παράδειγμα αὐτοῖς ἔσεσθε οἵους χρὴ εἶναι καὶ ὑποβαλεῖν δυνήσεσθε , ἤν τι ἐπιλανθάνωνται .
For even in the case of those whom we have kept and trained among ourselves, I, for my part, should not trust even them to be steadfast, if I did not see you also before me, who will be an example to them of what they ought to be and who will be able to prompt them if they forget anything.


3.3.55
1659
τοὺς δ’ ἀπαιδεύτους παντάπασιν ἀρετῆς θαυμάζοιμ’ ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ Χρυσάντα , εἴ τι πλέον ἂν ὠφελήσειε λόγος καλῶς ῥηθεὶς εἰς ἀνδραγαθίαν ἢ τοὺς ἀπαιδεύτους μουσικῆς ᾆσμα καλῶς ᾀσθὲν εἰς μουσικήν .
But I should be surprised, Chrysantas, if a word well spoken would help those wholly untrained in excellence to the attainment of manly worth any more than a song well sung would help those untrained in music to high attainments in music.


3.3.56
1660
οἱ μὲν ταῦτα διελέγοντο .
Thus they conversed.


3.3.56
1661
ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης πάλιν πέμπων ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἐξαμαρτάνοι διατρίβων καὶ οὐκ ἄγων ὡς τάχιστα ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους .
And again Cyaxares sent to Cyrus to say that he was making a serious mistake to delay instead of leading as soon as possible against the enemy.


3.3.56
1662
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἀπεκρίνατο δὴ τότε τοῖς ἀγγέλοις ·
And then Cyrus answered the messengers saying:


3.3.56
1663
ἀλλ’ εὖ μὲν ἴστω , ἔφη , ὅτι οὔπω εἰσὶν ἔξω ὅσους δεῖ ·
Very well; but I want him to know that there are not yet as many of them outside the breastworks as we ought to have;


3.3.56
1664
καὶ ταῦτα ἀπαγγέλλετε αὐτῷ ἐν ἅπασιν ·
and tell him this in the presence of all.


3.3.56
1665
ὅμως δέ , ἐπεὶ ἐκείνῳ δοκεῖ , ἄξω ἤδη .
Nevertheless, since he thinks best, I will lead on at once.


3.3.57
1666
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν καὶ προσευξάμενος τοῖς θεοῖς ἐξῆγε τὸ στράτευμα .
When he had said this, he prayed to the gods and led out his army.


3.3.57
1667
ὡς δ’ ἤρξατο ἄγειν , ἤδη θᾶττον ἡγεῖτο , οἱ δ’ εἵποντο εὐτάκτως μὲν διὰ τὸ ἐπίστασθαί τε καὶ μεμελετηκέναι ἐν τάξει πορεύεσθαι , ἐρρωμένως δὲ διὰ τὸ φιλονίκως ἔχειν πρὸς ἀλλήλους καὶ διὰ τὸ τὰ σώματα ἐκπεπονῆσθαι καὶ διὰ τὸ πάντας ἄρχοντας τοὺς πρωτοστάτας εἶναι , ἡδέως δὲ διὰ τὸ φρονίμως ἔχειν ·
And as soon as he began to advance, he led on at a double-quick pace and they followed in good order, for they understood marching in line and had practised it; moreover, they followed courageously, because they were in eager rivalry with one another and because their bodies were in thorough training and because the front-rank men were all officers; and they followed gladly, because they were intelligent men;


3.3.57
1668
ἠπίσταντο γὰρ καὶ ἐκ πολλοῦ οὕτως ἐμεμαθήκεσαν ἀσφαλέστατον εἶναι καὶ ῥᾷστον τὸ ὁμόσε ἰέναι τοῖς πολεμίοις , ἄλλως τε καὶ τοξόταις καὶ ἀκοντισταῖς καὶ ἱππεῦσιν .
for they had become convinced by long instruction that the easiest and safest way was to meet the enemy hand to hand — especially if that enemy were made up of bowmen, spearmen, and cavalry.


3.3.58
1669
ἕως δ’ ἔτι ἔξω βελῶν ἦσαν , παρηγγύα ὁ Κῦρος σύνθημα Ζεὺς σύμμαχος καὶ ἡγεμών .
While they were still out of range, Cyrus passed the watchword, Zeus our Helper and our Guide.


3.3.58
1670
ἐπεὶ δὲ πάλιν ἧκε τὸ σύνθημα ἀνταποδιδόμενον , ἐξῆρχεν αὐτὸς ὁ Κῦρος παιᾶνα τὸν νομιζόμενον ·
And when the watchword came back and was delivered again to him, Cyrus himself began the usual paean,


3.3.58
1671
οἱ δὲ θεοσεβῶς πάντες συνεπήχησαν μεγάλῃ τῇ φωνῇ ·
and they all devoutly joined with a loud voice in the singing,


3.3.58
1672
ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ γὰρ δὴ οἱ δεισιδαίμονες ἧττον τοὺς ἀνθρώπους φοβοῦνται .
for in the performance of such service the God-fearing have less fear of men.


3.3.59
1673
ἐπεὶ δ’ ὁ παιὰν ἐγένετο , ἅμα πορευόμενοι οἱ ὁμότιμοι φαιδροὶ πεπαιδευμένοι καὶ παρορῶντες εἰς ἀλλήλους , ὀνομάζοντες παραστάτας , ἐπιστάτας , λέγοντες πολὺ τὸ ἄγετ’ ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἄγετ’ ἄνδρες ἀγαθοί , παρεκάλουν ἀλλήλους ἕπεσθαι .
And when the paean was ended, the peers marched on cheerily, well-disciplined, looking toward one another, calling by name to comrades beside them and behind them, and often saying: On, friends, On, brave fellows; thus they encouraged one another to the charge.


3.3.59
1674
οἱ δ’ ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν ἀκούσαντες ἀντιπαρεκελεύοντο τοῖς πρώτοις ἡγεῖσθαι ἐρρωμένως .
And those behind, hearing them, in their turn cheered the front line to lead them bravely on.


3.3.59
1675
ἦν δὲ μεστὸν τὸ στράτευμα τῷ Κύρῳ προθυμίας , φιλοτιμίας , ῥώμης , θάρρους , παρακελευσμοῦ , σωφροσύνης , πειθοῦς , ὅπερ οἶμαι δεινότατον τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις .
So Cyrus’s army was filled with enthusiasm, ambition, strength, courage, exhortation, self-control, obedience; and this, I think, is the most formidable thing an enemy has to face.


3.3.60
1676
τῶν δ’ Ἀσσυρίων οἱ μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν ἁρμάτων προμαχοῦντες , ὡς ἐγγὺς ἤδη προσεμίγνυε τὸ Περσικὸν πλῆθος , ἀνέβαινόν τε ἐπὶ τὰ ἅρματα καὶ ὑπεξῆγον πρὸς τὸ ἑαυτῶν πλῆθος ·
But when the main body of the Persians began to get close to them, those of the Assyrians who dismounted from their chariots and fought in front of their army remounted their chariots and gradually drew back to their own main body,


3.3.60
1677
οἱ δὲ τοξόται καὶ ἀκοντισταὶ καὶ σφενδονῆται αὐτῶν ἀφίεσαν τὰ βέλη πολὺ πρὶν ἐξικνεῖσθαι .
while the bowmen, spearmen, and slingers let fly their missiles long before they could reach the enemy.


3.3.61
1678
ὡς δ’ ἐπιόντες οἱ Πέρσαι ἐπέβησαν τῶν ἀφειμένων βελῶν , ἐφθέγξατο δὴ ὁ Κῦρος ·
And when the Persians, charging on, set foot upon the missiles that had been discharged, Cyrus shouted,


3.3.61
1679
ἄνδρες ἄριστοι , ἤδη θᾶττόν τις ἰὼν ἐπιδεικνύτω ἑαυτὸν καὶ παρεγγυάτω .
Bravest of men, now let each press on and distinguish himself and pass the word to the others to come on faster.


3.3.61
1680
οἱ μὲν δὴ παρεδίδοσαν ·
And they passed it on;


3.3.61
1681
ὑπὸ δὲ προθυμίας καὶ μένους καὶ τοῦ σπεύδειν συμμεῖξαι δρόμου τινὲς ἦρξαν , συνεφείπετο δὲ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ φάλαγξ δρόμῳ .
and under the impulse of their enthusiasm, courage, and eagerness to close with the enemy some broke into a run, and the whole phalanx also followed at a run.


3.3.62
1682
καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Κῦρος ἐπιλαθόμενος τοῦ βάδην δρόμῳ ἡγεῖτο , καὶ ἅμα ἐφθέγγετο τίς ἕψεται ;
And even Cyrus himself, forgetting to proceed at a walk, led them on at a run and shouted as he ran: Who will follow?


3.3.62
1683
τίς ἀγαθός ;
Who is brave?


3.3.62
1684
τίς ἄνδρα πρῶτος καταβαλεῖ ;
Who will be the first to lay low his man?


3.3.62
1685
οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες τ- αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἐφθέγγοντο , καὶ διὰ πάντων δὲ ὥσπερ παρηγγύα οὕτως ἐχώρει τίς ἕψεται ;
And those who heard him shouted with the same words, and the cry passed through all the ranks as he had started it: Who will follow?


3.3.63
1686
τίς ἀγαθός ;
Who is brave?


3.3.63
1687
οἱ μὲν δὴ Πέρσαι οὕτως ἔχοντες ὁμόσε ἐφέροντο .
In such spirit the Persians rushed to the encounter,


3.3.63
1688
οἵ γε μὴν πολέμιοι οὐκέτι ἐδύναντο μένειν , ἀλλὰ στραφέντες ἔφευγον εἰς τὸ ἔρυμα .
and the enemy could no longer stand their ground but turned and fled back into their entrenchments.


3.3.64
1689
οἱ δ’ αὖ Πέρσαι κατά τε τὰς εἰσόδους ἐφεπόμενοι ὠθουμένων αὐτῶν πολλοὺς κατεστρώννυσαν , τοὺς δ’ εἰς τὰς τάφρους ἐμπίπτοντας ἐπεισπηδῶντες ἐφόνευον ἄνδρας ὁμοῦ καὶ ἵππους ·
And the Persians on their part, following them up to the gates, mowed many of them down as they were pushing and shoving one another; and upon some who fell into the ditches they leaped down and slew them, both men and horses;


3.3.64
1690
ἔνια γὰρ τῶν ἁρμάτων εἰς τὰς τάφρους ἠναγκάσθη φεύγοντα ἐμπεσεῖν .
for some of the chariots were forced in their flight to plunge into the ditches.


3.3.65
1691
καὶ οἱ τῶν Μήδων δ’ ἱππεῖς ὁρῶντες ταῦτα ἤλαυνον εἰς τοὺς ἱππέας τοὺς τῶν πολεμίων ·
And when the Median cavalry saw this, they also charged upon the enemy’s cavalry;


3.3.65
1692
οἱ δ’ ἐνέκλιναν καὶ αὐτοί .
but the latter gave way, like the rest.


3.3.65
1693
ἔνθα δὴ καὶ ἵππων διωγμὸς ἦν καὶ ἀνδρῶν , καὶ φόνος δὲ ἀμφοτέρων .
Then followed a pursuit of horses and men and slaughter of both.


3.3.66
1694
οἱ δ’ ἐντὸς τοῦ ἐρύματος τῶν Ἀσσυρίων ἑστηκότες ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς τῆς τάφρου τοξεύειν μὲν ἢ ἀκοντίζειν εἰς τοὺς κατακαίνοντας οὔτε ἐφρόνουν οὔτε ἐδύναντο διὰ τὰ δεινὰ ὁράματα καὶ διὰ τὸν φόβον .
And those of the Assyrians inside the fort who stood upon the rampart of the breastworks neither had the presence of mind to shoot arrows or hurl spears at the enemy who were mowing down their ranks, nor had they the strength to do so because of the awful spectacle and their own panic fear.


3.3.66
1695
τάχα δὲ καὶ καταμαθόντες τῶν Περσῶν τινας διακεκοφότας πρὸς τὰς εἰσόδους τοῦ ἐρύματος ἐτράποντο καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κεφαλῶν τῶν ἔνδον .
And presently, discovering that some of the Persians had cut their way through to the gates in the embankment, they turned away even from the inner rampart of the breastworks.


3.3.67
1696
ἰδοῦσαι δ’ αἱ γυναῖκες τῶν Ἀσσυρίων καὶ τῶν συμμάχων ἤδη φυγὴν καὶ ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ ἀνέκραγον καὶ ἔθεον ἐκπεπληγμέναι , αἱ μὲν καὶ τέκνα ἔχουσαι , αἱ δὲ καὶ νεώτεραι , καταρρηγνύμεναί τε πέπλους καὶ δρυπτόμεναι , καὶ ἱκετεύουσαι πάντας ὅτῳ ἐντυγχάνοιεν μὴ φεύγειν καταλιπόντας αὐτάς , ἀλλ’ ἀμῦναι καὶ αὐταῖς καὶ τέκνοις καὶ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς .
And the women of the Assyrians and their allies, seeing the men in flight even inside the camp, raised a cry and ran panic-stricken, both those who had children and the younger women as well, while they rent their garments, tore their cheeks, and begged all whom they met not to run away and leave them but to defend both them and their children and themselves as well.


3.3.68
1697
ἔνθα δὴ καὶ αὐτοὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς σὺν τοῖς πιστοτάτοις στάντες ἐπὶ τὰς εἰσόδους καὶ ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐμάχοντο καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις παρεκελεύοντο .
Then even the kings themselves with their most trusty followers took their stand at the gates, mounted upon the ramparts, and both fought in person and encouraged the rest to fight.


3.3.69
1698
ὡς δ’ ἔγνω ὁ Κῦρος τὰ γιγνόμενα , δείσας μὴ καὶ εἰ βιάσαιντο εἴσω , ὀλίγοι ὄντες ὑπὸ πολλῶν σφαλεῖέν τι , παρηγγύησεν ἐπὶ πόδ’ ἀνάγειν ἔξω βελῶν καὶ πείθεσθαι .
But when Cyrus  realized what was going on, he feared lest his men, even if they did force their way in, might be worsted by superior numbers, for his own men were but few; so he gave orders to retreat still facing the foe, until they were out of range.


3.3.70
1699
ἔνθα δὴ ἔγνω τις ἂν τοὺς ὁμοτίμους πεπαιδευμένους ὡς δεῖ ·
Then one might have seen the ideal discipline of the peers;


3.3.70
1700
ταχὺ μὲν γὰρ αὐτοὶ ἐπείθοντο , ταχὺ δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις παρήγγελλον .
for they themselves obeyed at once and at once passed on the word to the rest.


3.3.70
1701
ὡς δ’ ἔξω βελῶν ἐγένοντο , ἔστησαν κατὰ χώραν , πολὺ μᾶλλον χοροῦ ἀκριβῶς εἰδότες ὅπου ἔδει ἕκαστον αὐτῶν γενέσθαι .
And when they were out of range, they halted in their regular positions, for they knew much more accurately than a chorus, each the spot where he should stand.




4.1.1
1702
μείνας δὲ ὁ Κῦρος μέτριον χρόνον αὐτοῦ σὺν τῷ στρατεύματι καὶ δηλώσας ὅτι ἕτοιμοί εἰσι μάχεσθαι εἴ τις ἐξέρχοιτο , ὡς οὐδεὶς ἀντεξῄει , ἀπήγαγεν ὅσον ἐδόκει καλῶς ἔχειν καὶ ἐστρατοπεδεύσατο .
Cyrus remained there for a while with his army and showed that they were ready to do battle, if any one should come out. But as no one did come out against him, he withdrew as far as he thought proper and encamped.


4.1.1
1703
φυλακὰς δὲ καταστησάμενος καὶ σκοποὺς προπέμψας , στὰς εἰς τὸ μέσον συνεκάλεσε τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ στρατιώτας καὶ ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
And when he had stationed his outposts and sent out his scouts, he called together his own men, took his place in their midst, and addressed them as follows:


4.1.2
1704
ἄνδρες Πέρσαι , πρῶτον μὲν τοὺς θεοὺς ἐγὼ ἐπαινῶ ὅσον δύναμαι , καὶ ὑμεῖς δὲ πάντες , οἶμαι ·
Fellow-citizens of Persia, first of all I praise the gods with all my soul; and so, I believe, do all of you;


4.1.2
1705
νίκης τε γὰρ τετυχήκαμεν καὶ σωτηρίας .
for we not only have won a victory, but our lives have been spared.


4.1.2
1706
τούτων μὲν οὖν χρὴ χαριστήρια ὧν ἂν ἔχωμεν τοῖς θεοῖς ἀποτελεῖν .
We ought, therefore, to render to the gods thank-offerings of whatsoever we have.


4.1.2
1707
ἐγὼ δὲ σύμπαντας μὲν ὑμᾶς ἤδη ἐπαινῶ ·
And I here and now commend you as a body,


4.1.2
1708
τὸ γὰρ γεγενημένον ἔργον σύμπασιν ὑμῖν καλῶς ἀποτετέλεσται ·
for you have all contributed to this glorious achievement;


4.1.2
1709
ὧν δ’ ἕκαστος ἄξιος , ἐπειδὰν παρ’ ὧν προσήκει πύθωμαι , τότε τὴν ἀξίαν ἑκάστῳ καὶ λόγῳ καὶ ἔργῳ πειράσομαι ἀποδιδόναι .
but as for the deserts of each of you individually, I shall try by word and deed to give every man his due reward, when I have ascertained from proper sources what credit each one deserves.


4.1.3
1710
τὸν δ’ ἐμοῦ ἐγγύτατα ταξίαρχον Χρυσάνταν οὐδὲν ἄλλων δέομαι πυνθάνεσθαι , ἀλλ’ αὐτὸς οἶδα οἷος ἦν ·
But as to Captain Chrysantas, who fought next to me, I have no need to make enquiry from others, for I myself know how gallant his conduct was;


4.1.3
1711
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλα ὅσαπερ οἶμαι καὶ πάντες ὑμεῖς ἐποιεῖτε ·
in everything else he did just as I think all of you also did;


4.1.3
1712
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐγὼ παρηγγύησα ἐπανάγειν καλέσας αὐτὸν ὀνομαστί , ἀνατεταμένος οὗτος τὴν μάχαιραν ὡς παίσων πολέμιον ὑπήκουσέ τε ἐμοὶ εὐθὺς ἀφείς τε ὃ ἔμελλε ποιεῖν τὸ κελευόμενον ἔπραττεν ·
but when I gave the word to retreat and called to him by name, even though he had his sword raised to smite down an enemy he obeyed me at once and refrained from what he was on the point of doing and proceeded to carry out my order;


4.1.3
1713
αὐτός τε γὰρ ἐπανῆγε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις μάλα ἐπισπερχῶς παρηγγύα ·
not only did he himself retreat but he also with instant promptness passed the word on to the others;


4.1.3
1714
ὥστ’ ἔφθασεν ἔξω βελῶν τὴν τάξιν ποιήσας πρὶν τοὺς πολεμίους κατανοῆσαι ὅτι ἀνεχωροῦμεν καὶ τόξα ἐντείνασθαι καὶ τὰ παλτὰ ἐπαφεῖναι ·
and so he succeeded in getting his division out of range before the enemy discovered that we were retreating or drew their bows or let fly their javelins.


4.1.3
1715
ὥστε αὐτός τε ἀβλαβὴς καὶ τοὺς αὑτοῦ ἄνδρας ἀβλαβεῖς διὰ τὸ πείθεσθαι παρέχεται .
And thus by his obedience he is unharmed himself and he has kept his men unharmed.


4.1.4
1716
ἄλλους δ’ , ἔφη , ὁρῶ τετρωμένους , περὶ ὧν ἐγὼ σκεψάμενος ἐν ὁποίῳ χρόνῳ ἐτρώθησαν , τότε τὴν γνώμην περὶ αὐτῶν ἀποφανοῦμαι .
But others, said he, I see wounded; and when I have enquired at what moment of the engagement they received their wounds, I will then express my opinion concerning them.


4.1.4
1717
Χρυσάνταν δὲ ὡς καὶ ἐργάτην τῶν ἐν πολέμῳ καὶ φρόνιμον καὶ ἄρχεσθαι ἱκανὸν καὶ ἄρχειν χιλιαρχίᾳ μὲν ἤδη τιμῶ ·
But Chrysantas, as a mighty man of war, prudent and fitted to command and to obey — him I now promote to a colonelship.


4.1.4
1718
ὅταν δὲ καὶ ἄλλο τι ἀγαθὸν ὁ θεὸς δῷ , οὐδὲ τότε ἐπιλήσομαι αὐτοῦ .
And when God shall vouchsafe some further blessing, then, too, I shall not forget him.


4.1.5
1719
καὶ πάντας δὲ βούλομαι ὑμᾶς , ἔφη , ὑπομνῆσαι ·
I wish also to leave this thought with all of you, he went on:


4.1.5
1720
ἃ γὰρ νῦν εἴδετε ἐν τῇ μάχῃ τῇδε , ταῦτα ἐνθυμούμενοι μήποτε παύεσθε , ἵνα παρ’ ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς αἰεὶ κρίνητε πότερον ἡ ἀρετὴ μᾶλλον ἢ ἡ φυγὴ σῴζει τὰς ψυχὰς καὶ πότερον οἱ μάχεσθαι ἐθέλοντες ῥᾷον ἀπαλλάττουσιν ἢ οἱ οὐκ ἐθέλοντες , καὶ ποίαν τινὰ ἡδονὴν τὸ νικᾶν παρέχει ·
never cease to bear in mind what you have just seen in this day’s battle, so that you may always judge in your own hearts whether courage is more likely to save men’s lives than running away, and whether it is easier for those to withdraw who wish to fight than for those who are unwilling, and what sort of pleasure victory brings;


4.1.5
1721
ταῦτα γὰρ νῦν ἄριστ’ ἂν κρίναιτε πεῖράν τε αὐτῶν ἔχοντες καὶ ἄρτι γεγενημένου τοῦ πράγματος .
for you can best judge of these matters now when you have experience of them and while the event is of so recent occurrence.


4.1.6
1722
καὶ ταῦτα μέν , ἔφη , ἀεὶ διανοούμενοι βελτίους ἂν εἴητε ·
And if you would always keep this in mind, you would be more valiant men.


4.1.6
1723
νῦν δὲ ὡς θεοφιλεῖς καὶ ἀγαθοὶ καὶ σώφρονες ἄνδρες δειπνοποιεῖσθε καὶ σπονδὰς τοῖς θεοῖς ποιεῖσθε καὶ παιᾶνα ἐξάρχεσθε καὶ ἅμα τὸ παραγγελλόμενον προνοεῖτε .
Now go to dinner, as men beloved of God and brave and wise; pour libations to the gods, raise the song of victory, and at the same time be on the lookout for orders that may come.


4.1.7
1724
εἰπὼν δὲ ταῦτα ἀναβὰς ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον ἤλασε καὶ πρὸς Κυαξάρην ἐλθὼν καὶ συνησθεὶς ἐκείνῳ κοινῇ ὡς εἰκὸς καὶ ἰδὼν τ- ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐρόμενος εἴ τι δέοιτο , ἀπήλαυνεν εἰς τὸ αὑτοῦ στράτευμα .
When he had said this, he mounted his horse and rode away to Cyaxares.


4.1.7
1725
καὶ οἱ μὲν δὴ ἀμφὶ Κῦρον δειπνοποιησάμενοι καὶ φυλακὰς καταστησάμενοι ὡς ἔδει ἐκοιμήθησαν .
They exchanged congratulations, as was fitting, and after Cyrus had taken note of matters there and asked if there were anything he could do, he rode back to his own army. Then he and his followers dined, stationed their pickets duly, and went to rest.


4.1.8
1726
οἱ δὲ Ἀσσύριοι , ἅτε καὶ τεθνηκότος τοῦ ἄρχοντος καὶ σχεδὸν σὺν αὐτῷ τῶν βελτίστων , ἠθύμουν μὲν πάντες , πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ ἀπεδίδρασκον αὐτῶν τῆς νυκτὸς ἐκ τοῦ στρατοπέδου .
The Assyrians, on the other hand, inasmuch as they had lost their general and with him nearly all their best men, were all disheartened, and many of them even ran away from the camp in the course of the night.


4.1.8
1727
ὁρῶντες δὲ ταῦτα ὅ τε Κροῖσος καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι σύμμαχοι αὐτῶν ἠθύμουν ·
And when Croesus and the rest of their allies saw this, they too lost heart;


4.1.8
1728
πάντα μὲν γὰρ ἦν χαλεπά ·
for the whole situation was desperate;


4.1.8
1729
ἀθυμίαν δὲ πλείστην παρεῖχε πᾶσιν ὅτι τὸ ἡγούμενον τῆς στρατιᾶς φῦλον διέφθαρτο τὰς γνώμας .
but what caused the greatest despondency in all was the fact that the leading contingent of the army had become thoroughly demoralized.


4.1.8
1730
οὕτω δὴ ἐκλείπουσι τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ ἀπέρχονται τῆς νυκτός .
Thus dispirited, then, they quitted their camp and departed under cover of the night.


4.1.9
1731
ὡς δ’ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο καὶ ἔρημον ἀνδρῶν ἐφάνη τὸ τῶν πολεμίων στρατόπεδον , εὐθὺς διαβιβάζει ὁ Κῦρος τοὺς Πέρσας πρώτους ·
And when it became day and the enemy’s camp was found to be forsaken of men, Cyrus at once led his Persians first across the entrenchments.


4.1.9
1732
κατελέλειπτο δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων πολλὰ μὲν πρόβατα , πολλοὶ δὲ βόες , πολλαὶ δὲ ἅμαξαι πολλῶν ἀγαθῶν μεσταί ·
And many sheep and many cattle and many wagons packed full of good things had been left behind by the enemy.


4.1.9
1733
ἐκ δὲ τούτου διέβαινον ἤδη καὶ οἱ ἀμφὶ Κυαξάρην Μῆδοι πάντες καὶ ἠριστοποιοῦντο ἐνταῦθα .
Directly after this, Cyaxares also and all his Medes crossed over and had breakfast there.


4.1.10
1734
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠρίστησαν , συνεκάλεσεν ὁ Κῦρος τοὺς αὑτοῦ ταξιάρχους καὶ ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
And when they had breakfasted, Cyrus called together his captains and spoke as follows:


4.1.10
1735
οἷά μοι δοκοῦμεν καὶ ὅσα ἀγαθά , ὦ ἄνδρες , ἀφεῖναι , θεῶν ἡμῖν αὐτὰ διδόντων .
What good things, fellow-soldiers, and how great, have we let slip, it seems, while the gods were delivering them into our hands!


4.1.10
1736
νῦν γὰρ ὅτι οἱ πολέμιοι ἡμᾶς ἀποδεδράκασιν αὐτοὶ ὁρᾶτε ·
Why, you see with your own eyes that the enemy have run away from us;


4.1.10
1737
οἵτινες δὲ ἐν ἐρύματι ὄντες ἐκλιπόντες τοῦτο φεύγουσι , πῶς ἄν τις τούτους οἴοιτ’ ἂν μεῖναι ἰδόντας ἡμᾶς ἐν τῷ ἰσοπέδῳ ;
when people behind fortifications abandon them and flee, how would any one expect them to stand and fight, if they met us in a fair and open field?


4.1.10
1738
οἵτινες δὲ ἡμῶν ἄπειροι ὄντες οὐχ ὑπέμειναν , πῶς νῦν γ’ ἂν ὑπομείνειαν , ἐπεὶ ἥττηνταί τε καὶ πολλὰ κακὰ ὑφ’ ἡμῶν πεπόνθασιν ;
And if they did not stand their ground when they were yet unacquainted with us, how would they withstand us now, when they have been defeated and have suffered heavy loss at our hands?


4.1.10
1739
ὧν δὲ οἱ βέλτιστοι ἀπολώλασι , πῶς οἱ πονηρότεροι ἐκείνων μάχεσθαι ἂν ἡμῖν ἐθέλοιεν ;
And when their bravest men have been slain, how would their more cowardly be willing to fight us?


4.1.11
1740
καί τις εἶπε ·
Why not pursue them as swiftly as possible, said one of the men;


4.1.11
1741
τί οὖν οὐ διώκομεν ὡς τάχιστα , καταδήλων γε οὕτω τῶν ἀγαθῶν ὄντων ;
now that the good things we have let slip are so manifest to us?


4.1.11
1742
καὶ ὃς εἶπεν ·
Because, he replied,


4.1.11
1743
ὅτι ἵππων προσδεόμεθα ·
we have not horses enough;


4.1.11
1744
οἱ μὲν γὰρ κράτιστοι τῶν πολεμίων , οὓς μάλιστα καιρὸς ἦν ἢ λαβεῖν ἢ κατακανεῖν , οὗτοι ἐφ’ ἵππων ὀχοῦνται ·
for the best of the enemy, those whom it were most desirable either to capture or to kill, are riding off on horseback.


4.1.11
1745
οὓς ἡμεῖς τρέπεσθαι μὲν σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς ἱκανοί , διώκοντες δὲ αἱρεῖν οὐχ ἱκανοί .
With the help of the gods we were able to put them to flight, but we are not able to pursue and overtake them.


4.1.12
1746
τί οὖν , ἔφασαν , οὐκ ἐλθὼν Κυαξάρῃ λέγεις ταῦτα ;
Then why do you not go and tell Cyaxares this? said they.


4.1.12
1747
καὶ ὃς εἶπε ·
Come with me, then, all of you, he answered,


4.1.12
1748
συνέπεσθε τοίνυν μοι πάντες , ὡς εἰδῇ ὅτι πᾶσιν ἡμῖν ταῦτα δοκεῖ .
so that he may know that we are all agreed upon this point.


4.1.12
1749
ἐκ τούτου εἵποντό τε πάντες καὶ ἔλεγον οἷα ἐπιτήδεια ἐδόκουν εἶναι ὑπὲρ ὧν ἐδέοντο .
Thereupon they all followed and submitted such arguments as they thought calculated to gain their object.


4.1.13
1750
καὶ ὁ Κυαξάρης ἅμα μὲν ὅτι ἐκεῖνοι ἦρχον τοῦ λόγου , ὥσπερ ὑπεφθόνει ·
Now Cyaxares seemed to feel some little jealousy because the proposal came from them;


4.1.13
1751
ἅμα δ’ ἴσως καλῶς ἔχειν ἐδόκει αὐτῷ μὴ πάλιν κινδυνεύειν ·
at the same time, perhaps, he did not care to risk another engagement;


4.1.13
1752
καὶ γὰρ αὐτός τε περὶ εὐθυμίαν ἐτύγχανεν ὢν καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Μήδων ἑώρα πολλοὺς τὸ αὐτὸ ποιοῦντας ·
then, too, he rather wished to stay where he was, for it happened that he was busily engaged in making merry himself, and he saw that many of the other Medes were doing the same.


4.1.13
1753
εἶπε δ’ οὖν ὧδε .
However that may be, he spoke as follows:


4.1.14
1754
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Κῦρε , ὅτι μὲν κάλλιστα ἀνθρώπων μελετᾶτε ὑμεῖς οἱ Πέρσαι μηδὲ πρὸς μίαν ἡδονὴν ἀπλήστως διακεῖσθαι καὶ ὁρῶν καὶ ἀκούων οἶδα ·
Well, Cyrus, I know from what I see and hear that you Persians are more careful than other people not to incline to the least intemperance in any kind of pleasure.


4.1.14
1755
ἐμοὶ δὲ δοκεῖ τῆς μεγίστης ἡδονῆς πολὺ μάλιστα συμφέρειν ἐγκρατῆ εἶναι .
But it seems to me that it is much better to be moderate in the greatest pleasure than to be moderate in lesser pleasures;


4.1.14
1756
μείζω δὲ ἡδονὴν τί παρέχει ἀνθρώποις εὐτυχίας ἣ νῦν ἡμῖν παραγεγένηται ;
and what brings to man greater pleasure than success, such as has now been granted us?


4.1.15
1757
ἢν μὲν τοίνυν , ἐπεὶ εὐτυχοῦμεν , σωφρόνως διαφυλάττωμεν αὐτήν , ἴσως δυναίμεθ’ ἂν ἀκινδύνως εὐδαιμονοῦντες γηρᾶν ·
If, therefore, when we are successful, we follow up our success with moderation, we might, perhaps, be able to grow old in happiness unalloyed with danger.


4.1.15
1758
εἰ δ’ ἀπλήστως χρώμενοι ταύτῃ ἄλλην καὶ ἄλλην πειρασόμεθα διώκειν , ὁρᾶτε μὴ πάθωμεν ἅπερ πολλοὺς μὲν λέγουσιν ἐν θαλάττῃ πεπονθέναι , διὰ τὸ εὐτυχεῖν οὐκ ἐθέλοντας παύσασθαι πλέοντας ἀπολέσθαι ·
But if we enjoy it intemperately and try to pursue first one success and then another, see to it that we do not share the same fate that they say many have suffered upon the sea, that is, because of their success they have not been willing to give up seafaring, and so they have been lost;


4.1.15
1759
πολλοὺς δὲ νίκης τυχόντας ἑτέρας ἐφιεμένους καὶ τὴν πρόσθεν ἀποβαλεῖν .
and many others, when they have gained a victory, have aimed at another and so have lost even what they gained by the first.


4.1.16
1760
καὶ γὰρ εἰ μὲν οἱ πολέμιοι ἥττους ὄντες ἡμῶν ἔφευγον , ἴσως ἂν καὶ διώκειν τοὺς ἥττους ἀσφαλῶς εἶχε .
And that is the way with us; for if it were because they were inferior to us in numbers that the enemy are fleeing from us, perhaps it might be safe for us actually to pursue this lesser army.


4.1.16
1761
νῦν δὲ κατανόησον πόστῳ μέρει αὐτῶν πάντες μαχεσάμενοι νενικήκαμεν ·
But, as it is, reflect with what a mere fraction of their numbers we, with all our forces, have fought and won,


4.1.16
1762
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἄμαχοί εἰσιν ·
while the rest of theirs have not tasted of battle;


4.1.16
1763
οὓς εἰ μὲν μὴ ἀναγκάσομεν μάχεσθαι , ἀγνοοῦντες καὶ ἡμᾶς καὶ ἑαυτοὺς δι’ ἀμαθίαν καὶ μαλακίαν ἀπίασιν ·
and if we do not compel them to fight, they will remain unacquainted with our strength and with their own, and they will go away because of their ignorance and cowardice.


4.1.16
1764
εἰ δὲ γνώσονται ὅτι ἀπιόντες οὐδὲν ἧττον κινδυνεύουσιν ἢ μένοντες , ὅπως μὴ ἀναγκάσομεν αὐτούς , κἂν μὴ βούλωνται , ἀγαθοὺς γενέσθαι .
But if they discover that they are in no less danger if they go away than if they remain in the field, beware lest we compel them to be valiant even against their will.


4.1.17
1765
ἴσθι γὰρ ὅτι οὐ σὺ μᾶλλον τὰς ἐκείνων γυναῖκας καὶ παῖδας λαβεῖν ἐπιθυμεῖς ἢ ἐκεῖνοι σῶσαι .
And let me assure you that you are not more eager to capture their women and children than they are to save them.


4.1.17
1766
ἐννόει δ’ ὅτι καὶ αἱ σύες ἐπειδὰν ὀφθῶσι , φεύγουσι , κἂν πολλαὶ ὦσι , σὺν τοῖς τέκνοις ·
And bethink you that even wild swine flee with their young, when they are discovered, no matter how great their numbers may be;


4.1.17
1767
ἐπειδὰν δέ τις αὐτῶν θηρᾷ τι τῶν τέκνων , οὐκέτι φεύγει οὐδ’ ἢν μία τύχῃ οὖσα , ἀλλ’ ἵεται ἐπὶ τὸν λαμβάνειν πειρώμενον .
but if any one tries to catch one of the young, the old one, even if she happens to be the only one, does not think of flight but rushes upon the man who is trying to effect the capture.


4.1.18
1768
καὶ νῦν μὲν κατακλείσαντες ἑαυτοὺς εἰς ἔρυμα παρέσχον ἡμῖν ταμιεύεσθαι ὥσθ’ ὁπόσοις ἐβουλόμεθα αὐτῶν μάχεσθαι ·
And now, when they had shut themselves up in their fortifications, they allowed us to manage things so as to fight as many at a time as we pleased.


4.1.18
1769
εἰ δ’ ἐν εὐρυχωρίᾳ πρόσιμεν αὐτοῖς καὶ μαθήσονται χωρὶς γενόμενοι οἱ μὲν κατὰ πρόσωπον ἡμῖν ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν ἐναντιοῦσθαι , οἱ δ’ ἐκ πλαγίου , οἱ δὲ καὶ ὄπισθεν , ὅρα μὴ πολλῶν ἑκάστῳ ἡμῶν χειρῶν δεήσει καὶ ὀφθαλμῶν .
But if we go against them in an open plain and they learn to meet us in separate detachments, some in front of us (as even now), some on either flank, and some in our rear, see to it that we do not each one of us stand in need of many hands and many eyes.


4.1.18
1770
προσέτι δ’ οὐδ’ ἂν ἐθέλοιμ’ , ἔφη , ἐγὼ νῦν , ὁρῶν Μήδους εὐθυμουμένους , ἐξαναστήσας ἀναγκάζειν κινδυνεύσοντας ἰέναι .
And besides, said he, now that I see the Medes making merry, I should not like to rout them out and compel them to go into danger.


4.1.19
1771
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ὑπολαβὼν εἶπεν ·
Nay said Cyrus in reply;


4.1.19
1772
ἀλλὰ σύγε μηδένα ἀναγκάσῃς , ἀλλὰ τοὺς ἐθέλοντάς μοι ἕπεσθαι δός ·
please do not place anybody under compulsion; but allow those who will volunteer to follow me,


4.1.19
1773
καὶ ἴσως ἂν σοὶ καὶ τῶν σῶν φίλων τούτων ἥκοιμεν ἑκάστῳ ἄγοντες ἐφ’ οἷς ἅπαντες εὐθυμήσεσθε .
and perhaps we may come back bringing to you and each of your friends here something for you all to make merry with.


4.1.19
1774
τὸ μὲν γὰρ πλῆθος ἡμεῖς γε τῶν πολεμίων οὐδὲ διωξόμεθα ·
For the main body of the enemy we certainly shall not even pursue;


4.1.19
1775
πῶς γὰρ ἂν καὶ καταλάβοιμεν ;
for how could we ever overtake them?


4.1.19
1776
ἢν δέ τι ἢ ἀπεσχισμένον τοῦ στρατεύματος λάβωμεν ἤ τι ὑπολειπόμενον , ἥξομεν πρὸς σὲ ἄγοντες .
But if we find any detachment of their army straggling or left behind, we shall bring them to you.


4.1.20
1777
ἐννόει δ’ , ἔφη , ὅτι καὶ ἡμεῖς , ἐπεὶ σὺ ἐδέου , ἤλθομεν σοὶ χαριζόμενοι μακρὰν ὁδόν ·
And remember, he added, that we also, when you asked us, came a long journey to do you a favour;


4.1.20
1778
καὶ σὺ οὖν ἡμῖν δίκαιος εἶ ἀντιχαρίζεσθαι , ἵνα καὶ ἔχοντές τι οἴκαδ’ ἀφικώμεθα καὶ μὴ εἰς τὸν σὸν θησαυρὸν πάντες ὁρῶμεν .
and it is therefore only fair that you should do us a favour in return, so that we may not have to go home empty-handed nor always be looking to your treasury here for support.


4.1.21
1779
ἐνταῦθα δὴ ἔλεξεν ὁ Κυαξάρης ·
Cyaxares then said;


4.1.21
1780
ἀλλ’ εἴ γε μέντοι ἐθέλων τις ἕποιτο , καὶ χάριν ἔγωγέ σοι εἰδείην ἄν .
Very well, if indeed any one will volunteer to follow you, I for my part should be really grateful to you.


4.1.21
1781
σύμπεμψον τοίνυν μοί τινα , ἔφη , τῶν ἀξιοπίστων τούτων , ὃς ἐρεῖ ἃ ἂν σὺ ἐπιστείλῃς .
Well, then, said he, send with me some one of these notables in positions of trust to announce your commands.


4.1.21
1782
λαβὼν δὴ ἴθι , ἔφη , ὅντινα ἐθέλεις τουτωνί ·
Take any of them you wish, said the other, and go.


4.1.22
1783
ἔνθα δὴ ἔτυχε παρὼν ὁ φήσας ποτὲ συγγενὴς αὐτοῦ εἶναι καὶ φιληθείς .
Now it happened that the man who had once pretended to be a kinsman of his and had got a kiss from him was present there.


4.1.22
1784
εὐθὺς οὖν ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Cyrus, therefore, said at once:


4.1.22
1785
ἀρκεῖ μοι , ἔφη , οὑτοσί .
This man will do.


4.1.22
1786
οὗτος τοίνυν σοι ἑπέσθω .
Let him follow you, then, said Cyaxares.


4.1.22
1787
καὶ λέγε σύ , ἔφη , τὸν ἐθέλοντα ἰέναι μετὰ Κύρου .
And do you, he added to Artabazus, say that whoever will may go with Cyrus.


4.1.23
1788
οὕτω δὴ λαβὼν τὸν ἄνδρα ἐξῄει .
So then he took the man and went away.


4.1.23
1789
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐξῆλθον , ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε ·
And when they had come out, Cyrus said:


4.1.23
1790
νῦν δὴ σὺ δηλώσεις εἰ ἀληθῆ ἔλεγες , ὅτε ἔφης ἥδεσθαι θεώμενος ἐμέ .
Now then, you shall prove if you spoke the truth when you said that you liked to look at me.


4.1.23
1791
οὔκουν ἀπολείψομαί γέ σου , ἔφη ὁ Μῆδος , εἰ τοῦτο λέγεις .
If you talk that way, said the Mede, I shall never leave you.


4.1.23
1792
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
And Cyrus said:


4.1.23
1793
οὐκοῦν καὶ ἄλλους , ἔφη , προθύμως ἐξάξεις ;
Will you do your best, then, to bring others also with you?


4.1.23
1794
ἐπομόσας οὖν ἐκεῖνος νὴ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφη , ἔστε γ’ ἂν ποιήσω καὶ σὲ ἐμὲ ἡδέως θεᾶσθαι .
Yes, by Zeus, he answered with an oath, to such an extent that I shall make you also glad to look at me.


4.1.24
1795
τότε δὴ καὶ ἐκπεμφθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ Κυαξάρου τά τε ἄλλα προθύμως ἀπήγγελλε τοῖς Μήδοις καὶ προσετίθει ὅτι αὐτός γε οὐκ ἀπολείψοιτο ἀνδρὸς καλλίστου καὶ ἀρίστου , καὶ τὸ μέγιστον , ἀπὸ θεῶν γεγονότος .
Then, as he had his commission from Cyaxares also, he not only gave his message to the Medes with enthusiasm, but he added that, for his part, he himself would never leave the noblest and best of men, and what was more than all, a man descended from the gods.


4.2.1
1796
πράττοντος δὲ τοῦ Κύρου ταῦτα θείως πως ἀφικνοῦνται ἀπὸ Ὑρκανίων ἄγγελοι .
While Cyrus was thus occupied, messengers came as if providentially from the Hyrcanians.


4.2.1
1797
οἱ δὲ Ὑρκάνιοι ὅμοροι μὲν τῶν Ἀσσυρίων εἰσίν , ἔθνος δ’ οὐ πολύ , διὸ καὶ ὑπήκοοι ἦσαν τῶν Ἀσσυρίων ·
Now the Hyrcanians are neighbours of the Assyrians; they are not a large nation; and for that reason they also were subjects of the Assyrians.


4.2.1
1798
εὔιπποι δὲ καὶ τότε ἐδόκουν εἶναι καὶ νῦν ἔτι δοκοῦσιν ·
Even then they had a reputation for being good horsemen, and they have that reputation still.


4.2.1
1799
διὸ καὶ ἐχρῶντο αὐτοῖς οἱ Ἀσσύριοι ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τοῖς Σκιρίταις , οὐδὲν φειδόμενοι αὐτῶν οὔτ’ ἐν πόνοις οὔτ’ ἐν κινδύνοις ·
For this reason the Assyrians used to employ them as the Spartans do the Sciritae, sparing them neither in hardships nor in dangers.


4.2.1
1800
καὶ δὴ καὶ τότε ὀπισθοφυλακεῖν ἐκέλευον αὐτοὺς ὡς χιλίους ἱππέας ὄντας , ὅπως εἴ τι ὄπισθεν δεινὸν εἴη , ἐκεῖνοι πρὸ αὐτῶν τοῦτ’ ἔχοιεν .
And on that particular occasion they were ordered to bring up the rear (they were cavalrymen about a thousand strong), in order that, if any danger should threaten from behind, they might have to bear the brunt of it instead of the Assyrians.


4.2.2
1801
οἱ δὲ Ὑρκάνιοι , ἅτε μέλλοντες ὕστατοι πορεύεσθαι , καὶ τὰς ἁμάξας τὰς ἑαυτῶν καὶ τοὺς οἰκέτας ὑστάτους εἶχον .
But as the Hyrcanians were to march in the very rear, they had their wagons also and their families in the rear.


4.2.2
1802
στρατεύονται γὰρ δὴ οἱ κατὰ τὴν Ἀσίαν ἔχοντες οἱ πολλοὶ μεθ’ ὧνπερ καὶ οἰκοῦσι ·
For, as we know, most of the Asiatic peoples take the field accompanied by their entire households.


4.2.2
1803
καὶ τότε δὴ ἐστρατεύοντο οὕτως οἱ Ὑρκάνιοι .
So in this particular campaign, the Hyrcanians had taken the field thus attended.


4.2.3
1804
ἐννοηθέντες δὲ οἷά τε πάσχουσιν ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ὅτι νῦν τεθναίη μὲν ὁ ἄρχων αὐτῶν , ἡττημένοι δ’ εἶεν , φόβος δ’ ἐνείη τῷ στρατεύματι , οἱ δὲ σύμμαχοι αὐτῶν ὡς ἀθύμως ἔχοιεν καὶ ἀπολείποιεν , ταῦτα ἐνθυμουμένοις ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς νῦν καλὸν εἶναι ἀποστῆναι , εἰ θέλοιεν οἱ ἀμφὶ Κῦρον συνεπιθέσθαι .
But as they reflected how they were being treated by the Assyrians, that the Assyrian monarch was now slain and the army defeated, that there was great panic throughout the ranks, and that the allies were discouraged and deserting — as they thought over these conditions, they decided that now was a good opportunity to revolt, if Cyrus and his followers would join them in an attack.


4.2.3
1805
καὶ πέμπουσιν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Κῦρον ·
So they sent envoys to Cyrus ;


4.2.3
1806
ἀπὸ γὰρ τῆς μάχης τὸ τούτου ὄνομα μέγιστον ηὔξητο .
for in consequence of the battle his name had been very greatly magnified.


4.2.4
1807
οἱ δὲ πεμφθέντες λέγουσι Κύρῳ ὅτι μισοῖέν τε τοὺς Ἀσσυρίους δικαίως , νῦν τ’ , εἰ βούλοιτο ἰέναι ἐπ’ αὐτούς , καὶ σφεῖς σύμμαχοι ὑπάρξοιεν καὶ ἡγήσοιντο ·
And those who were sent told Cyrus that they had good reason to hate the Assyrians and that now, if he would proceed against them, they would be his allies and his guides as well.


4.2.4
1808
ἅμα δὲ πρὸς τούτοις διηγοῦντο τὰ τῶν πολεμίων ὡς ἔχοι , ἐπαίρειν βουλόμενοι μάλιστα στρατεύεσθαι αὐτόν .
And at the same time they also gave him an account of the enemy’s plight, for they wished above all things to incite him to push the campaign.


4.2.5
1809
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἐπήρετο αὐτούς ·
Cyrus asked them:


4.2.5
1810
καὶ δοκεῖτε ἄν , ἔφη , ἔτι ἡμᾶς καταλαβεῖν αὐτοὺς πρὶν ἐν τοῖς ἐρύμασιν εἶναι ;
Do you really think, that we could still overtake them before they reach their strongholds?


4.2.5
1811
ἡμεῖς μὲν γάρ , ἔφη , μάλα συμφορὰν τοῦτο ἡγούμεθα ὅτι ἔλαθον ἡμᾶς ἀποδράντες .
For we, he added, consider it hard luck that they have run away from us when we were not watching.


4.2.5
1812
ταῦτα δ’ ἔλεγε βουλόμενος αὐτοὺς ὡς μέγιστον φρονεῖν ἐπὶ σφίσιν .
Now he said this to make them think as highly as possible of his troops.


4.2.6
1813
οἱ δὲ ἀπεκρίναντο ὅτι καὶ αὔριον , ἕωθεν εἰ εὔζωνοι πορεύοιντο , καταλήψοιντο ·
They answered that if Cyrus and his army would start out at daybreak in light marching order, he would come up with them the next day:


4.2.6
1814
ὑπὸ γὰρ τοῦ ὄχλου καὶ τῶν ἁμαξῶν σχολῇ πορεύεσθαι αὐτούς ·
for because their numbers were so vast and so encumbered with baggage, the enemy were marching slowly.


4.2.6
1815
καὶ ἅμα , ἔφασαν , τὴν προτέραν νύκτα ἀγρυπνήσαντες νῦν μικρὸν προελθόντες ἐστρατοπέδευνται .
And besides, they said, as they had no sleep last night, they have gone ahead only a little way and are now encamped.


4.2.7
1816
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἔφη ·
Cyrus asked,


4.2.7
1817
ἔχετε οὖν ὧν λέγετε πιστόν τι ἡμᾶς διδάσκειν ὡς ἀληθεύετε ;
Have you, then, any surety to give us, to prove that what you say is true?


4.2.7
1818
ὁμήρους γ’ , ἔφασαν , ἐθέλομεν αὐτίκα ἐλάσαντες τῆς νυκτὸς ἀγαγεῖν ·
Yes, they answered, we are ready to ride away and bring you hostages this very night.


4.2.7
1819
μόνον καὶ σὺ ἡμῖν πιστὰ θεῶν πεποίησο καὶ δεξιὰν δός , ἵνα φέρωμεν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις τὰ αὐτὰ ἅπερ ἂν αὐτοὶ λάβωμεν παρὰ σοῦ .
Only do you also give us assurance in the name of the gods and give us your right hand, that we may give to the rest of our people, too, the same assurance that we receive from you.


4.2.8
1820
ἐκ τούτου τὰ πιστὰ δίδωσιν αὐτοῖς ἦ μήν , ἐὰν ἐμπεδώσωσιν ἃ λέγουσιν , ὡς φίλοις καὶ πιστοῖς χρήσεσθαι αὐτοῖς , ὡς μήτε Περσῶν μήτε Μήδων μεῖον ἔχειν παρ’ ἑαυτῷ .
Thereupon he gave them his solemn promise that, if they should make good their statements, he would treat them as his true friends, so that they should count for no less in his esteem than the Persians or the Medes.


4.2.8
1821
καὶ νῦν ἔστιν ἔτι ἰδεῖν Ὑρκανίους καὶ πιστευομένους καὶ ἀρχὰς ἔχοντας , ὥσπερ καὶ Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων οἳ ἂν δοκῶσιν ἄξιοι εἶναι .
And even to this day one may see the Hyrcanians holding positions of trust and authority, just like those of the Persians and Medes who are thought to be deserving.


4.2.9
1822
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐδείπνησαν , ἐξῆγε τὸ στράτευμα ἔτι φάους ὄντος , καὶ τοὺς Ὑρκανίους περιμένειν ἐκέλευσεν , ἵνα ἅμα ἴοιεν .
When they had dined, he led out his army while it was still daylight, and he bade the Hyrcanians wait for him that they might go together.


4.2.9
1823
οἱ μὲν δὴ Πέρσαι , ὥσπερ εἰκός , πάντες ἐξῇσαν , καὶ Τιγράνης ἔχων τὸ αὑτοῦ στράτευμα ·
Now the Persians, as was to be expected, came out to a man to go with him, and Tigranes came with his army;


4.2.10
1824
τῶν δὲ Μήδων ἐξῇσαν οἱ μὲν διὰ τὸ παιδὶ ὄντι Κύρῳ παῖδες ὄντες φίλοι γενέσθαι , οἱ δὲ διὰ τὸ ἐν θήραις συγγενόμενοι ἀγασθῆναι αὐτοῦ τὸν τρόπον , οἱ δὲ διὰ τὸ καὶ χάριν εἰδέναι ὅτι μέγαν αὐτοῖς φόβον ἀπεληλακέναι ἐδόκει , οἱ δὲ καὶ ἐλπίδας ἔχοντες , διὰ τὸ ἄνδρα φαίνεσθαι ἀγαθὸν καὶ εὐτυχῆ , καὶ μέγαν ἔτι ἰσχυρῶς ἔσεσθαι αὐτόν , οἱ δέ , ὅτε ἐτρέφετο ἐν Μήδοις , εἴ τι ἀγαθόν τῳ συνέπραξεν , ἀντιχαρίζεσθαι ἐβούλοντο ·
while of the Medes some came out because as boys they had been friends of Cyrus when he was a boy, others because they liked his ways when they had been with him on the chase, others because they were grateful to him for freeing them, as they thought, from great impending danger, and still others because they cherished the hope that as he seemed to be a man of ability he would one day be exceedingly successful and exceedingly great besides; others wished to requite him for some service he had done for them while he was growing up in Media;


4.2.10
1825
πολλοῖς δὲ πολλὰ διὰ φιλανθρωπίαν παρὰ τοῦ πάππου ἀγαθὰ διεπέπρακτο ·
many, too, owed to his kindness of heart many a favour at the hands of his grandfather;


4.2.10
1826
πολλοὶ δ’ , ἐπεὶ καὶ τοὺς Ὑρκανίους εἶδον καὶ λόγος διῆλθεν ὡς ἡγήσοιντο ἐπὶ πολλὰ ἀγαθά , ἐξῇσαν καὶ τοῦ λαβεῖν τι ἕνεκα .
and many, when they saw the Hyrcanians and when the report spread that these would lead them to rich plunder, came out (apart from other motives) for the sake of getting some gain.


4.2.11
1827
οὕτω δὴ ἐξῆλθον σχεδὸν ἅπαντες καὶ οἱ Μῆδοι πλὴν ὅσοι σὺν Κυαξάρῃ ἔτυχον σκηνοῦντες ·
The result was that almost all came out — even the Medes, except those who happened to be feasting in the same tent with Cyaxares;


4.2.11
1828
οὗτοι δὲ κατέμενον καὶ οἱ τούτων ὑπήκοοι .
these and their subordinates remained behind.


4.2.11
1829
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι πάντες φαιδρῶς καὶ προθύμως ἐξωρμῶντο , ἅτε οὐκ ἀνάγκῃ ἀλλ’ ἐθελούσιοι καὶ χάριτος ἕνεκα ἐξιόντες .
But all the rest hastened out cheerily and enthusiastically, for they came not from compulsion but of their own free will and out of gratitude.


4.2.12
1830
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἔξω ἦσαν , πρῶτον μὲν πρὸς τοὺς Μήδους ἐλθὼν ἐπῄνεσέ τε αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπηύξατο μάλιστα μὲν θεοὺς αὐτοῖς ἵλεως ἡγεῖσθαι καὶ σφίσιν , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς δυνασθῆναι χάριν αὐτοῖς ταύτης τῆς προθυμίας ἀποδοῦναι .
And when they were out of the camp, he went first to the Medes and praised them and prayed the gods above all things graciously to lead them and his own men, and he prayed also that he himself might be enabled to reward them for this zeal of theirs.


4.2.12
1831
τέλος δ’ εἶπεν ὅτι ἡγήσοιντο μὲν αὐτοῖς οἱ πεζοί , ἐκείνους δ’ ἕπεσθαι σὺν τοῖς ἵπποις ἐκέλευσε ·
In concluding, he stated that the infantry should go first, and he ordered the Medes to follow with their cavalry.


4.2.12
1832
καὶ ὅπου ἂν ἀναπαύωνται ἢ ἐπίσχωσι τῆς πορείας , ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς πρὸς αὑτὸν παρελαύνειν τινάς , ἵνα εἰδῶσι τὸ ἀεὶ καίριον .
And wherever they were to rest or halt from their march, he enjoined it upon them that some of their number should always come to him, that they might know the need of the hour.


4.2.13
1833
ἐκ τούτου ἡγεῖσθαι ἐκέλευε τοὺς Ὑρκανίους .
Then he ordered the Hyrcanians to lead the way.


4.2.13
1834
καὶ οἳ ἠρώτων τί δέ ;
What! they exclaimed,


4.2.13
1835
οὐκ ἀναμενεῖς , ἔφασαν , τοὺς ὁμήρους ἕως ἂν ἀγάγωμεν , ἵνα ἔχων καὶ σὺ τὰ πιστὰ παρ’ ἡμῶν πορεύῃ ;
are you not going to wait until we bring the hostages, that you also may have a guarantee of our good faith before you proceed?


4.2.13
1836
καὶ τὸν ἀποκρίνασθαι λέγεται ·
He is said to have answered;


4.2.13
1837
ἐννοῶ γάρ , φάναι , ὅτι ἔχομεν τὰ πιστὰ ἐν ταῖς ἡμετέραις ψυχαῖς καὶ ταῖς ἡμετέραις χερσίν .
for I consider that we have the guarantee in our own hearts and hands.


4.2.13
1838
οὕτω γὰρ δοκοῦμεν περεσκευάσθαι ὡς ἢν μὲν ἀληθεύητε , ἱκανοὶ εἶναι ἡμᾶς εὖ ποιεῖν ·
For it is with these, I think, that we are in a position to do you a service, if you speak the truth;


4.2.13
1839
ἢν δὲ ἐξαπατᾶτε , οὕτω νομίζομεν ἔχειν ὡς οὐχ ἡμᾶς ἐφ’ ὑμῖν ἔσεσθαι , ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον , ἢν οἱ θεοὶ θέλωσιν , ὑμᾶς ἐφ’ ἡμῖν γενήσεσθαι .
but if you are trying to deceive us, we think that, as things are, we shall not be in your power, but rather, if the gods will, you shall be in ours.


4.2.13
1840
καὶ μέντοι , ἔφη , ὦ Ὑρκάνιοι , ἐπείπερ φατὲ ὑστάτους ἕπεσθαι τοὺς ὑμετέρους , ἐπειδὰν ἴδητε αὐτούς , σημήνατε ἡμῖν ὅτι οἱ ὑμέτεροί εἰσιν , ἵνα φειδώμεθα αὐτῶν .
And hark you, men of Hyrcania, said he, as you say that your people are bringing up the enemy’s rear, inform us, as soon as you see them, that they are yours, that we may do them no harm.


4.2.14
1841
ἀκούσαντες δὲ ταῦτα οἱ Ὑρκάνιοι τὴν μὲν ὁδὸν ἡγοῦντο ὥσπερ ἐκέλευε , τὴν δὲ ῥώμην τῆς ψυχῆς ἐθαύμαζον ·
When the Hyrcanians heard this, they led the way, as he ordered.


4.2.14
1842
καὶ οὔτε Ἀσσυρίους οὔτε Λυδοὺς οὔτε τοὺς συμμάχους αὐτῶν ἐφοβοῦντο , ἀλλὰ μὴ παντάπασιν ὁ Κῦρος μικράν τινα αὐτῶν οἴοιτο ῥοπὴν εἶναι καὶ προσόντων καὶ ἀπόντων .
They wondered at his magnanimity; and they no longer had any fear of either the Assyrians or the Lydians or their allies, but they feared only lest he should think that it was not of the slightest moment whether they joined him or not.


4.2.15
1843
πορευομένων δὲ ἐπεὶ νὺξ ἐπεγένετο , λέγεται φῶς τῷ Κύρῳ καὶ τῷ στρατεύματι ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ προφανὲς γενέσθαι , ὥστε πᾶσι μὲν φρίκην ἐγγίγνεσθαι πρὸς τὸ θεῖον , θάρρος δὲ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους .
As they proceeded, night came on, and it is said that a light from heaven shone forth upon Cyrus and his army, so that they were all filled with awe at the miracle but with courage to meet the enemy.


4.2.15
1844
ὡς δ’ εὔζωνοί τε καὶ ταχὺ ἐπορεύοντο , εἰκότως πολλήν τε ὁδὸν διήνυσαν καὶ ἅμα κνέφᾳ πλησίον γίγνονται τοῦ τῶν Ὑρκανίων στρατεύματος .
And as they were proceeding in light marching order with all dispatch, they naturally covered a great distance, and in the morning twilight they drew near to the army of the Hyrcanians.


4.2.16
1845
ὡς δ’ ἔγνωσαν οἱ ἄγγελοι , καὶ τῷ Κύρῳ λέγουσιν ὅτι οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ σφέτεροι ·
And when the messengers recognized the fact, they reported to Cyrus that these were their own people;


4.2.16
1846
τῷ τε γὰρ ὑστάτους εἶναι γιγνώσκειν ἔφασαν καὶ τῷ πλήθει τῶν πυρῶν ·
for they said that they recognized them both by the fact that they were in the rear and by the number of their fires.


4.2.17
1847
ἐκ τούτου πέμπει τὸν ἕτερον αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτούς , προστάξας λέγειν , εἰ φίλοι εἰσίν , ὡς τάχιστα ὑπαντᾶν τὰς δεξιὰς ἀνατείναντας ·
Upon hearing this report he sent one of the two messengers to them with orders to say that if they were friends, they should come to meet him with their right hands raised.


4.2.17
1848
συμπέμπει δέ τινα καὶ τῶν σὺν ἑαυτῷ καὶ λέγειν ἐκέλευσε τοῖς Ὑρκανίοις ὅτι ὡς ἂν ὁρῶσιν αὐτοὺς προσφερομένους , οὕτω καὶ αὐτοὶ ποιήσουσιν .
And he sent along also one of his own men and ordered him to tell the Hyrcanians that he and his army would govern their conduct according to the way in which they should see the Hyrcanians behave.


4.2.17
1849
οὕτω δὴ ὁ μὲν μένει τῶν ἀγγέλων παρὰ τῷ Κύρῳ , ὁ δὲ προσελαύνει πρὸς τοὺς Ὑρκανίους .
And thus it came to pass that one of the messengers remained with Cyrus, while the other rode away to the Hyrcanians.


4.2.18
1850
ἐν ᾧ δ’ ἐσκόπει τοὺς Ὑρκανίους ὁ Κῦρος ὅ τι ποιήσουσιν , ἐπέστησε τὸ στράτευμα ·
While Cyrus was watching to see what the Hyrcanians were going to do, he halted his army.


4.2.18
1851
παρελαύνουσι δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ τῶν Μήδων προεστηκότες καὶ ὁ Τιγράνης καὶ ἐπερωτῶσι τί δεῖ ποιεῖν .
Tigranes and the officers of the Medes rode up to him and asked what they should do.


4.2.18
1852
ὁ δὲ λέγει αὐτοῖς ὅτι τοῦτ’ ἔστι τὸ πλησίον Ὑρκανίων στράτευμα καὶ οἴχεται ὁ ἕτερος τῶν ἀγγέλων πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων τις σὺν αὐτῷ , ἐροῦντες , εἰ φίλοι εἰσίν , ὑπαντιάζειν τὰς δεξιὰς ἀνατείναντας πάντας .
And he said to them: “What you see there not far away is the Hyrcanian army; and one of their envoys has gone to them, and one of our men with him, to tell them all, if they are our friends, to come to meet us with their right hands upraised.”


4.2.18
1853
ἢν μὲν οὖν οὕτω ποιῶσι , δεξιοῦσθέ τε αὐτοὺς καθ’ ὃν ἂν ᾖ ἕκαστος καὶ ἅμα θαρρύνετε ·
“Now, if they do so, give to them the right hand of fellowship, each of you to the man opposite himself, and at the same time bid them welcome.”


4.2.18
1854
ἢν δὲ ὅπλα αἴρωνται ἢ φεύγειν ἐπιχειρῶσι , τούτων , ἔφη , εὐθὺς δεῖ πρώτων πειρᾶσθαι μηδένα λιπεῖν .
“But if they raise a weapon or attempt to run away, we must lose no time in trying not to leave a single one of these first alive.”


4.2.19
1855
ὁ μὲν τοιαῦτα παρήγγειλεν .
Such were his commands.


4.2.19
1856
οἱ δὲ Ὑρκάνιοι ἀκούσαντες τῶν ἀγγέλων ἥσθησάν τε καὶ ἀναπηδήσαντες ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους παρῆσαν τὰς δεξιάς , ὥσπερ εἴρητο , προτείνοντες ·
And the Hyrcanians were delighted when they heard the report of the envoys, and leaping upon their horses they came at once with right hands upraised, as directed.


4.2.19
1857
οἱ δὲ Μῆδοι καὶ Πέρσαι ἀντεδεξιοῦντό τε αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐθάρρυνον .
And the Medes and Persians gave the right hand of fellowship and bade them welcome.


4.2.20
1858
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ὁ Κῦρος λέγει ·
Men of Hyrcania, Cyrus said presently,


4.2.20
1859
ἡμεῖς μὲν δή , ὦ Ὑρκάνιοι , ἤδη ὑμῖν πιστεύομεν ·
we trust you now, as you see;


4.2.20
1860
καὶ ὑμᾶς δὲ χρὴ πρὸς ἡμᾶς οὕτως ἔχειν .
and you also ought to feel the same way toward us.


4.2.20
1861
τοῦτο δ’ , ἔφη , πρῶτον ἡμῖν εἴπατε πόσον ἀπέχει ἐνθένδε ἔνθα αἱ ἀρχαί εἰσι τῶν πολεμίων καὶ τὸ ἁθρόον αὐτῶν .
But tell us first how far it is from here to the headquarters of the enemy and the main body of their army.


4.2.20
1862
οἱ δ’ ἀπεκρίναντο ὅτι ὀλίγῳ πλέον ἢ παρασάγγην .
“Not much more than a parasang,” they answered.


4.2.21
1863
ἐνταῦθα δὴ λέγει ὁ Κῦρος ·
Come on, then, Persians and Medes, Cyrus cried; and you Hyrcanians — for now I speak with you also as confederates and allies.


4.2.21
1864
ἄγετε δή , ἔφη , ὦ ἄνδρες Πέρσαι καὶ Μῆδοι καὶ ὑμεῖς ὦ Ὑρκάνιοι , ἤδη γὰρ καὶ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὡς πρὸς συμμάχους καὶ κοινωνοὺς διαλέγομαι , εὖ χρὴ εἰδέναι νῦν ὅτι ἐν τοιούτῳ ἐσμὲν ἔνθα δὴ μαλακισάμενοι μὲν πάντων ἂν τῶν χαλεπωτάτων τύχοιμεν ·
You must know that we are in a position where we shall meet with nothing but disaster if we betray a lack of courage; for the enemy know what we have come for.


4.2.21
1865
ἴσασι γὰρ οἱ πολέμιοι ἐφ’ ἃ ἥκομεν ·
But if we go into the attack upon the enemy with might and main and with stout hearts,


4.2.21
1866
ἢν δὲ τὸ καρτερὸν ἐμβαλόμενοι ἴωμεν ῥώμῃ καὶ θυμῷ ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους , αὐτίκα μάλ’ ὄψεσθε ὥσπερ δούλων ἀποδιδρασκόντων ηὑρημένων τοὺς μὲν ἱκετεύοντας αὐτῶν , τοὺς δὲ φεύγοντας , τοὺς δ’ οὐδὲ ταῦτα φρονεῖν δυναμένους .
you will see right soon that, just like a lot of slaves caught in an attempt to run away, some of them will beg for mercy, others will try to escape, others still will not even have presence of mind to do either.


4.2.21
1867
ἡττημένοι τε γὰρ ὄψονται ἡμᾶς καὶ οὔτε οἰόμενοι ἥξειν οὔτε συντεταγμένοι οὔτε μάχεσθαι παρεσκευασμένοι κατειλημμένοι ἔσονται .
For they will see us before they have recovered from their first defeat, and they will find themselves caught neither thinking of our coming, nor drawn up in line, nor prepared to fight.


4.2.22
1868
εἰ οὖν ἡδέως βουλόμεθα καὶ δειπνῆσαι καὶ νυκτερεῦσαι καὶ βιοτεύειν τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε , μὴ δῶμεν τούτοις σχολὴν μήτε βουλεύσασθαι μήτε παρασκευάσασθαι ἀγαθὸν αὑτοῖς μηδέν , μηδὲ γνῶναι πάμπαν ὅτι ἄνθρωποί ἐσμεν , ἀλλὰ γέρρα καὶ κοπίδας καὶ σαγάρεις ἅπαντα καὶ πληγὰς ἥκειν νομιζόντων .
If, therefore, we wish from this time forth to eat well, to sleep soundly, and to live comfortably, let us not give them time either to take counsel or to provide any defence for themselves, or even to recognize at all that we are human beings; but let them think that nothing but shields, swords, bills, and blows have descended upon them.


4.2.23
1869
καὶ ὑμεῖς μέν , ἔφη , ὦ Ὑρκάνιοι , ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς προπετάσαντες ἡμῶν πορεύεσθε ἔμπροσθεν , ὅπως τῶν ὑμετέρων ὅπλων ὁρωμένων λανθάνωμεν ὅτι πλεῖστον χρόνον .
And you, Hyrcanians, said he, spread yourselves out in the van and march before us, in order that only your arms may be seen and that our presence here may be concealed as long as possible.


4.2.23
1870
ἐπειδὰν δ’ ἐγὼ πρὸς τῷ στρατεύματι γένωμαι τῶν πολεμίων , παρ’ ἐμοὶ μὲν καταλίπετε ἕκαστοι τάξιν ἱππέων , ὡς , ἄν τι δέῃ , χρῶμαι μένων παρὰ τὸ στρατόπεδον .
And when I come up with the enemy’s army, then leave with me, each of you, a division of cavalry for me to use while I remain near their camp.


4.2.24
1871
ὑμῶν δὲ οἱ μὲν ἄρχοντες καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἐν τάξει ἁθρόοι ἐλαύνετε , εἰ σωφρονεῖτε , ἵνα μήποτε ἁθρόῳ τινὶ ἐντυχόντες ἀποβιασθῆτε , τοὺς δὲ νεωτέρους ἀφίετε διώκειν ·
But you, officers and men of years, march together in close order, if you are wise, so that if you fall in with any compact body you may never be forced back; and leave the pursuit to the younger men,


4.2.24
1872
οὗτοι δὲ κατακαινόντων ·
and let them kill all they can;


4.2.24
1873
τοῦτο γὰρ ἀσφαλέστατον νῦν ὡς ἐλαχίστους τῶν πολεμίων λιπεῖν .
for this is the safest measure — to leave now as few of the enemy alive as possible.


4.2.25
1874
ἢν δὲ νικῶμεν , ἔφη , ὃ πολλοῖς δὴ κρατοῦσι τὴν τύχην ἀνέτρεψε , φυλάξασθαι δεῖ τὸ ἐφ’ ἁρπαγὴν τραπέσθαι ·
And if we win the battle, he continued, we must be on our guard against an error which has lost the day for many in the hour of victory — turning aside to plunder.


4.2.25
1875
ὡς ὁ τοῦτο ποιῶν οὐκέτ’ ἀνήρ ἐστιν , ἀλλὰ σκευοφόρος ·
For the man who does this is no longer a soldier but a camp-follower;


4.2.25
1876
καὶ ἔξεστι τῷ βουλομένῳ χρῆσθαι ἤδη τούτῳ ὡς ἀνδραπόδῳ .
and any one who will is free to treat him as a slave.


4.2.26
1877
ἐκεῖνο δὲ χρὴ γνῶναι ὅτι οὐδέν ἐστι κερδαλεώτερον τοῦ νικᾶν ·
You should realize this also, that nothing is more enriching than victory.


4.2.26
1878
ὁ γὰρ κρατῶν ἅμα πάντα συνήρπακε , καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ χρήματα καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν χώραν .
For the victor has swept together all the spoil at once, the men and the women, the wealth and all the lands.


4.2.26
1879
πρὸς ταῦτα τοῦτο μόνον ὁρᾶτε ὅπως τὴν νίκην διασῳζώμεθα ·
Therefore have an eye to this alone — that we may conserve our victory;


4.2.26
1880
ἐὰν γὰρ κρατηθῇ , καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ ἁρπάζων ἔχεται .
for even the plunderer himself is in the enemy’s power if he is conquered.


4.2.26
1881
καὶ τοῦτο ἅμα διώκοντες μέμνησθε , ἥκειν πάλιν ὡς ἐμὲ ἔτι φάους ὄντος ·
And remember even in the heat of pursuit to come back to me while it is yet daylight;


4.2.26
1882
ὡς σκότους γενομένου οὐδένα ἔτι προσδεξόμεθα .
for after nightfall we shall not admit another man.


4.2.27
1883
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν ἀπέπεμπεν εἰς τὰς τάξεις ἑκάστους καὶ ἐκέλευεν ἅμα πορευομένους τοῖς αὑτοῦ ἕκαστον δεκαδάρχοις τὰ αὐτὰ σημαίνειν ·
When he had said this he sent them away to their several companies with orders to issue, as they marched, the same directions each to his own corporals


4.2.27
1884
ἐν μετώπῳ γὰρ ἦσαν οἱ δεκάδαρχοι , ὥστε ἀκούειν ·
(for the corporals were in the front so as to hear);


4.2.27
1885
τοὺς δὲ δεκαδάρχους τῇ δεκάδι ἕκαστον κελεύειν παραγγέλλειν .
and they were to bid the corporals each one to announce it to his squad.


4.2.27
1886
ἐκ τούτου προηγοῦντο μὲν οἱ Ὑρκάνιοι , αὐτὸς δὲ τὸ μέσον ἔχων σὺν τοῖς Πέρσαις ἐπορεύετο ·
Then the Hyrcanians led the way while he himself with his Persians occupied the centre as they marched.


4.2.27
1887
τοὺς δὲ ἱππέας ἑκατέρωθεν , ὥσπερ εἰκός , παρέταξε .
The cavalry he arranged, as was natural, on either flank.


4.2.28
1888
τῶν δὲ πολεμίων , ἐπεὶ φῶς ἐγένετο , οἱ μὲν ἐθαύμαζον τὰ ὁρώμενα , οἱ δ’ ἐγίγνωσκον ἤδη , οἱ δ’ ἤγγελλον , οἱ δ’ ἐβόων , οἱ δ’ ἔλυον ἵππους , οἱ δὲ συνεσκευάζοντο , οἱ δ’ ἐρρίπτουν τὰ ὅπλα ἀπὸ τῶν ὑποζυγίων , οἱ δ’ ὡπλίζοντο , οἱ δ’ ἀνεπήδων ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους , οἱ δ’ ἐχαλίνουν , οἱ δὲ τὰς γυναῖκας ἀνεβίβαζον ἐπὶ τὰ ὀχήματα , οἱ δὲ τὰ πλείστου ἄξια ἐλάμβανον ὡς διασωσόμενοι , οἱ δὲ κατορύττοντες τὰ τοιαῦτα ἡλίσκοντο , οἱ δὲ πλεῖστοι ἐς φυγὴν ὥρμων ·
And when daylight came, some of the enemy wondered at what they saw, some realized at once what it meant, some began to spread the news, some to cry out, some proceeded to untie the horses, some to pack up, others to toss the armour off the pack-animals, still others to arm themselves, while some were leaping upon their horses, some bridling them, others helping the women into the wagons, and others were snatching up their most valuable possessions to save them; still others were caught in the act of burying theirs, while the most of them sought refuge in precipitate flight.


4.2.28
1889
οἴεσθαι δὲ δεῖ καὶ ἄλλα πολλά τε καὶ παντοδαπὰ ποιεῖν αὐτούς , πλὴν ἐμάχετο οὐδείς , ἀλλ’ ἀμαχητὶ ἀπώλλυντο .
We may imagine that they were doing many other things also — all sorts of other things — except that no one offered to resist, but they perished without striking a blow.


4.2.29
1890
Κροῖσος δὲ ὁ Λυδῶν βασιλεύς , ὡς θέρος ἦν , τάς τε γυναῖκας ἐν ταῖς ἁρμαμάξαις προαπεπέμψατο τῆς νυκτός , ὡς ἂν ῥᾷον πορεύοιντο κατὰ ψῦχος , καὶ αὐτὸς ἔχων τοὺς ἱππέας ἐπηκολούθει .
As it was summer, Croesus, the king of Lydia , had had his women sent on by night in carriages, that they might proceed more comfortably in the cool of the night, and he himself was following after with his cavalry.


4.2.30
1891
καὶ τὸν Φρύγα τὰ αὐτὰ ποιῆσαί φασι τὸν τῆς παρ’ Ἑλλήσποντον ἄρχοντα Φρυγίας .
And the Phrygian king, the ruler of Phrygia on the Hellespont, they say, did the same.


4.2.30
1892
ὡς δὲ παρῄσθοντο τῶν φευγόντων καὶ καταλαμβανόντων αὐτούς , πυθόμενοι τὸ γιγνόμενον ἔφευγον δὴ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀνὰ κράτος .
And when they saw the fugitives who were overtaking them, they enquired of them what was happening, and then they also took to flight as fast as they could go.


4.2.31
1893
τὸν δὲ τῶν Καππαδοκῶν βασιλέα καὶ τὸν τῶν Ἀραβίων ἔτι ἐγγὺς ὄντας καὶ ὑποστάντας ἀθωρακίστους κατακαίνουσιν οἱ Ὑρκάνιοι .
But the king of Cappadocia and the Arabian king, as they were still near by and stood their ground though unarmed, were cut down by the Hyrcanians.


4.2.31
1894
τὸ δὲ πλεῖστον ἦν τῶν ἀποθανόντων Ἀσσυρίων καὶ Ἀραβίων ·
But the majority of the slain were Assyrians and Arabians.


4.2.31
1895
ἐν γὰρ τῇ αὑτῶν ὄντες χώρᾳ ἀσυντονώτατα πρὸς τὴν πορείαν εἶχον .
For as these were in their own country, they were very leisurely about getting away.


4.2.32
1896
οἱ μὲν δὴ Μῆδοι καὶ Ὑρκάνιοι , οἷα δὴ εἰκὸς κρατοῦντας , τοιαῦτα ἐποίουν διώκοντες .
Now the Medes and Hyrcanians, as they pursued, committed such acts as men might be expected to commit in the hour of victory.


4.2.32
1897
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τοὺς παρ’ ἑαυτῷ ἱππέας καταλειφθέντας περιελαύνειν ἐκέλευε τὸ στρατόπεδον , καὶ εἴ τινας σὺν ὅπλοις ἴδοιεν ἐξιόντας , κατακαίνειν ·
But Cyrus ordered the horsemen who had been left with him to ride around the camp and to kill any that they saw coming out under arms;


4.2.32
1898
τοῖς δ’ ὑπομένουσιν ἐκήρυξεν , ὁπόσοι τῶν πολεμίων στρατιωτῶν ἦσαν ἱππεῖς ἢ πελτασταὶ ἢ τοξόται , ἀποφέρειν τὰ ὅπλα συνδεδεμένα , τοὺς δὲ ἵππους ἐπὶ ταῖς σκηναῖς καταλείπειν ·
while to those who remained inside he issued a proclamation that as many of the enemy’s soldiers as were cavalrymen or targeteers or bowmen should bring out their weapons tied in bundles and deliver them up, but should leave their horses at their tents.


4.2.32
1899
ὅστις δὲ ταῦτα μὴ ποιήσοι , αὐτίκα τῆς κεφαλῆς στερήσεσθαι ·
Whoever failed to do so should soon lose his head.


4.2.32
1900
τὰς δὲ κοπίδας προχείρους ἔχοντες ἐν τάξει περιέστασαν .
Now Cyrus’s men stood in line around them, sabre in hand.


4.2.33
1901
οἱ μὲν δὴ τὰ ὅπλα ἔχοντες ἐρρίπτουν , ἀποφέροντες εἰς ἓν χωρίον ὅποι ἐκέλευε ·
Accordingly, those who had the weapons carried them to one place, where he directed, and threw them down,


4.2.33
1902
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν οἷς ἐπέταξεν ἔκαιον .
and men whom he had appointed for the purpose burned them.


4.2.34
1903
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐνενόησεν ὅτι ἦλθον μὲν οὔτε σῖτα οὔτε ποτὰ ἔχοντες , ἄνευ δὲ τούτων οὔτε στρατεύεσθαι δυνατὸν οὔτ’ ἄλλο ποιεῖν οὐδέν .
Now Cyrus recollected that they had come with neither food nor drink, and without these it was not possible to prosecute a campaign or to do anything else.


4.2.34
1904
σκοπῶν δ’ ὅπως ἂν κάλλιστα καὶ τάχιστα ταῦτα γένοιτο , ἐνθυμεῖται ὅτι ἀνάγκη πᾶσι τοῖς στρατευομένοις εἶναί τινα ὅτῳ καὶ σκηνῆς μελήσει καὶ ὅπως τὰ ἐπιτήδεια παρεσκευασμένα τοῖς στρατιώταις εἰσιοῦσιν ἔσται .
And as he was considering how to procure the best possible supplies with the greatest possible dispatch, it occurred to him that all those who take the field must have some one to take care of the tent and to have food prepared for the soldiers when they came in.


4.2.35
1905
καὶ τοίνυν ἔγνω ὅτι τούτους εἰκὸς μάλιστα πάντων ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ νῦν κατειλῆφθαι ἦν διὰ τὸ ἀμφὶ συσκευασίαν ἔχειν ·
So he concluded that of all people these were the ones most likely to have been caught in the camp, because they would have been busy packing up.


4.2.35
1906
ἐκήρυξε δὴ παρεῖναι τοὺς ἐπιτρόπους πάντας ·
Accordingly, he issued a proclamation for all the commissaries to come to him;


4.2.35
1907
εἰ δέ που μὴ εἴη ἐπίτροπος , τὸν πρεσβύτατον ἀπὸ σκηνῆς ·
but if a commissary officer should be lacking anywhere, the oldest man from that tent should come.


4.2.35
1908
τῷ δὲ ἀπειθοῦντι πάντα τὰ χαλεπὰ ἀνεῖπεν .
And to any one who should dare to disobey he threatened direst punishment.


4.2.35
1909
οἱ δὲ ὁρῶντες καὶ τοὺς δεσπότας πειθομένους ταχὺ ἐπείθοντο .
But when they saw their masters obeying, they also obeyed at once.


4.2.36
1910
ἐπεὶ δὲ παρεγένοντο , πρῶτον μὲν ἐκέλευε καθίζεσθαι αὐτῶν ὅσοις ἐστὶ πλέον ἢ δυοῖν μηνοῖν ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια .
And when they had come, he first ordered those of them to sit down who had more than two months’ supply of provisions in their tents.


4.2.36
1911
ἐπεὶ δὲ τούτους εἶδεν , αὖθις ἐκέλευσεν ὅσοις μηνὸς ἦν ·
And when he had noted them, he gave the same order to those who had one month’s supply.


4.2.36
1912
ἐν τούτῳ σχεδὸν πάντες ἐκαθίζοντο .
Hereupon nearly all sat down.


4.2.37
1913
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα ἔμαθεν , εἶπεν ὧδε αὐτοῖς ·
And when he had this information he addressed them as follows:


4.2.37
1914
ἄγετέ νυν , ἔφη , ὦ ἄνδρες , οἵ τινες ὑμῶν τὰ μὲν κακὰ μισεῖτε , μαλακοῦ δέ τινος παρ’ ἡμῶν βούλοισθ’ ἂν τυγχάνειν , ἐπιμελήθητε προθύμως ὅπως διπλάσια ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ ἑκάστῃ σῖτα καὶ ποτὰ παρεσκευασμένα ᾖ ἢ τοῖς δεσπόταις καὶ τοῖς οἰκέταις καθ’ ἡμέραν ἐποιεῖτε ·
"Now then, my men," said he, "if any of you have a dislike for trouble and wish that you might receive kind treatment at our hands, be sure to see to it that there be twice as much food and drink prepared in each tent as you used to get ready every day for your masters and their servants;"


4.2.37
1915
καὶ τ- ἄλλα δὲ πάντα ὁπόσα καλὴν δαῖτα παρέξει ἕτοιμα ποιεῖτε , ὡς αὐτίκα μάλα παρέσονται ὁπότεροι ἂν κρατῶσι , καὶ ἀξιώσουσιν ἔκπλεω ἔχειν πάντα τὰ ἐπιτήδεια .
"and get everything else ready that belongs to a good meal; for whichever side is victorious, they will very soon be here and they will expect to find plenty of every sort of provisions."


4.2.37
1916
εὖ οὖν ἴστε ὅτι συμφέροι ἂν ὑμῖν ἀμέμπτως δέχεσθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας .
"Let me assure you, then, that it would be to your advantage to entertain those men handsomely."


4.2.38
1917
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἀκούσαντες πολλῇ σπουδῇ τὰ παρηγγελμένα ἔπραττον ·
When they heard this, they proceeded with great alacrity to carry out his directions,


4.2.38
1918
ὁ δὲ συγκαλέσας τοὺς ταξιάρχους ἔλεξε τοιάδε ·
while he called together his captains and spoke as follows:


4.2.38
1919
ἄνδρες φίλοι , γιγνώσκομεν ὅτι νῦν ἔξεστιν ἡμῖν προτέροις τῶν ἀπόντων συμμάχων ἀρίστου τυχεῖν καὶ τοῖς μάλιστα ἐσπουδασμένοις σίτοις καὶ ποτοῖς χρῆσθαι ·
"I realize, friends, that it is possible for us now to take luncheon first, while our comrades are away, and to enjoy the choicest food and drink."


4.2.38
1920
ἀλλ’ οὔ μοι δοκεῖ τοῦτ’ ἂν τὸ ἄριστον πλέον ὠφελῆσαι ἡμᾶς ἢ τὸ τῶν συμμάχων ἐπιμελεῖς φανῆναι , οὐδ’ ἂν αὕτη ἡ εὐωχία ἰσχυροτέρους τοσοῦτον ποιῆσαι ὅσον εἰ δυναίμεθα τοὺς συμμάχους προθύμους ποιεῖσθαι .
"But I do not think that it would be of more advantage to us to eat this luncheon than it would to show ourselves thoughtful for our comrades; neither do I think that this feasting would add as much to our strength as we should gain if we could make our allies devoted to us."


4.2.39
1921
εἰ δὲ τῶν νυνὶ διωκόντων καὶ κατακαινόντων τοὺς ἡμετέρους πολεμίους καὶ μαχομένων , εἴ τις ἐναντιοῦται , τούτων δόξομεν οὕτως ἀμελεῖν ὥστε καὶ πρὶν εἰδέναι πῶς πράττουσιν ἠριστηκότες φαίνεσθαι , ὅπως μὴ αἰσχροὶ μὲν φανούμεθα , ἀσθενεῖς δ’ ἐσόμεθα συμμάχων ἀποροῦντες .
"But if we show ourselves to be so neglectful of them that we are found to have broken our fast even before we know how they are faring, while they are pursuing and slaying our enemies and fighting any one that opposes them,"


4.2.39
1922
τὸ δὲ τῶν κινδυνευόντων καὶ πονούντων ἐπιμεληθῆναι ὅπως εἰσιόντες τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἕξουσιν , αὕτη ἂν ἡμᾶς ἡ θοίνη πλείω εὐφράνειεν , ὡς ἐγώ φημι , ἢ τὸ παραχρῆμα τῇ γαστρὶ χαρίσασθαι .
"let us beware lest we be disgraced in their eyes and lest we find ourselves crippled by the loss of our allies. But if, on the other hand, we take care that those who are bearing the danger and the toil shall have what they need when they come back, a banquet of this sort would, in my opinion, give us more pleasure than any immediate gratification of our appetites."


4.2.40
1923
ἐννοήσατε δ’ , ἔφη , ὡς εἰ μηδ’ ἐκείνους αἰσχυντέον ἦν , οὐδ’ ὣς ἡμῖν νῦν προσῆκεν οὔτε πλησμονῆς πω οὔτε μέθης ·
"And remember," said he, "that even if we were under no obligation to show them every consideration, even so it is not proper for us as yet to sate ourselves with food or drink;"


4.2.40
1924
οὐ γάρ πω διαπέπρακται ἡμῖν ἃ βουλόμεθα , ἀλλ’ αὐτὰ πάντα νῦν ἀκμάζει ἐπιμελείας δεόμενα .
"for not yet have we accomplished what we wish, but, on the contrary, everything is now at a crisis and requires care."


4.2.40
1925
ἔχομεν γὰρ ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ πολεμίους πολλαπλασίους ἡμῶν αὐτῶν , καὶ τούτους λελυμένους ·
"For we have enemies in camp many times our own number, and that, too, under no confinement."


4.2.40
1926
οὓς καὶ φυλάττεσθαι ἔτι προσήκει καὶ φυλάττειν , ὅπως ὦσι καὶ οἱ ποιήσοντες ἡμῖν τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ·
"We not only must keep watch against them but we must keep watch over them, so that we may have people to look after our provisions."


4.2.40
1927
ἔτι δ’ οἱ ἱππεῖς ἡμῖν ἄπεισι , φροντίδα παρέχοντες ποῦ εἰσι ·
"Besides, our cavalry are gone, making us anxious to know where they are,


4.2.40
1928
κἂν ἔλθωσιν , εἰ παραμενοῦσιν .
and whether they will stay with us if they do come back."


4.2.41
1929
ὥστ’ , ὦ ἄνδρες , νῦν μοι δοκεῖ τοιοῦτον σῖτον ἡμᾶς προσφέρεσθαι δεῖν καὶ τοιοῦτον ποτὸν ὁποῖον ἄν τις οἴεται μάλιστα σύμφορον εἶναι πρὸς τὸ μήτε ὕπνου μήτε ἀφροσύνης ἐμπίμπλασθαι .
And so, my men,  said he,  it seems to me that we should take only such meat and such drink as one would suppose to be least likely to overcome us with sleep and foolishness.


4.2.42
1930
ἔτι δὲ καὶ χρήματα πολλά ἐστιν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ , ὧν οὐκ ἀγνοῶ ὅτι δυνατὸν ἡμῖν κοινῶν ὄντων τοῖς συγκατειληφόσι νοσφίσασθαι ὁπόσα ἂν βουλώμεθα ·
"Besides, there is also a vast amount of treasure in the camp, and I am not ignorant of the fact that it is possible for us to appropriate to ourselves as much of it as we please, though it belongs just as much to those who helped us to get it."


4.2.42
1931
ἀλλ’ οὔ μοι δοκεῖ τὸ λαβεῖν κερδαλεώτερον εἶναι τοῦ δικαίους φαινομένους ἐκείνοις τούτῳ πρίασθαι ἔτι μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς ἢ νῦν ἀσπάζεσθαι ἡμᾶς .
"But I do not think it would bring us greater gain to take it than it would to show that we mean to be fair and square, and by such dealing to secure greater affection from them than we have already."


4.2.43
1932
δοκεῖ δέ μοι , ἔφη , καὶ τὸ νεῖμαι τὰ χρήματα , ἐπειδὰν ἔλθωσι , Μήδοις καὶ Ὑρκανίοις καὶ Τιγράνῃ ἐπιτρέψαι ·
"And so it seems best to me to entrust the division of the treasure to the Medes and Hyrcanians and Tigranes when they come;"


4.2.43
1933
καὶ ἤν τι μεῖον ἡμῖν δάσωνται , κέρδος ἡγεῖσθαι ·
"and if they apportion to us the smaller share, I think we should account it our gain;"


4.2.43
1934
διὰ γὰρ τὰ κέρδη ἥδιον ἡμῖν παραμενοῦσι .
"for because of what they gain, they will be the more glad to stay with us."


4.2.44
1935
τὸ μὲν γὰρ νῦν πλεονεκτῆσαι ὀλιγοχρόνιον ἂν τὸν πλοῦτον ἡμῖν παράσχοι ·
"For to secure a present advantage would give us but short-lived riches."


4.2.44
1936
τὸ δὲ ταῦτα προεμένους ἐκεῖνα κτήσασθαι ὅθεν ὁ πλοῦτος φύεται , τοῦτο , ὡς ἐγὼ δοκῶ , ἀεναώτερον ἡμῖν δύναιτ’ ἂν τὸν ὄλβον καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἡμετέροις παρέχειν .
"But to sacrifice this and obtain the source from which real wealth flows, that, as I see it, could put us and all of ours in possession of a perennial fountain of wealth."


4.2.45
1937
οἶμαι δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ οἴκοι ἡμᾶς τούτου ἕνεκα ἀσκεῖν καὶ γαστρὸς κρείττους εἶναι καὶ κερδέων ἀκαίρων , ἵν’ , εἴ ποτε δέοι , δυναίμεθα αὐτοῖς συμφόρως χρῆσθαι ·
"And if I am not mistaken, we used to train ourselves at home, too, to control our appetites and to abstain from unseasonable gain with this in view, that, if occasion should ever demand it, we might be able to employ our powers of self-control to our advantage."


4.2.45
1938
ποῦ δ’ ἂν ἐν μείζοσι τῶν νῦν παρόντων ἐπιδειξαίμεθ’ ἂν τὴν παιδείαν ἐγὼ μὲν οὐχ ὁρῶ .
"And I fail to see where we could give proof of our training on a more important occasion than the present."


4.2.45
1939
ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπε .
Thus he spoke.


4.2.46
1940
συνεῖπε δ’ αὐτῷ Ὑστάσπας ἀνὴρ Πέρσης τῶν ὁμοτίμων ὧδε ·
And Hystaspas, one of the Persian peers, supported him in the following speech:


4.2.46
1941
δεινὸν γάρ τ- ἂν εἴη , ὦ Κῦρε , εἰ ἐν θήρᾳ μὲν πολλάκις ἄσιτοι καρτεροῦμεν , ὅπως θηρίον τι ὑποχείριον ποιησώμεθα καὶ μάλα μικροῦ ἴσως ἄξιον ·
"Why, yes, Cyrus; on the chase we often hold out without a thing to eat, in order to get our hands on some beast, perhaps one worth very little;"


4.2.46
1942
ὄλβον δὲ ὅλον πειρώμενοι θηρᾶν εἰ ἐμποδών τι ποιησαίμεθα γενέσθαι ἡμῖν ἃ τῶν μὲν κακῶν ἀνθρώπων ἄρχει , τοῖς δ’ ἀγαθοῖς πείθεται , οὐκ ἂν πρέποντα ἡμῖν δοκοῦμεν ποιεῖν .
"and it would be strange indeed now, when the quarry we are trying to secure is a world of wealth, if we should for a moment allow those passions to stand in our way which are bad men’s masters but good men’s servants. I think, if we did so, we should be doing what does not befit us."


4.2.47
1943
ὁ μὲν οὖν Ὑστάσπας οὕτως εἶπεν ·
Such was Hystaspas’s speech,


4.2.47
1944
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι πάντες ταῦτα συνῄνουν .
and all the rest agreed with it.


4.2.47
1945
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Then Cyrus said:


4.2.47
1946
ἄγε δή , ἔφη , ἐπειδὴ ὁμονοοῦμεν ταῦτα , πέμψατε ἀπὸ λόχου ἕκαστος πέντε ἄνδρας τῶν σπουδαιοτάτων ·
"Come then, since we are of one mind on this point, send each of you five of the most reliable men from his platoon."


4.2.47
1947
οὗτοι δὲ περιιόντες , οὓς μὲν ἂν ὁρῶσι πορσύνοντας τὰ ἐπιτήδεια , ἐπαινούντων ·
"Let them go about and praise all those whom they see preparing provisions;"


4.2.47
1948
οὓς δ’ ἂν ἀμελοῦντας , κολαζόντων ἀφειδέστερον ἢ ὡς δεσπόται .
"and let them punish more unsparingly than if they were their masters those whom they see neglectful."


4.2.47
1949
οὗτοι μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἐποίουν .
Accordingly, they set about doing so.


4.3.1
1950
τῶν δὲ Μήδων τινὲς ἤδη , οἱ μὲν ἁμάξας προωρμημένας καταλαβόντες καὶ ἀποστρέψαντες προσήλαυνον μεστὰς ὧν δεῖται στρατιά , οἱ δὲ καὶ ἁρμαμάξας γυναικῶν τῶν βελτίστων τῶν μὲν γνησίων , τῶν δὲ καὶ παλλακίδων διὰ τὸ κάλλος συμπεριαγομένων , ταύτας εἰληφότες προσῆγον .
Now a part of the Medes were already bringing in the wagons which had been hurried forward and which they had overtaken and turned back packed full of what an army needs; others were bringing in the carriages that conveyed the most high-born women, not only wedded wives but also concubines, who on account of their beauty had been brought along; these also they captured and brought in.


4.3.2
1951
πάντες γὰρ ἔτι καὶ νῦν οἱ κατὰ τὴν Ἀσίαν στρατευόμενοι ἔχοντες τὰ πλείστου ἄξια στρατεύονται , λέγοντες ὅτι μᾶλλον μάχοιντ’ ἂν εἰ τὰ φίλτατα παρείη ·
For even unto this day all who go to war in Asia take with them to the field what they prize most highly; for they say that they would do battle the more valiantly, if all that they hold dearest were there;


4.3.2
1952
τούτοις γάρ φασιν ἀνάγκην εἶναι προθύμως ἀλέξειν .
for these, they say, they must do their best to protect.


4.3.2
1953
ἴσως μὲν οὖν οὕτως ἔχει , ἴσως δὲ καὶ ποιοῦσιν αὐτὰ τῇ ἡδονῇ χαριζόμενοι .
This may, perhaps, be true; but perhaps also they follow this custom for their own sensual gratification.


4.3.3
1954
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος θεωρῶν τὰ τῶν Μήδων ἔργα καὶ Ὑρκανίων ὥσπερ κατεμέμφετο καὶ αὑτὸν καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ , εἰ οἱ ἄλλοι τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον ἀκμάζειν τε μᾶλλον ἑαυτῶν ἐδόκουν καὶ προσκτᾶσθαί τι , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐν ἀργοτέρᾳ χώρᾳ ὑπομένειν .
When Cyrus saw what the Medes and Hyrcanians were doing, he poured reproach, as it were, upon himself and his men, because during this time the others seemed to be surpassing them in strenuous activity and gaining something by it, too, while he and his men remained in a position where there was little or nothing to do.


4.3.3
1955
καὶ γὰρ δὴ οἱ ἀπάγοντες καὶ ἀποδεικνύντες Κύρῳ ἃ ἦγον πάλιν ἀπήλαυνον , μεταδιώκοντες τοὺς ἄλλους ·
And it did seem so; for when the horsemen brought in and showed to Cyrus what they brought, they rode away again in pursuit of the others;


4.3.3
1956
ταῦτα γὰρ σφίσιν ἔφασαν προστετάχθαι ποιεῖν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχόντων .
for, they said, they had been instructed by their officers so to do.


4.3.3
1957
δακνόμενος δὴ ὁ Κῦρος ἐπὶ τούτοις ταῦτα μὲν ὅμως κατεχώριζε ·
Though Cyrus was naturally nettled at this, still he assigned a place to the spoil.


4.3.3
1958
συνεκάλει δὲ πάλιν τοὺς ταξιάρχους , καὶ στὰς ὅπου ἔμελλον πάντες ἀκούσεσθαι τὰ βουλευόμενα λέγει τάδε .
And again he called his captains together and standing where they would all be sure to hear his words of counsel, he spoke as follows:


4.3.4
1959
ὅτι μέν , ὦ ἄνδρες φίλοι , εἰ κατάσχοιμεν τὰ νῦν προφαινόμενα , μεγάλα μὲν ἂν ἅπασι Πέρσαις ἀγαθὰ γένοιτο , μέγιστα δ’ ἂν εἰκότως ἡμῖν δι’ ὧν πράττεται , πάντες οἶμαι γιγνώσκομεν ·
"Friends, we all appreciate, I am sure, that if we could but make our own the good fortune that is now dawning upon us,"


4.3.4
1960
ὅπως δ’ ἂν αὐτῶν ἡμεῖς κύριοι γιγνοίμεθα , μὴ αὐτάρκεις ὄντες κτήσασθαι αὐτά , εἰ μὴ ἔσται οἰκεῖον ἱππικὸν Πέρσαις τοῦτο ἐγὼ οὐκέτι ὁρῶ .
"great blessings would come to all the Persians and above all, as is reasonable, to us by whom they are secured."


4.3.5
1961
ἐννοεῖτε γὰρ δή , ἔφη ·
"But I fail to see how we are to establish a valid claim to the spoil if we cannot gain it by our own strength; and this we cannot do, unless the Persians have cavalry of their own."


4.3.5
1962
ἔχομεν ἡμεῖς οἱ Πέρσαι ὅπλα οἷς δοκοῦμεν ἂν τρέπεσθαι τοὺς πολεμίους ὁμόσε ἰόντες ·
"Just think of it," he went on; "we Persians have arms with which, it seems, we go into close quarters and put the enemy to flight;"


4.3.5
1963
καὶ δὴ τρεπόμενοι ποίους ἢ ἱππέας ἢ τοξότας ἢ πελταστὰς ἄνευ ἵππων ὄντες δυναίμεθ’ ἂν φεύγοντας ἢ λαβεῖν ἢ κατακανεῖν ;
"and then when we have routed them, how could we without horses capture or kill horsemen or bowmen or targeteers in their flight?"


4.3.5
1964
τίνες δ’ ἂν φοβοῖντο ἡμᾶς προσιόντες κακοῦν ἢ τοξόται ἢ ἀκοντισταὶ ἢ ἱππεῖς , εὖ εἰδότες ὅτι οὐδεὶς αὐτοῖς κίνδυνος ὑφ’ ἡμῶν κακόν τι παθεῖν μᾶλλον ἢ ὑπὸ τῶν πεφυκότων δένδρων ;
"And what bowmen or spearmen or horsemen would be afraid to come up and inflict loss upon us, when they are perfectly sure that they are in no more danger of being harmed by us than by the trees growing yonder?"


4.3.6
1965
εἰ δ’ οὕτω ταῦτ’ ἔχει , οὐκ εὔδηλον ὅτι οἱ νῦν παρόντες ἡμῖν ἱππεῖς νομίζουσι πάντα τὰ ὑποχείρια γιγνόμενα ἑαυτῶν εἶναι οὐχ ἧττον ἢ ἡμέτερα , ἴσως δὲ νὴ Δία καὶ μᾶλλον ;
And if this is so, is it not evident that the horsemen who are now with us consider that everything that has fallen into our hands is theirs no less than ours, and perhaps, by Zeus, even more so?


4.3.7
1966
νῦν μὲν οὖν οὕτω ταῦτ’ ἔχει κατ’ ἀνάγκην .
"As things are now, therefore, this is necessarily the case."


4.3.7
1967
εἰ δ’ ἡμεῖς ἱππικὸν κτησαίμεθα μὴ χεῖρον τούτων , οὐ πᾶσιν ἡμῖν καταφανὲς ὅτι τούς τ’ ἂν πολεμίους δυναίμεθα καὶ ἄνευ τούτων ποιεῖν ὅσαπερ νῦν σὺν τούτοις , τούτους τε ἔχοιμεν ἂν τότε μετριώτερον πρὸς ἡμᾶς φρονοῦντας ;
"But suppose we acquired a body of cavalry not inferior to theirs, is it not patent to us all that we should be able even without them to do to the enemy what we are now doing with their aid, and that we should find them then less presumptuous toward us?"


4.3.7
1968
ὁπότε γὰρ παρεῖναι ἢ ἀπεῖναι βούλοιντο , ἧττον ἂν ἡμῖν μέλοι , εἰ αὐτοὶ ἄνευ τούτων ἀρκοῖμεν ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς .
"For whenever they chose to remain or to go away, we should care less, if we were sufficient unto ourselves without them."


4.3.8
1969
εἶεν ·
"Very well then.


4.3.8
1970
ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οἶμαι οὐδεὶς ἂν ἀντιγνωμονήσειε , μὴ οὐχὶ τὸ πᾶν διαφέρειν Περσῶν γενέσθαι οἰκεῖον ἱππικόν ·
No one, I think, would gain-say me in this statement, that it makes all the difference in the world whether the Persians have their own cavalry or not."


4.3.8
1971
ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνο ἴσως ἐννοεῖτε , πῶς ἂν τοῦτο γένοιτο .
"But perhaps you are wondering how this may be accomplished."


4.3.8
1972
ἆρ’ οὖν σκεψώμεθα , εἰ βουλοίμεθα καθιστάναι ἱππικόν , τί ἡμῖν ὑπάρχει καὶ τίνος ἐνδεῖ ;
"Well then, supposing that we wished to organize a division of cavalry, had we not better consider our resources and our deficiencies?"


4.3.9
1973
οὐκοῦν ἵπποι μὲν οὗτοι πολλοὶ ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ κατειλημμένοι καὶ χαλινοὶ οἷς πείθονται καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὅσα δεῖ ἵπποις ἔχουσι χρῆσθαι .
"Here, then, in camp are numbers of horses which we have taken and reins which they obey, and everything else that horses must have before you can use them."


4.3.9
1974
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ οἷς γε δεῖ ἄνδρα ἱππέα χρῆσθαι ἔχομεν , θώρακας μὲν ἐρύματα τῶν σωμάτων , παλτὰ δὲ οἷς καὶ μεθιέντες καὶ ἔχοντες χρῴμεθ’ ἄν .
"Yes, and more, all that a horseman must use we have — breastplates as defensive armour for the body and spears which we may use either to hurl or to thrust."


4.3.10
1975
τί δὴ τὸ λοιπόν ;
"What then remains?


4.3.10
1976
δῆλον ὅτι ἀνδρῶν δεῖ .
Obviously we must have men."


4.3.10
1977
οὐκοῦν τοῦτο μάλιστα ἔχομεν ·
"Now these above all other things we have;


4.3.10
1978
οὐδὲν γὰρ οὕτως ἡμέτερόν ἐστιν ὡς ἡμεῖς ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς .
for nothing is so fully ours as we ourselves are our own."


4.3.10
1979
ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις ἴσως ὅτι οὐκ ἐπιστάμεθα .
"But perhaps some one will say that we do not know how to ride."


4.3.10
1980
μὰ Δί’ οὐδὲ γὰρ τούτων τῶν ἐπισταμένων νῦν πρὶν μαθεῖν οὐδεὶς ἠπίστατο .
"No, by Zeus; and no one of these who now know how to ride did know before he learned."


4.3.10
1981
ἀλλ’ εἴποι ἄν τις ὅτι παῖδες ὄντες ἐμάνθανον .
"But, some one may say, they learned when they were boys."


4.3.11
1982
καὶ πότερα παῖδές εἰσι φρονιμώτεροι ὥστε μαθεῖν τὰ φραζόμενα καὶ δεικνύμενα ἢ ἄνδρες ;
"And are boys more clever in learning what is explained to them and what is shown them than are men?"


4.3.11
1983
πότεροι δὲ ἃ ἂν μάθωσιν ἱκανώτεροι τῷ σώματι ἐκπονεῖν , οἱ παῖδες ἢ οἱ ἄνδρες ;
"And which are better able with bodily strength to put into practice what they have learned, boys or men?"


4.3.12
1984
ἀλλὰ μὴν σχολή γε ἡμῖν μανθάνειν ὅση οὔτε παισὶν οὔτε ἄλλοις ἀνδράσιν ·
"Again, we have more time for learning than either boys or other men;


4.3.12
1985
οὔτε γὰρ τοξεύειν ἡμῖν μαθητέον ὥσπερ τοῖς παισί ·
for we have not, like boys, to learn to shoot,


4.3.12
1986
προεπιστάμεθα γὰρ τοῦτο ·
for we know this already;


4.3.12
1987
οὔτε μὴν ἀκοντίζειν ·
4.3.12.1987 not how to throw the spear,


4.3.12
1988
ἐπιστάμεθα γὰρ καὶ τοῦτο ·
for we understand that, too."


4.3.12
1989
ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ μὴν ὥσπερ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀνδράσι τοῖς μὲν γεωργίαι ἀσχολίαν παρέχουσι , τοῖς δὲ τέχναι , τοῖς δὲ ἄλλα οἰκεῖα ·
"No; nor yet again are we so situated as other men, some of whom are kept busy with their farming, some with their trades, and some with other domestic labours.


4.3.12
1990
ἡμῖν δὲ στρατεύεσθαι οὐ μόνον σχολὴ ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀνάγκη .
We, however, not only have time for military operations, but they are forced upon us."


4.3.13
1991
ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐχ ὥσπερ ἄλλα πολλὰ τῶν πολεμικῶν χαλεπὰ μέν , χρήσιμα δέ ·
"And this is not like many other branches of military discipline, useful but laborious;"


4.3.13
1992
ἱππικὴ δὲ οὐκ ἐν ὁδῷ μὲν ἡδίων ἢ αὐτοῖν τοῖν ποδοῖν πορεύεσθαι ;
"nay, when it comes to marching, is not riding more pleasant than tramping along on one’s own two feet?"


4.3.13
1993
ἐν δὲ σπουδῇ οὐχ ἡδὺ ταχὺ μὲν φίλῳ παραγενέσθαι , εἰ δέοι , ταχὺ δέ , εἴτε ἄνδρα εἴτε θῆρα δέοι διώκεσθαι , καταλαβεῖν ;
"And when speed is required, is it not delightful quickly to reach a friend’s side, if need be, and quickly to overtake a man or an animal, if occasion should require one to give chase?"


4.3.13
1994
ἐκεῖνο δὲ οὐχὶ εὐπετές , τὸ ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ ὅπλον φέρειν τὸν ἵππον τοῦτο συμφέρειν ;
"And is this not convenient, that the horse should help you to carry whatever accoutrement you must take along?"


4.3.13
1995
οὔκουν τ- αὐτό γ’ ἐστὶν ἔχειν τε καὶ φέρειν .
"Surely, to have and to carry are not quite the same thing."


4.3.14
1996
ὅ γε μὴν μάλιστ’ ἄν τις φοβηθείη , μὴ εἰ δεήσει ἐφ’ ἵππου κινδυνεύειν ἡμᾶς πρότερον πρὶν ἀκριβοῦν τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο , κ- ἔπειτα μήτε πεζοὶ ἔτι ὦμεν μήτε πω ἱππεῖς ἱκανοί , ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ τοῦτο ἀμήχανον ·
"What one might have most of all to fear, however, is that in case it is necessary for us to go into action on horseback before we have thoroughly mastered this task, we shall then be no longer infantrymen and not yet competent cavalrymen."


4.3.14
1997
ὅπου γὰρ ἂν βουλώμεθα , ἐξέσται ἡμῖν πεζοῖς εὐθὺς μάχεσθαι ·
"But not even this is an insurmountable difficulty; for whenever we wish, we may at once fight on foot;"


4.3.14
1998
οὐδὲν γὰρ τῶν πεζικῶν ἀπομαθησόμεθα ἱππεύειν μανθάνοντες .
"for in learning to ride we shall not be unlearning any of our infantry tactics."


4.3.15
1999
Κῦρος μὲν οὕτως εἶπε ·
Thus Cyrus spoke;


4.3.15
2000
Χρυσάντας δὲ συναγορεύων αὐτῷ ὧδε ἔλεξεν .
and Chrysantas seconded him in the following speech:


4.3.15
2001
ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ μέν , ἔφη , οὕτως ἐπιθυμῶ ἱππεύειν μαθεῖν ὡς νομίζω , ἢν ἱππεὺς γένωμαι , ἄνθρωπος πτηνὸς ἔσεσθαι .
"I, for one, am so eager to learn horsemanship, that I think that if I become a horseman I shall be a man on wings."


4.3.16
2002
νῦν μὲν γὰρ ἔγωγε ἀγαπῶ ἤν γ’ ἐξ ἴσου τῳ θεῖν ὁρμηθεὶς ἀνθρώπων μόνον τῇ κεφαλῇ πρόσχω , κἂν θηρίον παραθέον ἰδὼν δυνασθῶ διατεινάμενος φθάσαι ὥστε ἀκοντίσαι ἢ τοξεῦσαι πρὶν πάνυ πρόσω αὐτὸ γενέσθαι .
For as we are now, I, at least, am satisfied, when I have an even start in running a race with any man, if I can beat him only by a head;


4.3.16
2003
ἢν δ’ ἱππεὺς γένωμαι , δυνήσομαι μὲν ἄνδρα ἐξ ὄψεως μήκους καθαιρεῖν ·
and when I see an animal running along, I am satisfied if I can get a good aim quickly enough to shoot him or spear him before he gets very far away.


4.3.16
2004
δυνήσομαι δὲ θηρία διώκων τὰ μὲν ἐκ χειρὸς παίειν καταλαμβάνων , τὰ δὲ ἀκοντίζειν ὥσπερ ἑστηκότα ·
But if I become a horseman I shall be able to overtake a man though he is as far off as I can see him;


4.3.16
2005
καὶ γὰρ ἐὰν ἀμφότερα ταχέα ᾖ , ὅμως δὲ πλησίον γίγνηται ἀλλήλων , ὥσπερ τὰ ἑστηκότα ἐστίν .
and I shall be able to pursue animals and overtake them and either strike them down from close at hand or spear them as if they were standing still; and they seem so, for though both be moving rapidly, yet, if they are near to one another, they are as if standing still.


4.3.17
2006
ὧν δὲ δὴ μάλιστα δοκῶ ζῴων , ἔφη , ἐζηλωκέναι ἱπποκενταύρους , εἰ ἐγένοντο ὥστε προβουλεύεσθαι μὲν ἀνθρώπου φρονήσει , ταῖς δὲ χερσὶ τὸ δέον παλαμᾶσθαι , ἵππου δὲ τάχος ἔχειν καὶ ἰσχύν , ὥστε τὸ μὲν φεῦγον αἱρεῖν , τὸ δ’ ὑπομένον ἀνατρέπειν , οὔκουν πάντα κ- ἐγὼ ταῦτα ἱππεὺς γενόμενος συγκομίζομαι πρὸς ἐμαυτόν ;
Now the creature that I have envied most is, I think, the Centaur (if any such being ever existed), able to reason with a man’s intelligence and to manufacture with his hands what he needed, while he possessed the fleetness and strength of a horse so as to overtake whatever ran before him and to knock down whatever stood in his way. Well, all his advantages I combine in myself by becoming a horseman.


4.3.18
2007
προνοεῖν μέν γε ἕξω πάντα τῇ ἀνθρωπίνῃ γνώμῃ , ταῖς δὲ χερσὶν ὁπλοφορήσω , διώξομαι δὲ τῷ ἵππῳ , τὸν δ’ ἐναντίον ἀνατρέψω τῇ τοῦ ἵππου ῥύμῃ , ἀλλ’ οὐ συμπεφυκὼς δεδήσομαι ὥσπερ οἱ ἱπποκένταυροι ·
At any rate, I shall be able to take forethought for everything with my human mind, I shall carry my weapons with my hands, I shall pursue with my horse and overthrow my opponent by the rush of my steed, but I shall not be bound fast to him in one growth, like the Centaurs.


4.3.19
2008
οὐκοῦν τοῦτό γε κρεῖττον ἢ συμπεφυκέναι .
Indeed, my state will be better than being grown together in one piece;


4.3.19
2009
τοὺς μὲν γὰρ ἱπποκενταύρους οἶμαι ἔγωγε πολλοῖς μὲν ἀπορεῖν τῶν ἀνθρώποις ηὑρημένων ἀγαθῶν ὅπως δεῖ χρῆσθαι , πολλῶν δὲ τῶν ἵπποις πεφυκότων ἡδέων πῶς αὐτῶν χρὴ ἀπολαύειν .
for, in my opinion at least, the Centaurs must have had difficulty in making use of many of the good things invented for man;


4.3.20
2010
ἐγὼ δὲ ἢν ἱππεύειν μάθω , ὅταν μὲν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἵππου γένωμαι , τὰ τοῦ ἱπποκενταύρου δήπου διαπράξομαι ·
and how could they have enjoyed many of the comforts natural to the horse?


4.3.20
2011
ὅταν δὲ καταβῶ , δειπνήσω καὶ ἀμφιέσομαι καὶ καθευδήσω ὥσπερ οἱ ἄλλοι ἄνθρωποι ·
But if I learn to ride, I shall, when I am on horseback, do everything as the Centaur does, of course;


4.3.20
2012
ὥστε τί ἄλλο ἢ διαιρετὸς ἱπποκένταυρος καὶ πάλιν σύνθετος γίγνομαι ;
but when I dismount, I shall dine and dress myself and sleep like other human beings;


4.3.21
2013
ἔτι δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ τοῖσδε πλεονεκτήσω τοῦ ἱπποκενταύρου ·
and so what else shall I be than a Centaur that can be taken apart and put together again?


4.3.21
2014
ὁ μὲν γὰρ δυοῖν ὀφθαλμοῖν ἑώρα τε καὶ δυοῖν ὤτοιν ἤκουεν ·
And then, he added, I shall have the advantage of the Centaur in this, too, that he used to see with but two eyes and hear with but two ears,


4.3.21
2015
ἐγὼ δὲ τέτταρσι μὲν ὀφθαλμοῖς τεκμαροῦμαι , τέτταρσι δὲ ὠσὶν αἰσθήσομαι ·
while I shall gather evidence with four eyes and learn through four ears;


4.3.21
2016
πολλὰ γάρ φασι καὶ ἵππον ἀνθρώπῳ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς προορῶντα δηλοῦν , πολλὰ δὲ τοῖς ὠσὶν προακούοντα σημαίνειν .
for they say that a horse actually sees many things with his eyes before his rider does and makes them known to him, and that he hears many things with his ears before his rider does and gives him intimation of them.


4.3.21
2017
ἐμὲ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη , γράφε τῶν ἱππεύειν ὑπερεπιθυμούντων .
Put me down, therefore, said he, as one of those who are more than eager to become cavalrymen.


4.3.21
2018
νὴ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφασαν οἱ ἄλλοι πάντες , καὶ ἡμᾶς γε .
Aye, by Zeus, said all the rest, and us too.


4.3.22
2019
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ὁ Κῦρος λέγει ·
How would it do, then, Cyrus asked, since we are all so very well agreed upon this matter,


4.3.22
2020
τί οὖν , ἔφη , ἐπεὶ σφόδρα ἡμῖν δοκεῖ ταῦτα , εἰ καὶ νόμον ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ποιησαίμεθα αἰσχρὸν εἶναι , οἷς ἂν ἵππους ἐγὼ πορίσω , ἤν τις φανῇ πεζῇ ἡμῶν πορευόμενος , ἤν τε πολλὴν ἤν τε ὀλίγην ὁδὸν δέῃ διελθεῖν ;
if we should make a rule for ourselves that it be considered improper for any one of us whom I provide with a horse to be seen going anywhere on foot,


4.3.22
2021
ἵνα καὶ παντάπασιν ἱπποκενταύρους ἡμᾶς οἴωνται οἱ ἄνθρωποι εἶναι .
whether the distance he has to go be long or short, so that people may think that we are really Centaurs?


4.3.23
2022
ὁ μὲν οὕτως ἐπήρετο , οἱ δὲ πάντες συνῄνεσαν ·
He put the question thus and they all voted aye.


4.3.23
2023
ὥστ’ ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐξ ἐκείνου χρῶνται Πέρσαι οὕτω , καὶ οὐδεὶς ἂν τῶν καλῶν κ- ἀγαθῶν ἑκὼν ὀφθείη Περσῶν οὐδαμῇ πεζὸς ἰών .
And so from that time even to this day, the Persians follow that practice, and no Persian gentleman would be seen going anywhere on foot, if he could help it.


4.3.23
2024
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἐν τούτοις τοῖς λόγοις ἦσαν .
Such were their discussions on this occasion.


4.4.1
2025
ἡνίκα δ’ ἦν ἔξω μέσου ἡμέρας , προσήλαυνον μὲν οἱ Μῆδοι ἱππεῖς καὶ Ὑρκάνιοι , ἵππους τε ἄγοντες αἰχμαλώτους καὶ ἄνδρας ·
And when it was past midday, the Median and Hyrcanian horsemen came in, bringing both horses and men that they had taken.


4.4.1
2026
ὅσοι γὰρ τὰ ὅπλα παρεδίδοσαν , οὐ κατέκαινον ·
For they had spared the lives of all who had surrendered their arms.


4.4.2
2027
ἐπεὶ δὲ προσήλασαν , πρῶτον μὲν αὐτῶν ἐπυνθάνετο ὁ Κῦρος εἰ σῶοι οἱ πάντες εἶεν αὐτῷ ·
And when they had ridden up, Cyrus asked them first whether his men were all safe.


4.4.2
2028
ἐπεὶ δὲ τοῦτ’ ἔφασαν , ἐκ τούτου ἠρώτα τί ἔπραξαν .
And when they answered this in the affirmative, he asked how they had fared.


4.4.2
2029
οἱ δὲ διηγοῦντο ἅ τ’ ἐποίησαν καὶ ὡς ἀνδρείως ἕκαστα .
And they narrated to him what they had accomplished and proudly told how gallantly they had behaved in every particular.


4.4.3
2030
.
[ellipsis in text]


4.4.3
2031
ἐμεγαληγόρουν .
they were speaking proudly.


4.4.3
2032
ὁ δὲ διήκουέ τε ἡδέως πάντων ἃ ἐβούλοντο λέγειν ·
And he listened with pleasure to all they wished to tell him,


4.4.3
2033
ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ ἐπῄνεσεν αὐτοὺς οὕτως ·
and then he praised them in these words:


4.4.3
2034
ἀλλὰ καὶ δῆλοί τοι , ἔφη , ἐστὲ ὅτι ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ ἐγένεσθε ·
It is quite evident that you have conducted yourselves as brave men;


4.4.3
2035
καὶ γὰρ μείζους φαίνεσθε καὶ καλλίους καὶ γοργότεροι ἢ πρόσθεν ἰδεῖν .
and any one can see it, for you appear taller and handsomer and more terrible to look upon than heretofore.


4.4.4
2036
ἐκ δὲ τούτου ἐπυνθάνετο ἤδη αὐτῶν καὶ ὁπόσην ὁδὸν διήλασαν καὶ εἰ οἰκοῖτο ἡ χώρα .
Then he enquired of them further how far they had ridden and whether the country was inhabited.


4.4.4
2037
οἱ δ’ ἔλεγον ὅτι καὶ πολλὴν διελάσειαν καὶ πᾶσα οἰκοῖτο καὶ μεστὴ εἴη καὶ οἰῶν καὶ αἰγῶν καὶ βοῶν καὶ ἵππων καὶ σίτου καὶ πάντων ἀγαθῶν .
And they replied, first, that they had ridden a long way, and second, that all the country was inhabited and that it was full of sheep and goats, cattle and horses, grain and all sorts of produce.


4.4.5
2038
δυοῖν ἄν , ἔφη , ἐπιμελητέον ἡμῖν εἴη , ὅπως τε κρείττους ἐσόμεθα τῶν ταῦτα ἐχόντων καὶ ὅπως αὐτοὶ μενοῦσιν ·
There are two things, said he, that it were well for us to look out for: that we make ourselves masters of those who own this property, and that they stay where they are.


4.4.5
2039
οἰκουμένη μὲν γὰρ χώρα πολλοῦ ἄξιον κτῆμα ·
For an inhabited country is a very valuable possession,


4.4.5
2040
ἐρήμη δ’ ἀνθρώπων οὖσα ἐρήμη καὶ τῶν ἀγαθῶν γίγνεται .
but a land destitute of people becomes likewise destitute of produce.


4.4.6
2041
τοὺς μὲν οὖν ἀμυνομένους , ἔφη , οἶδα ὅτι κατεκάνετε , ὀρθῶς ποιοῦντες ·
Those, therefore, who tried to keep you off, you slew, I know; and you did right.


4.4.6
2042
τοῦτο γὰρ μάλιστα σῴζει τὴν νίκην ·
For this is the best way to conserve the fruits of victory.


4.4.6
2043
τοὺς δὲ παραδιδόντας αἰχμαλώτους ἠγάγετε ·
But those who surrendered you have brought as prisoners of war.


4.4.6
2044
οὓς εἰ ἀφείημεν , τοῦτ’ αὖ σύμφορον ἄν , ὡς ἐγώ φημι , ποιήσαιμεν ·
Now, if we should let them go, we should, I think, do what would be in itself an advantage.


4.4.7
2045
πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ νῦν οὐκ ἂν φυλάττεσθαι οὐδὲ φυλάττειν ἡμᾶς τούτους δέοι , οὐδ’ αὖ σιτοποιεῖν τούτοις ·
For, in the first place, we should not have to keep watch against them nor should we have to keep watch over them, nor yet to furnish them with food;


4.4.7
2046
οὐ γὰρ λιμῷ γε δήπου κατακανοῦμεν αὐτούς ·
for, of course, we do not mean to let them starve to death;


4.4.7
2047
ἔπειτα δὲ τούτους ἀφέντες πλείοσιν αἰχμαλώτοις χρησόμεθα .
and in the second place, if we let them go, we shall have more prisoners of war than if we do not.


4.4.8
2048
ἢν γὰρ κρατῶμεν τῆς χώρας , πάντες ἡμῖν οἱ ἐν αὐτῇ οἰκοῦντες αἰχμάλωτοι ἔσονται ·
For, if we are masters of the country, all they that dwell therein will be our prisoners of war;


4.4.8
2049
μᾶλλον δὲ τούτους ζῶντας ἰδόντες καὶ ἀφεθέντας μενοῦσιν οἱ ἄλλοι καὶ πείθεσθαι αἱρήσονται μᾶλλον ἢ μάχεσθαι .
and the rest, when they see these alive and set at liberty, will stay in their places and choose to submit rather than to fight.


4.4.8
2050
ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν οὕτω γιγνώσκω ·
This, then, is my proposition;


4.4.8
2051
εἰ δ’ ἄλλο τις ὁρᾷ ἄμεινον , λεγέτω .
but if any one else sees a better plan, let him speak.


4.4.8
2052
οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες συνῄνουν ταῦτα ποιεῖν .
But when they heard his proposal they agreed to adopt it.


4.4.9
2053
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κῦρος καλέσας τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους λέγει τοιάδε ·
Accordingly, Cyrus  called the prisoners together and spoke as follows:


4.4.10
2054
ἄνδρες , ἔφη , νῦν τε ὅτι ἐπείθεσθε τὰς ψυχὰς περιεποιήσασθε , τοῦ τε λοιποῦ , ἢν οὕτω ποιῆτε , οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν καινὸν ἔσται ὑμῖν ἀλλ’ ἢ οὐχ ὁ αὐτὸς ἄρξει ὑμῶν ὅσπερ καὶ πρότερον ·
My men, said he, you have now saved your lives by your submission;


4.4.10
2055
οἰκήσετε δὲ τὰς αὐτὰς οἰκίας καὶ χώραν τὴν αὐτὴν ἐργάσεσθε καὶ γυναιξὶ ταῖς αὐταῖς συνοικήσετε καὶ παίδων τῶν ὑμετέρων ἄρξετε ὥσπερ νῦν ·
and in the future also, if you continue to be obedient, no change whatever shall come to you except that you shall not have the same ruler over you as before;


4.4.10
2056
ἡμῖν μέντοι οὐ μαχεῖσθε οὐδὲ ἄλλῳ οὐδενί ·
but you shall dwell in the same houses and work the same farms; you shall live with the same wives and have control of your children just as now.


4.4.11
2057
ἡνίκα δ’ ἄν τις ὑμᾶς ἀδικῇ , ἡμεῖς ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν μαχούμεθα .
But you shall not have to fight either us or any one else;


4.4.11
2058
ὅπως δὲ μηδ’ ἐπαγγέλλῃ μηδεὶς ὑμῖν στρατεύειν , τὰ ὅπλα πρὸς ἡμᾶς κομίσατε ·
but when any one injures you, we will fight for you; and that no one may even ask military service of you, bring your arms to us.


4.4.11
2059
καὶ τοῖς μὲν κομίζουσιν ἔσται εἰρήνη καὶ ἃ λέγομεν ἀδόλως ·
And those that bring them shall have peace, and what we promise shall be done without guile.


4.4.11
2060
ὁπόσοι δ’ ἂν τὰ πολεμικὰ μὴ ἀποφέρωσιν ὅπλα , ἐπὶ τούτους ἡμεῖς καὶ δὴ στρατευσόμεθα .
But as many as fail to deliver up their weapons of war, against these we ourselves shall take the field immediately.


4.4.12
2061
ἐὰν δέ τις ὑμῶν καὶ ἰὼν ὡς ἡμᾶς εὐνοϊκῶς καὶ πράττων τι καὶ διδάσκων φαίνηται , τοῦτον ἡμεῖς ὡς εὐεργέτην καὶ φίλον , οὐχ ὡς δοῦλον περιέψομεν .
But if any one of you comes to us in a friendly way and shows that he is dealing fairly with us and giving us information, we shall treat him as our benefactor and friend and not as a slave.


4.4.12
2062
ταῦτ’ οὖν , ἔφη , αὐτοί τε ἴστε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις διαγγέλλετε .
Accept these assurances for yourselves, and convey them to the rest also.


4.4.13
2063
ἢν δ’ ἄρα , ἔφη , ὑμῶν βουλομένων ταῦτα μὴ πείθωνταί τινες , ἐπὶ τούτους ἡμᾶς ἄγετε , ὅπως ὑμεῖς ἐκείνων , μὴ ἐκεῖνοι ὑμῶν ἄρχωσιν .
But if, said he while, you are willing to accept these terms of submission, some others are not, do you lead us against them that you may be their masters and not they yours.


4.4.13
2064
ὁ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ εἶπεν ·
Thus he spoke


4.4.13
2065
οἱ δὲ προσεκύνουν τε καὶ ὑπισχνοῦντο ταῦτα ποιήσειν .
and they did obeisance and promised to do what he directed.


4.5.1
2066
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐκεῖνοι ᾤχοντο , ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
When they were gone, Cyrus said:


4.5.1
2067
ὥρα δή , ὦ Μῆδοι καὶ Ἀρμένιοι , δειπνεῖν πᾶσιν ἡμῖν ·
Medes and Armenians, it is now high time for us all to go to dinner;


4.5.1
2068
παρεσκεύασται δὲ ὑμῖν τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ὡς ἡμεῖς βέλτιστα ἐδυνάμεθα .
and everything necessary has been prepared for you to the best of our ability.


4.5.1
2069
ἀλλ’ ἴτε καὶ ἡμῖν πέμπετε τοῦ πεποιημένου σίτου τὸν ἥμισυν ·
Go, then, and send to us half of the bread that has been baked —


4.5.1
2070
ἱκανὸς δὲ ἀμφοτέροις πεποίηται ·
enough has been made for all;


4.5.1
2071
ὄψον δὲ μὴ πέμπετε μηδὲ πιεῖν ·
but do not send us any meat nor anything to drink;


4.5.1
2072
ἱκανὰ γὰρ ἔχομεν παρ’ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς παρεσκευασμένα .
for enough has been provided for us at our own quarters.


4.5.2
2073
καὶ ὑμεῖς δέ , ὦ Ὑρκάνιοι , ἔφη , διάγετε αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰς σκηνάς , τοὺς μὲν ἄρχοντας ἐπὶ τὰς μεγίστας , γιγνώσκετε δέ , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους ὡς ἂν δοκῇ κάλλιστα ἔχειν ·
And you, Hyrcanians, he said to these, lead them to their several tents — the officers to the largest (you know which they are),


4.5.2
2074
καὶ αὐτοὶ δὲ δειπνεῖτε ὅπουπερ ἥδιστον ὑμῖν ·
and the rest as you think best. And you yourselves also may dine where it best pleases you.


4.5.2
2075
σῶαι μὲν γὰρ ὑμῖν καὶ ἀκέραιοι αἱ σκηναί ·
For your own tents also are safe and sound,


4.5.2
2076
παρεσκεύασται δὲ καὶ ὑμῖν ἐνθάδε ὥσπερ καὶ τούτοις .
and there also the same provision has been made as for these.


4.5.3
2077
καὶ τοῦτο δὲ ἴστε ἀμφότεροι ὅτι τὰ μὲν ἔξω ὑμῖν ἡμεῖς νυκτοφυλακήσομεν , τὰ δ’ ἐν ταῖς σκηναῖς αὐτοὶ ὁρᾶτε καὶ τὰ ὅπλα εὖ τίθεσθε ·
And all of you may be assured of this, that we shall keep the night-watches for you outside the camp,


4.5.3
2078
οἱ γὰρ ἐν ταῖς σκηναῖς οὔπω φίλοι ἡμῖν .
but do you look out for what may happen in the tents and have your arms stacked conveniently; for the men in the tents are not yet our friends.


4.5.4
2079
οἱ μὲν δὴ Μῆδοι καὶ οἱ ἀμφὶ Τιγράνην ἐλοῦντο , καί , ἦν γὰρ παρεσκευασμένα , καὶ ἱμάτια μεταλαβόντες ἐδείπνουν , καὶ οἱ ἵπποι αὐτοῖς εἶχον τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ·
Then the Medes and Tigranes and his men bathed, changed their clothes (for they were provided with a change), and went to dinner.


4.5.4
2080
καὶ τοῖς Πέρσαις δὲ ἔπεμπον τῶν ἄρτων τοὺς ἡμίσεις .
Their horses also were provided for.


4.5.4
2081
ὄψον δὲ οὐκ ἔπεμπον οὐδ’ οἶνον , οἰόμενοι ἔχειν τοὺς ἀμφὶ Κῦρον ἔτι ἄφθονα ταῦτα .
Of the bread, half was sent to the Persians; but neither meat for relish nor wine was sent, for they thought that Cyrus and his men had those articles left in abundance.


4.5.4
2082
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ταῦτα ἔλεγεν ὄψον μὲν τὸν λιμόν , πιεῖν δ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ παραρρέοντος ποταμοῦ .
But what Cyrus meant was that hunger was their relish and that they could drink from the river that flowed by.


4.5.5
2083
ὁ μὲν οὖν Κῦρος δειπνίσας τοὺς Πέρσας , ἐπεὶ συνεσκότασε , κατὰ πεμπάδας καὶ κατὰ δεκάδας πολλοὺς αὐτῶν διέπεμψε καὶ ἐκέλευσε κύκλῳ τοῦ στρατοπέδου κρυπτεύειν , νομίζων ἅμα μὲν φυλακὴν ἔσεσθαι , ἄν τις ἔξωθεν προσίῃ , ἅμα δέ , ἄν τις ἔξω φέρων χρήματα ἀποδιδράσκῃ , ἁλώσεσθαι αὐτόν ·
Accordingly, when Cyrus had seen that the Persians had their dinner, he sent many of them out, when it was dark, in squads of five and ten, with orders to lie in hiding round about the camp;


4.5.5
2084
καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτω ·
for he thought that they would serve as sentinels, in case any one should come to attack from the outside, and at the same time that they would catch any one who tried to run away with his possessions.


4.5.5
2085
πολλοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἀπεδίδρασκον , πολλοὶ δὲ ἑάλωσαν .
And it turned out so; for many did try to run away, and many were caught.


4.5.6
2086
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τὰ μὲν χρήματα τοὺς λαβόντας εἴα ἔχειν , τοὺς δὲ ἀνθρώπους ἀποσφάξαι ἐκέλευσεν ·
And Cyrus permitted those who effected the capture to keep the spoil, but the men he bade them slay;


4.5.6
2087
ὥστε τοῦ λοιποῦ οὐδὲ βουλόμενος ἂν ηὗρες ῥᾳδίως τὸν νύκτωρ πορευόμενον .
and so after that you could not easily have found, had you tried, any one attempting to get away by night.


4.5.7
2088
οἱ μὲν δὴ Πέρσαι οὕτω διῆγον ·
Thus, then, the Persians employed their time;


4.5.7
2089
οἱ δὲ Μῆδοι καὶ ἔπινον καὶ εὐωχοῦντο καὶ ηὐλοῦντο καὶ πάσης εὐθυμίας ἐνεπίμπλαντο ·
but the Medes drank and revelled and listened to the music of the flute and indulged themselves to the full with all sorts of merry-making.


4.5.7
2090
πολλὰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἥλω , ὥστε μὴ ἀπορεῖν ἔργου τοὺς ἐγρηγορότας .
For many things that contribute to pleasure had been captured, so that those who stayed awake were at no loss for something to do.


4.5.8
2091
ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης ὁ τῶν Μήδων βασιλεὺς τὴν μὲν νύκτα ἐν ᾗ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ Κῦρος αὐτός τε ἐμεθύσκετο μεθ’ ὧνπερ ἐσκήνου ὡς ἐπ’ εὐτυχίᾳ , καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους δὲ Μήδους ᾤετο παρεῖναι ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ πλὴν ὀλίγων , ἀκούων θόρυβον πολύν ·
Now the night in which Cyrus had marched out, Cyaxares, the king of the Medes, and his messmates got drunk in celebration of their success;


4.5.8
2092
οἱ γὰρ οἰκέται τῶν Μήδων , ἅτε τῶν δεσποτῶν ἀπεληλυθότων , ἀνειμένως ἔπινον καὶ ἐθορύβουν , ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου στρατεύματος καὶ οἶνον καὶ ἄλλα πολλὰ εἰληφότες .
and he supposed that the rest of the Medes were all in camp except a few, for he heard a great racket. For inasmuch as their masters had gone off, the servants of the Medes were drinking and carousing without restraint, especially as they had taken from the Assyrian army wine and many other supplies.


4.5.9
2093
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο , καὶ ἐπὶ θύρας οὐδεὶς ἧκε πλὴν οἵπερ καὶ συνεδείπνουν , καὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ἤκουε κενὸν εἶναι τῶν Μήδων καὶ τῶν ἱππέων , καὶ ἑώρα , ἐπειδὴ ἐξῆλθεν , οὕτως ἔχοντα , ἐνταῦθα δὴ ἐβριμοῦτό τε τῷ Κύρῳ καὶ τοῖς Μήδοις τῷ καταλιπόντας αὐτὸν ἔρημον οἴχεσθαι , καὶ εὐθύς , ὥσπερ λέγεται ὠμὸς εἶναι καὶ ἀγνώμων , τῶν παρόντων κελεύει τινὰ λαβόντα τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ ἱππέας πορεύεσθαι ὡς τάχιστα ἐπὶ τὸ ἀμφὶ Κῦρον στράτευμα καὶ λέγειν τάδε .
But when it was day and no one came to his headquarters except those who had been dining with him, and when he heard that the camp was forsaken by the Medes and the cavalry, and when he discovered on going out that such was really the case, then he fumed and raged against both Cyrus  and the Medes because they had gone off and left him deserted. And straightway, in keeping with his reputation for being violent and unreasonable, he ordered one of those present to take his own cavalry corps and proceed at topmost speed to Cyrus’s army and deliver the following message:


4.5.10
2094
ὤιμην μὲν ἔγωγε , οὐδ’ ἂν σέ , ὦ Κῦρε , περὶ ἐμοῦ οὕτως ἀπρονοήτως βουλεῦσαι , εἰ δὲ Κῦρος οὕτω γιγνώσκοι , οὐκ ἂν ὑμᾶς , ὦ Μῆδοι , ἐθελῆσαι οὕτως ἔρημον ἐμὲ καταλιπεῖν .
I should think that even you, Cyrus , would not have shown such want of consideration toward me; and if Cyrus were so minded, I should think that at least you Medes would not have consented to leave me thus deserted.


4.5.10
2095
καὶ νῦν , ἂν μὲν Κῦρος βούληται , εἰ δὲ μή , ὑμεῖς γε τὴν ταχίστην πάρεστε .
And now, if Cyrus will, let him come with you; if not, do you at least return to me as speedily as possible.


4.5.11
2096
ταῦτα δὴ ἐπέστειλεν .
Such was his message.


4.5.11
2097
ὁ δὲ ταττόμενος πορεύεσθαι ἔφη ·
But he to whom he gave the marching order said:


4.5.11
2098
καὶ πῶς , ὦ δέσποτα , ἐγὼ εὑρήσω ἐκείνους ;
And how shall I find them, your majesty?


4.5.11
2099
πῶς δὲ Κῦρος , ἔφη , καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπορεύοντο ;
How, he answered, did Cyrus and those with him find those against whom they went?


4.5.11
2100
ὅτι νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , ἀκούω ἀφεστηκότας τῶν πολεμίων Ὑρκανίους τινὰς καὶ ἐλθόντας δεῦρο οἴχεσθαι ἡγουμένους αὐτῷ .
Why said the man, by Zeus, I am told that some Hyrcanians who had deserted from the enemy came hither and went away as his guides.


4.5.12
2101
ἀκούσας δὲ ταῦτα ὁ Κυαξάρης πολὺ μᾶλλον ἔτι τῷ Κύρῳ ὠργίζετο τῷ μηδ’ εἰπεῖν αὐτῷ ταῦτα , καὶ πολλῇ σπουδῇ μᾶλλον ἔπεμπεν ἐπὶ τοὺς Μήδους , ὡς ψιλώσων αὐτόν , καὶ ἰσχυρότερον ἔτι ἢ πρόσθεν τοῖς Μήδοις ἀπειλῶν ἀπεκάλει , καὶ τῷ πεμπομένῳ δὲ ἠπείλει , εἰ μὴ ἰσχυρῶς ταῦτα ἀπαγγέλλοι .
Upon hearing this, Cyaxares was much more angry than ever with Cyrus  for not even having told him that, and he sent off in greater haste to recall the Medes, for he hoped to strip him of his forces; and with even more violent threats than before, he ordered the Medes to return. And he threatened the messenger also if he did not deliver his message in all its emphasis.


4.5.13
2102
ὁ μὲν δὴ πεμπόμενος ἐπορεύετο ἔχων τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ ἱππέας ὡς ἑκατόν , ἀνιώμενος ὅτι οὐ καὶ αὐτὸς τότε ἐπορεύθη μετὰ τοῦ Κύρου .
Accordingly, the officer assigned to this duty set out with his cavalry, about a hundred in number, vexed with himself for not having gone along with Cyrus when he went.


4.5.13
2103
ἐν δὲ τῇ ὁδῷ πορευόμενοι διασχισθέντες τρίβῳ τινὶ ἐπλανῶντο , καὶ οὐ πρόσθεν ἀφίκοντο ἐπὶ τὸ φίλιον στράτευμα πρὶν ἐντυχόντες ἀποχωροῦσί τισι τῶν Ἀσσυρίων ἠνάγκασαν αὐτοὺς ἡγεῖσθαι ·
And as they proceeded on their journey, they were misled by a certain by-path and so lost their way and did not reach the army of their friends until they fell in with some deserters from the Assyrians and compelled them to act as their guides.


4.5.13
2104
καὶ οὕτως ἀφικνοῦνται τὰ πυρὰ κατιδόντες ἀμφὶ μέσας πως νύκτας .
And so they came in sight of the camp-fires sometime about midnight.


4.5.14
2105
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐγένοντο πρὸς τῷ στρατοπέδῳ , οἱ φύλακες , ὥσπερ εἰρημένον ἦν ὑπὸ Κύρου , οὐκ εἰσέφρηκαν αὐτοὺς πρὸ ἡμέρας .
And when they came up to the camp, the sentinels, following the instructions of Cyrus, refused to admit them before daylight.


4.5.14
2106
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἡμέρα ὑπέφαινε , πρῶτον μὲν τοὺς μάγους καλέσας ὁ Κῦρος τὰ τοῖς θεοῖς νομιζόμενα ἐπὶ τοῖς τοιούτοις ἀγαθοῖς ἐξαιρεῖσθαι ἐκέλευε .
Now at peep of day the first thing that Cyrus did was to call the magi and bid them select the gifts ordained for the gods in acknowledgment of such success;


4.5.15
2107
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀμφὶ ταῦτα εἶχον ·
and they proceeded to attend to this.


4.5.15
2108
ὁ δὲ συγκαλέσας τοὺς ὁμοτίμους εἶπεν ·
And he called the peers together and said:


4.5.15
2109
ἄνδρες , ὁ μὲν θεὸς προφαίνει πολλὰ κ- ἀγαθά ·
Friends, God holds out before us many blessings.


4.5.15
2110
ἡμεῖς δὲ οἱ Πέρσαι ἐν τῷ παρόντι ὀλίγοι ἐσμὲν ὡς ἐγκρατεῖς εἶναι αὐτῶν .
But we Persians are, under the present circumstances, too few to avail ourselves of them.


4.5.15
2111
εἴτε γὰρ ὁπόσα ἂν προσεργασώμεθα , μὴ φυλάξομεν , πάλιν ταῦτα ἀλλότρια ἔσται ·
For if we fail to guard what we win, it will again become the property of others;


4.5.15
2112
εἴτε καταλείψομέν τινας ἡμῶν αὐτῶν φύλακας ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐφ’ ἡμῖν γιγνομένοις , αὐτίκα οὐδεμίαν ἰσχὺν ἔχοντες ἀναφανούμεθα .
and if we leave some of our own men to guard what falls into our possession, it will very soon be found out that we have no strength.


4.5.16
2113
δοκεῖ οὖν μοι ὡς τάχιστα ἰέναι τινὰ ὑμῶν εἰς Πέρσας καὶ διδάσκειν ἅπερ ἐγὼ λέγω , καὶ κελεύειν ὡς τάχιστα ἐπιπέμπειν στράτευμα , εἴπερ ἐπιθυμοῦσι Πέρσαι τὴν ἀρχὴν τῆς Ἀσίας αὐτοῖς καὶ τὴν κάρπωσιν γενέσθαι .
Accordingly, I have decided that one of you should go with all speed to Persia , present my message and ask them to send reinforcements with the utmost dispatch, if the Persians desire to have control of Asia  and the revenues accruing therefrom.


4.5.17
2114
ἴθι μὲν οὖν σύ , ἔφη , ὁ πρεσβύτατος , καὶ ἰὼν ταῦτα λέγε , καὶ ὅτι οὓς ἂν πέμπωσι στρατιώτας , ἐπειδὰν ἔλθωσι παρ’ ἐμέ , ἐμοὶ μελήσει περὶ τροφῆς αὐτοῖς .
Do you, therefore, go, for you are the senior officer, and when you arrive tell them this; and say also that for whatever soldiers they send I will provide maintenance after they come.


4.5.17
2115
ἃ δ’ ἔχομεν ἡμεῖς , ὁρᾷς μὲν αὐτός , κρύπτε δὲ τούτων μηδέν , ὅ τι δὲ τούτων ἐγὼ πέμπων εἰς Πέρσας καλῶς καὶ νομίμως ποιοίην ἂν τὰ μὲν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς τὸν πατέρα ἐρώτα , τὰ δὲ πρὸς τὸ κοινὸν τὰς ἀρχάς .
Conceal from them nothing in regard to what we have, and you see for yourself what there is.


4.5.17
2116
πεμψάντων δὲ καὶ ὀπτῆρας ὧν πράττομεν καὶ φραστῆρας ὧν ἐρωτῶμεν .
And what portion of these spoils honour and the law require that I should send to Persia — in regard to what is due the gods, ask my father; in regard to what is due to the State, ask the authorities.


4.5.17
2117
καὶ σὺ μέν , ἔφη , συσκευάζου καὶ τὸν λόχον προπομπὸν ἄγε .
And let them send men also to observe what we do and to answer our questions. And you, said he, make ready and take your own platoon to escort you.


4.5.18
2118
ἐκ τούτου δὲ καὶ τοὺς Μήδους ἐκάλει , καὶ ἅμα ὁ παρὰ τοῦ Κυαξάρου ἄγγελος παρίσταται , καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τήν τε πρὸς Κῦρον ὀργὴν καὶ τὰς πρὸς Μήδους ἀπειλὰς αὐτοῦ ἔλεγε ·
After this he called in the Medes also and at the same moment the messenger from Cyaxares presented himself and in the presence of all reported his king’s anger against Cyrus and his threats against the Medes;


4.5.18
2119
καὶ τέλος εἶπεν ὅτι ἀπιέναι Μήδους κελεύει , καὶ εἰ Κῦρος μένειν βούλεται .
and at the last he said that Cyaxares ordered the Medes to return, even if Cyrus wished to stay.


4.5.19
2120
οἱ μὲν οὖν Μῆδοι ἀκούσαντες τοῦ ἀγγέλου ἐσίγησαν , ἀποροῦντες μὲν πῶς χρὴ καλοῦντος ἀπειθεῖν , φοβούμενοι δὲ πῶς χρὴ ἀπειλοῦντι ὑπακοῦσαι , ἄλλως τε καὶ εἰδότες τὴν ὠμότητα αὐτοῦ .
On hearing the messenger, therefore, the Medes were silent, for they were at a loss how they could disobey him when he summoned them, and they asked themselves in fear how they could obey him when he threatened so, especially as they had had experience of his fury.


4.5.20
2121
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
But Cyrus said:


4.5.20
2122
ἀλλ’ ἐγώ , ὦ ἄγγελέ τε καὶ Μῆδοι , οὐδέν , ἔφη , θαυμάζω εἰ Κυαξάρης , πολλοὺς μὲν πολεμίους τότ’ ἰδών , ἡμᾶς δὲ οὐκ εἰδὼς ὅ τι πράττομεν , ὀκνεῖ περί τε ἡμῶν καὶ περὶ αὑτοῦ ·
Well, Sir Messenger and you Medes, inasmuch as Cyaxares saw in our first encounter that the enemy were numerous and as he does not know how we have been faring, I am not at all surprised that he is concerned for us and for himself.


4.5.20
2123
ἐπειδὰν δὲ αἴσθηται πολλοὺς μὲν τῶν πολεμίων ἀπολωλότας , πάντας δὲ ἀπεληλαμένους , πρῶτον μὲν παύσεται φοβούμενος , ἔπειτα γνώσεται , ὅτι οὐ νῦν ἔρημος γίγνεται , ἡνίκα οἱ φίλοι αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἐκείνου ἐχθροὺς ἀπολλύουσιν .
But when he discovers that many of the enemy have been slain and all have been routed, in the first place he will banish his fears and in the second place he will realize that he is not deserted now, when his friends are annihilating his enemies.


4.5.21
2124
ἀλλὰ μὴν μέμψεώς γε πῶς ἐσμὲν ἄξιοι , εὖ τε ποιοῦντες ἐκεῖνον καὶ οὐδὲ ταῦτα αὐτοματίσαντες ;
But further, how do we deserve any blame, since we have been doing him good service and have not been doing even that on our own motion?


4.5.21
2125
ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ μὲν ἐκεῖνον ἔπεισα ἐᾶσαί με λαβόντα ὑμᾶς ἐξελθεῖν ·
But I, for my part, first got his consent to march out and take you with me;


4.5.21
2126
ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ ὡς ἐπιθυμοῦντες τῆς ἐξόδου ἠρωτήσατε εἰ ἐξίοιτε καὶ νῦν δεῦρο ἥκετε , ἀλλ’ ὑπ’ ἐκείνου κελευσθέντες ἐξιέναι ὅτῳ ὑμῶν μὴ ἀχθομένῳ εἴη .
while you did not ask whether you might join the expedition and you are not here now because you desired to make such an expedition, but because you were ordered by him to make it — whoever of you was not averse to it.


4.5.21
2127
καὶ ἡ ὀργὴ οὖν αὕτη σάφ’ οἶδα ὑπό τε τῶν ἀγαθῶν πεπανθήσεται καὶ σὺν τῷ φόβῳ λήγοντι ἄπεισι .
This wrath, therefore, I am quite sure, will be assuaged by our successes and will be gone with the passing of his fear.


4.5.22
2128
νῦν μὲν οὖν , ἔφη , σύ τε , ὦ ἄγγελε , ἀνάπαυσαι , ἐπεὶ καὶ πεπόνηκας , ἡμεῖς τε , ὦ Πέρσαι , ἐπεὶ προσδεχόμεθα πολεμίους ἤτοι μαχουμένους γε ἢ πεισομένους παρέσεσθαι , ταχθῶμεν ὡς κάλλιστα ·
Now, therefore, Sir Messenger, said he, take some rest, for you must be fatigued, and since we are expecting the enemy to come either to surrender, or possibly to fight, let us, fellow-Persians, get into line in as good order as possible;


4.5.22
2129
οὕτω γὰρ ὁρωμένους εἰκὸς πλέον προανύτειν ὧν χρῄζομεν .
for if we present such an appearance, it is likely that we shall better promote the accomplishment of what we desire.


4.5.22
2130
σὺ δ’ , ἔφη , ὁ τῶν Ὑρκανίων ἄρχων , ὑπόμεινον προστάξας τοῖς ἡγεμόσι τῶν σῶν στρατιωτῶν ἐξοπλίζειν αὐτούς .
And you, king of Hyrcania, be pleased to order the commanders of your forces to get them under arms, and then attend me here.


4.5.23
2131
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα ποιήσας ὁ Ὑρκάνιος προσῆλθε , λέγει ὁ Κῦρος ·
And when the Hyrcanian had done so and returned, Cyrus said:


4.5.23
2132
ἐγὼ δέ , ἔφη , ὦ Ὑρκάνιε , ἥδομαι αἰσθανόμενος ὅτι οὐ μόνον φιλίαν ἐπιδεικνύμενος πάρει , ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύνεσιν φαίνῃ μοι ἔχειν .
I am delighted, king of Hyrcania, to see that you not only show me your friendship by your presence, but also that you evidently possess good judgment.


4.5.23
2133
καὶ νῦν ὅτι συμφέρει ἡμῖν τ- αὐτὰ δῆλον ·
And now it is evident that our interests are identical.


4.5.23
2134
ἐμοί τε γὰρ πολέμιοι Ἀσσύριοι , σοί τε νῦν ἔτι ἐχθίονές εἰσιν ἢ ἐμοί ·
For the Assyrians are enemies to me, and now they are still more hostile to you than to me.


4.5.24
2135
οὕτως οὖν ἡμῖν ἀμφοτέροις βουλευτέον ὅπως τῶν μὲν νῦν παρόντων μηδεὶς ἀποστατήσει ἡμῖν συμμάχων , ἄλλους δέ , ἂν δυνώμεθα , προσληψόμεθα .
Under these circumstances, we must both take counsel that none of the allies now present shall desert us, and also that, if we can, we may secure other allies besides.


4.5.24
2136
τοῦ δὲ Μήδου ἤκουες ἀποκαλοῦντος τοὺς ἱππέας ·
Now you heard the Mede recalling the cavalry;


4.5.24
2137
εἰ δ’ οὗτοι ἀπίασιν , ἡμεῖς μόνοι οἱ πεζοὶ μενοῦμεν .
and if they go away, we only, the infantry, shall be left.


4.5.25
2138
οὕτως οὖν δεῖ ποιεῖν ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ ὅπως ὁ ἀποκαλῶν οὗτος καὶ αὐτὸς μένειν παρ’ ἡμῖν βουλήσεται .
Accordingly, it is necessary for you and for me to do all we can to make this man also who is recalling them desire to remain with us himself.


4.5.25
2139
σὺ μὲν οὖν εὑρὼν σκηνὴν δὸς αὐτῷ ὅπου κάλλιστα διάξει πάντα τὰ δέοντα ἔχων ·
Do you, therefore, find and assign to him a tent where he will have the best kind of a time, with everything he wants;


4.5.25
2140
ἐγὼ δ’ αὖ πειράσομαι αὐτῷ ἔργον τι προστάξαι ὅπερ αὐτὸς ἥδιον πράξει ἢ ἄπεισι ·
while I, for my part, will try to assign him some post that he himself would rather fill than go away.


4.5.25
2141
καὶ διαλέγου δὲ αὐτῷ ὁπόσα ἐλπὶς γενέσθαι ἀγαθὰ πᾶσι τοῖς φίλοις , ἂν ταῦτ’ εὖ γένηται ·
And do you have a talk with him and tell him what wealth we have hopes that all our friends will obtain, if we are successful in this;


4.5.25
2142
ποιήσας μέντοι ταῦτα ἧκε πάλιν παρ’ ἐμέ .
and when you have done this, come back again to me.


4.5.26
2143
ὁ μὲν δὴ Ὑρκάνιος τὸν Μῆδον ᾤχετο ἄγων ἐπὶ σκηνήν ·
Accordingly, the Hyrcanian took the Mede and went away to a tent.


4.5.26
2144
ὁ δ’ εἰς Πέρσας ἰὼν παρῆν συνεσκευασμένος ·
And then the officer who was going to leave for Persia presented himself ready to start.


4.5.26
2145
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος αὐτῷ ἐπέστελλε πρὸς μὲν Πέρσας λέγειν ἃ καὶ πρόσθεν ἐν τῷ λόγῳ δεδήλωται , Κυαξάρῃ δὲ ἀποδοῦναι τὰ γράμματα .
And Cyrus commissioned him to tell the Persians what has been set forth in the foregoing narrative and also to deliver a letter to Cyaxares.


4.5.26
2146
ἀναγνῶναι δέ σοι καὶ τὰ ἐπιστελλόμενα , ἔφη , βούλομαι , ἵνα εἰδὼς αὐτὰ ὁμολογῇς , ἄν τί σε πρὸς ταῦτα ἐρωτᾷ .
Now said he, I wish to read my message to you also, that you may understand its contents and confirm the facts, if he asks you anything in reference to them.


4.5.26
2147
ἐνῆν δὲ ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ τάδε .
Now the contents of the letter ran as follows:


4.5.27
2148
Κῦρος Κυαξάρῃ χαίρειν .
My Dear Cyaxares:


4.5.27
2149
ἡμεῖς σε οὔτε ἔρημον κατελίπομεν ·
We have not left you deserted;


4.5.27
2150
οὐδεὶς γάρ , ὅταν ἐχθρῶν κρατῇ , τότε φίλων ἔρημος γίγνεται ·
for no one is deserted by his friends at a time when he is conquering his enemies.


4.5.27
2151
οὐδὲ μὴν ἀποχωροῦντές γέ σε οἰόμεθα ἐν κινδύνῳ καθιστάναι ·
We do not even think that we have brought you into any danger through our departure;


4.5.27
2152
ἀλλὰ ὅσῳ πλέον ἀπέχομεν , τοσούτῳ πλέονά σοι τὴν ἀσφάλειαν ποιεῖν νομίζομεν ·
but we maintain that the farther away we are, the greater the security we provide for you.


4.5.28
2153
οὐ γὰρ οἱ ἐγγύτατα τῶν φίλων καθήμενοι μάλιστα τοῖς φίλοις τὴν ἀσφάλειαν παρέχουσιν , ἀλλ’ οἱ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς μήκιστον ἀπελαύνοντες μᾶλλον τοὺς φίλους ἐν ἀκινδύνῳ καθιστᾶσι .
For it is not those who sit down nearest to their friends that provide them with the greatest security; but it is those who drive the enemy farthest away that help their friends most effectually out of danger.


4.5.29
2154
σκέψαι δὲ οἵῳ ὄντι μοι περὶ σὲ οἷος ὢν περὶ ἐμὲ ἔπειτά μοι μέμφῃ .
And consider how I have acted toward you and how you have acted toward me, and yet in spite of all, you are finding fault with me.


4.5.29
2155
ἐγὼ μέν γέ σοι ἤγαγον συμμάχους , οὐχ ὅσους σὺ ἔπεισας , ἀλλ’ ὁπόσους ἐγὼ πλείστους ἐδυνάμην ·
At all events, I brought you allies — not merely as many as you persuaded to come, but as many as ever I had it in my power to bring;


4.5.29
2156
σὺ δέ μοι ἔδωκας μὲν ἐν τῇ φιλίᾳ ὄντι ὅσους πεῖσαι δυνασθείην ·
whereas you gave to me, when I was on friendly soil, as many as I could persuade to join me,


4.5.29
2157
νῦν δ’ ἐν τῇ πολεμίᾳ ὄντος οὐ τὸν θέλοντα ἀλλὰ πάντας ἀποκαλεῖς .
and now when I am in the enemy’s territory you are recalling not merely those who may be willing to leave me, but all my men.


4.5.30
2158
τοιγαροῦν τότε μὲν ᾠόμην ἀμφοτέροις ὑμῖν χάριν ὀφείλειν ·
Indeed, I thought at that time that I was under obligation both to you and to your men;


4.5.30
2159
νῦν δὲ σύ με ἀναγκάζεις σοῦ μὲν ἐπιλαθέσθαι , τοῖς δὲ ἀκολουθήσασι πειρᾶσθαι πᾶσαν τὴν χάριν ἀποδιδόναι .
but now you are acting so as to force me to leave you out of consideration and to try to devote all my gratitude to those who have followed me.


4.5.31
2160
οὐ μέντοι ἔγωγε σοὶ ὅμοιος δύναμαι γενέσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ νῦν πέμπων ἐπὶ στράτευμα εἰς Πέρσας ἐπιστέλλω , ὁπόσοι ἂν ἴωσιν ὡς ἐμέ , ἤν τι σὺ αὐτῶν δέῃ πρὶν ἡμᾶς ἐλθεῖν , σοὶ ὑπάρχειν , οὐχ ὅπως ἂν θέλωσιν , ἀλλ’ ὅπως ἂν σὺ βούλῃ χρῆσθαι αὐτοῖς .
However, I cannot on my part treat you in the same spirit as you treat me, but at this very moment I am sending to Persia  for reinforcements, with directions that as many as shall come to join me shall be at your service, if you need them for anything before we return, not as they may be pleased to serve, but as you may wish to employ them.


4.5.32
2161
συμβουλεύω δέ σοι καίπερ νεώτερος ὢν μὴ ἀφαιρεῖσθαι ἃ ἂν δῷς , ἵνα μή σοι ἀντὶ χαρίτων ἔχθραι ὀφείλωνται , μηδ’ ὅταν τινὰ βούλῃ πρὸς σὲ ταχὺ ἐλθεῖν , ἀπειλοῦντα μεταπέμπεσθαι , μηδὲ φάσκοντα ἔρημον εἶναι ἅμα πολλοῖς ἀπειλεῖν , ἵνα μὴ διδάσκῃς αὐτοὺς σοῦ μὴ φροντίζειν .
Furthermore, although I am a younger man than you, let me advise you not to take back what you have once given, lest ill-will be your due instead of gratitude, nor to summon with threats those whom you would have come to you quickly; and again let me advise you not to employ threats against large numbers, while at the same time you assert that you are deserted, for fear you teach them to pay no attention to you.


4.5.33
2162
ἡμεῖς δὲ πειρασόμεθα παρεῖναι , ὅταν τάχιστα διαπραξώμεθα ἃ σοί τ’ ἂν καὶ ἡμῖν νομίζομεν πραχθέντα κοινὰ γενέσθαι ἀγαθά .
We shall try, however, to come to you just as soon as we have accomplished what we think it would be a common benefit to you and to us to have done.


4.5.33
2163
ἔρρωσο .
Farewell. Cyrus.


4.5.34
2164
ταύτην αὐτῷ ἀπόδος καὶ ὅ τι ἄν σε τούτων ἐρωτᾷ , ᾗ γέγραπται σύμφαθι .
Deliver this to him and whatever he asks you in regard to these matters, answer him in keeping with what is written.


4.5.34
2165
καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ ἐπιστέλλω σοι περὶ Περσῶν ᾗπερ γέγραπται .
And you can do this with perfect truth, for my instructions to you in regard to the Persians correspond exactly with what is written in my letter.


4.5.34
2166
τούτῳ μὲν οὕτως εἶπε , καὶ δοὺς τὴν ἐπιστολὴν ἀπέπεμπε , προσεντειλάμενος οὕτω σπεύδειν ὥσπερ οἶδεν ὅτι συμφέρει ταχὺ παρεῖναι .
Thus he spoke to him and giving him the letter sent him away, adding the injunction that he should make haste as one who knows that it is important to be back again promptly.


4.5.35
2167
ἐκ τούτου δὲ ἑώρα μὲν ἐξωπλισμένους ἤδη πάντας καὶ τοὺς Μήδους καὶ τοὺς Ὑρκανίους καὶ τοὺς ἀμφὶ Τιγράνην ·
At this moment he observed that all — both the Medes and the Hyrcanians and Tigranes’s men — were already under arms,


4.5.35
2168
καὶ οἱ Πέρσαι δὲ ἐξωπλισμένοι ἦσαν ·
and the Persians also stood under arms.


4.5.35
2169
ἤδη δέ τινες τῶν προσχώρων καὶ ἵππους ἀπῆγον καὶ ὅπλα ἀπέφερον .
And some of the natives from near by were already delivering up horses and arms.


4.5.36
2170
ὁ δὲ τὰ μὲν παλτὰ ὅπουπερ τοὺς πρόσθεν καταβάλλειν ἐκέλευσε , καὶ ἔκαιον οἷς τοῦτο ἔργον ἦν ὁπόσων μὴ αὐτοὶ ἐδέοντο ·
And the javelins he commanded them to throw down in the same place as in the former instance, and they whose task this was burned all that they did not themselves need.


4.5.36
2171
τοὺς δ’ ἵππους ἐκέλευε φυλάττειν μένοντας τοὺς ἀγαγόντας ἕως ἄν τι σημανθῇ αὐτοῖς ·
But as for the horses, he commanded those who brought them to keep them and wait until he sent them word.


4.5.36
2172
τοὺς δὲ ἄρχοντας τῶν ἱππέων καὶ Ὑρκανίων καλέσας τοιάδε ἔλεξεν .
Then he called in the officers of the cavalry and of the Hyrcanians and spoke as follows:


4.5.37
2173
ἄνδρες φίλοι τε καὶ σύμμαχοι , μὴ θαυμάζετε ὅτι πολλάκις ὑμᾶς συγκαλῶ ·
Friends and allies, do not wonder that I call you together so often.


4.5.37
2174
καινὰ γὰρ ἡμῖν ὄντα τὰ παρόντα πολλὰ αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἀσύντακτα ·
For our present situation is novel, and many things about it are in an unorganized condition;


4.5.37
2175
ἃ δ’ ἂν ἀσύντακτα ᾖ , ἀνάγκη ταῦτα ἀεὶ πράγματα παρέχειν , ἕως ἂν χώραν λάβῃ .
and whatever lacks organization must necessarily always cause us trouble until it is reduced to order.


4.5.38
2176
καὶ νῦν ἔστι μὲν ἡμῖν πολλὰ τὰ αἰχμάλωτα χρήματα , καὶ ἄνδρες ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς ·
We now have much spoil that we have taken, and men besides.


4.5.38
2177
διὰ δὲ τὸ μήτε ἡμᾶς εἰδέναι ποῖα τούτων ἑκάστου ἐστὶν ἡμῶν , μήτε τούτους εἰδέναι ὅστις ἑκάστῳ αὑτῶν δεσπότης , περαίνοντας μὲν δὴ τὰ δέοντα οὐ πάνυ ἔστιν ὁρᾶν αὐτῶν πολλούς , ἀποροῦντας δὲ ὅ τι χρὴ ποιεῖν σχεδὸν πάντας .
But, as we do not know how much of it belongs to each one of us, and as the captives do not know who are their several masters, it is consequently impossible to see very many of them attending to their duty, for almost all are in doubt as to what they are expected to do.


4.5.39
2178
ὡς οὖν μὴ οὕτως ἔχῃ , διορίσατε αὐτά ·
In order, therefore, that this may not go on so, divide the spoil;


4.5.39
2179
καὶ ὅστις μὲν ἔλαβε σκηνὴν ἔχουσαν ἱκανὰ καὶ σῖτα καὶ ποτὰ καὶ τοὺς ὑπηρετήσοντας καὶ στρωμνὴν καὶ ἐσθῆτα καὶ τ- ἄλλα οἷς οἰκεῖται σκηνὴ καλῶς στρατιωτική , ἐνταῦθα μὲν οὐδὲν ἄλλο δεῖ προσγενέσθαι ἢ τὸν λαβόντα εἰδέναι ὅτι τούτων ὡς οἰκείων ἐπιμέλεσθαι δεῖ ·
and whoever has been assigned a tent with plenty of food and drink and people to serve him, and bedding and clothing and other things with which a soldier’s tent should be furnished so as to be comfortable — in such a case nothing more need be added, except that he who has received it should be given to understand that he must take care of it as his own.


4.5.39
2180
ὅστις δ’ εἰς ἐνδεόμενά του κατεσκήνωσε , τούτοις ὑμεῖς σκεψάμενοι τὸ ἐλλεῖπον ἐκπληρώσατε , πολλὰ δὲ καὶ τὰ περιττὰ οἶδ’ ὅτι ἔσται ·
But if any one has got into quarters that lack something, do you make a note of it and supply the want.


4.5.40
2181
πλείω γὰρ ἅπαντα ἢ κατὰ τὸ ἡμέτερον πλῆθος εἶχον οἱ πολέμιοι .
And I am sure that what is left over will be considerable, for the enemy had more of everything than is required by our numbers.


4.5.40
2182
ἦλθον δὲ πρὸς ἐμὲ καὶ χρημάτων ταμίαι , οἵ τε τοῦ Ἀσσυρίων βασιλέως καὶ ἄλλων δυναστῶν , οἳ ἔλεγον ὅτι χρυσίον εἴη παρὰ σφίσιν ἐπίσημον , δασμούς τινας λέγοντες .
Furthermore, the treasurers, both of the Assyrian king and of the other monarchs, have come to me to report that they have gold coin in their possession, by which they referred to certain payments of tribute.


4.5.41
2183
καὶ ταῦτα οὖν κηρύττετε πάντα ἀποφέρειν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὅπου ἂν καθέζησθε ·
Notify them, therefore, to deliver all this also to you, wherever you have your headquarters.


4.5.41
2184
καὶ φόβον ἐπιτίθεσθε τῷ μὴ ποιοῦντι τὸ παραγγελλόμενον ·
And give that man reason to fear who shall not do as you command.


4.5.41
2185
ὑμεῖς δὲ διάδοτε λαβόντες ἱππεῖ μὲν τὸ διπλοῦν , πεζῷ δὲ τὸ ἁπλοῦν , ἵνα ἔχητε , ἤν τινος προσδέησθε , καὶ ὅτου ὠνήσεσθε .
And do you take the money and pay it out to the cavalry and infantry in the proportion of two to one, in order that you may all have the wherewithal to buy whatever you still may need.


4.5.42
2186
τὴν δ’ ἀγορὰν τὴν οὖσαν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ κηρυξάτω μὲν ἤδη , ἔφη , μὴ ἀδικεῖν μηδένα , πωλεῖν δὲ τοὺς καπήλους ὅ τι ἔχει ἕκαστος πράσιμον , καὶ ταῦτα διαθεμένους ἄλλα ἄγειν , ὅπως εὖ οἰκῆται ἡμῖν τὸ στρατόπεδον .
Further,  he added,  let the herald proclaim that no one shall interfere with the market in the camp, but that the hucksters may sell what each of them has for sale and, when they have disposed of that, get in a new stock, that our camp may be supplied.


4.5.43
2187
ταῦτα μὲν ἐκήρυττον εὐθύς .
And they proceeded at once to issue the proclamation.


4.5.43
2188
οἱ δὲ Μῆδοι καὶ Ὑρκάνιοι εἶπον ὧδε ·
But the Medes and Hyrcanians asked:


4.5.43
2189
καὶ πῶς ἄν , ἔφασαν , ἡμεῖς ἄνευ σοῦ καὶ τῶν σῶν διανέμοιμεν ταῦτα ;
How could we divide this spoil without help from you and your men?


4.5.44
2190
ὁ δ’ αὖ Κῦρος πρὸς τοῦτον τὸν λόγον ὧδε προσηνέχθη ·
And Cyrus in turn answered their question as follows:


4.5.44
2191
ἦ γὰρ οὕτως , ἔφη , ὦ ἄνδρες , γιγνώσκετε ὡς ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ πραχθῆναι , ἐπὶ πᾶσι πάντας ἡμᾶς δεήσει παρεῖναι , καὶ οὔτε ἐγὼ ἀρκέσω πράττων τι πρὸ ὑμῶν ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ , οὔτε ὑμεῖς πρὸ ἡμῶν ;
Why, my good men, do you really suppose that we must all be present to oversee everything that has to be done,


4.5.44
2192
καὶ πῶς ἂν ἄλλως πλείω μὲν πράγματα ἔχοιμεν , μείω δὲ διαπραττοίμεθα ἢ οὕτως ;
and that I shall not be competent in case of need to do anything on your behalf, nor you again on ours? How else could we make more trouble and accomplish less than in this way?


4.5.45
2193
ἀλλ’ ὁρᾶτε , ἔφη ·
No, said he; you must look to it,


4.5.45
2194
ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ διεφυλάξαμέν τε ὑμῖν τάδε , καὶ ὑμεῖς ἡμῖν πιστεύετε καλῶς διαπεφυλάχθαι ·
for we have kept it for you and you must have confidence in us that we have kept it well;


4.5.45
2195
ὑμεῖς δ’ αὖ διανείματε , καὶ ἡμεῖς πιστεύσομεν ὑμῖν καλῶς διανενεμηκέναι .
now for your part, do you divide it, and we shall have the same confidence in your dividing it fairly.


4.5.46
2196
καὶ ἄλλο δέ τι αὖ ἡμεῖς πειρασόμεθα κοινὸν ἀγαθὸν πράττειν .
And there is something more that we, on our part, shall try to gain for the common advantage.


4.5.46
2197
ὁρᾶτε γὰρ δή , ἔφη , νυνὶ πρῶτον ἵπποι ὅσοι ἡμῖν πάρεισιν , οἱ δὲ προσάγονται ·
For here, you observe, first of all, how many horses we have right now, and more are being brought in.


4.5.46
2198
τούτους οὖν εἰ μὲν ἐάσομεν ἀναμβάτους , ὠφελήσουσι μὲν οὐδὲν ἡμᾶς , πράγματα δὲ παρέξουσιν ἐπιμέλεσθαι ·
If we leave them without riders, they will be of no use to us but will only give us the trouble of looking after them;


4.5.46
2199
ἢν δὲ ἱππέας ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς καταστήσωμεν , ἅμα πραγμάτων τε ἀπαλλαξόμεθα καὶ ἰσχὺν ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς προσθησόμεθα .
but if we put riders upon them, we shall at the same time be rid of the trouble and add strength to ourselves.


4.5.47
2200
εἰ μὲν οὖν ἄλλους ἔχετε οἷστισιν ἂν δοίητε αὐτούς , μεθ’ ὧν ἂν καὶ κινδυνεύοιτε ἥδιον , εἴ τι δέοι , ἢ μεθ’ ἡμῶν , ἐκείνοις δίδοτε ·
If, therefore, you have others to whom you would rather give them and with whom you would rather go into danger, if need should be, than with us, offer them the horses.


4.5.47
2201
εἰ μέντοι ἡμᾶς βούλεσθε παραστάτας μάλιστα ἔχειν ἡμῖν αὐτοὺς δότε .
If, however, you should wish to have us as your comrades in preference to others, give them to us.


4.5.48
2202
καὶ γὰρ νῦν ὅτε ἄνευ ἡμῶν προσελάσαντες ἐκινδυνεύετε , πολὺν μὲν φόβον ἡμῖν παρείχετε μή τι πάθητε , μάλα δὲ αἰσχύνεσθαι ἡμᾶς ἐποιήσατε ὅτι οὐ παρῆμεν ὅπουπερ ὑμεῖς ·
And I have good reasons for asking; for just now when you rode on into danger without us, you filled us with apprehension lest something should happen to you and made us very much ashamed because we were not at your side.


4.5.48
2203
ἢν δὲ λάβωμεν τοὺς ἵππους , ἑψόμεθα ὑμῖν .
But if we get the horses, we shall follow you next time.


4.5.49
2204
κἂν μὲν δοκῶμεν ὠφελεῖν πλέον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν συναγωνιζόμενοι , οὕτω προθυμίας οὐδὲν ἐλλείψομεν ·
And if it seems that we are of more use to you by fighting with you on horseback, in that case we shall not fail for want of courage.


4.5.49
2205
ἢν δὲ πεζοὶ γενόμενοι δοκῶμεν καιριωτέρως ἂν παρεῖναι , τό τε καταβῆναι ἐν μέσῳ καὶ εὐθὺς πεζοὶ ὑμῖν παρεσόμεθα ·
But if it seems that by turning footmen again we could assist to better advantage, it will be open to us to dismount and at once stand by you as foot soldiers;


4.5.49
2206
τοὺς δ’ ἵππους μηχανησόμεθα οἷς ἂν παραδοίημεν .
and as for the horses, we shall manage to find some one to whom we may entrust them.


4.5.50
2207
ὁ μὲν οὕτως ἔλεξεν ·
Thus he spoke,


4.5.50
2208
οἱ δὲ ἀπεκρίναντο ·
and they made answer:


4.5.50
2209
ἀλλ’ ἡμεῖς μέν , ὦ Κῦρε , οὔτ’ ἄνδρας ἔχομεν οὓς ἀναβιβάσαιμεν ἂν ἐπὶ τούτους τοὺς ἵππους , οὔτ’ εἰ εἴχομεν , σοῦ ταῦτα βουλομένου ἄλλο ἂν ἀντὶ τούτων ᾑρούμεθα .
Well, Cyrus, we have no men whom we could mount upon these horses; and if we had, we should not choose to make any other disposition of them, since this is what you desire.


4.5.50
2210
καὶ νῦν , ἔφασαν , τούτους λαβὼν ποίει ὅπως ἄριστόν σοι δοκεῖ εἶναι .
So now, they added, take them and do as you think best.


4.5.51
2211
ἀλλὰ δέχομαί τε , ἔφη , καὶ ἀγαθῇ τύχῃ ἡμεῖς τε ἱππεῖς γενοίμεθα καὶ ὑμεῖς διέλοιτε τὰ κοινά .
Well, said he, I accept them; may good fortune attend our turning into horsemen and your dividing the common spoils.


4.5.51
2212
πρῶτον μὲν οὖν τοῖς θεοῖς , ἔφη , ἐξαιρεῖτε ὅ τι ἂν οἱ μάγοι ἐξηγῶνται ·
In the first place, set apart for the gods whatever the magi direct, as they interpret the will of the gods.


4.5.51
2213
ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ Κυαξάρῃ ἐκλέξασθε ὁποῖ’ ἂν οἴεσθε αὐτῷ μάλιστα χαρίζεσθαι .
Next select for Cyaxares also whatever you think would be most acceptable to him.


4.5.52
2214
καὶ οἳ γελάσαντες εἶπον ὅτι γυναῖκας ἐξαιρετέον εἴη .
They laughed and said that they would have to choose women for him.


4.5.52
2215
γυναῖκάς τε τοίνυν ἐξαιρεῖτε , ἔφη , καὶ ἄλλο ὅ τι ἂν δοκῇ ὑμῖν .
Choose women then, said he, and whatever else you please.


4.5.52
2216
ἐπειδὰν δ’ ἐκείνῳ ἐξέλητε , τοὺς ἐμοί , ὦ Ὑρκάνιοι , ἐθελουσίους τούτους ἐπισπομένους πάντας ἀμέμπτους ποιεῖτε εἰς δύναμιν .
And when you have made your choice for him, then do you Hyrcanians do all you can to see that all those who volunteered to follow me have no cause to complain.


4.5.53
2217
ὑμεῖς δ’ αὖ , ὦ Μῆδοι , τοὺς πρώτους συμμάχους γενομένους τιμᾶτε τούτους , ὅπως εὖ βεβουλεῦσθαι ἡγήσωνται ἡμῖν φίλοι γενόμενοι .
And do you Medes, in your turn, show honour to those who first became our allies, that they may think that they have been well advised in becoming our friends.


4.5.53
2218
νείματε δὲ πάντων τὸ μέρος καὶ τῷ παρὰ Κυαξάρου ἥκοντι αὐτῷ τε καὶ τοῖς μετ’ αὐτοῦ ·
And allot his proper share of everything to the envoy who came from Cyaxares and to those who attended him;


4.5.53
2219
καὶ συνδιαμένειν δὲ παρακαλεῖτε , ὡς ἐμοὶ τοῦτο συνδοκοῦν , ἵνα καὶ Κυαξάρῃ μᾶλλον εἰδὼς περὶ ἑκάστου ἀπαγγείλῃ τὰ ὄντα .
and invite him also to stay on with us (and give him to understand that this is my pleasure also), so that he may know better the true state of things and report the facts to Cyaxares concerning each particular.


4.5.54
2220
Πέρσαις δ’ , ἔφη , τοῖς μετ’ ἐμοῦ , ὅσα ἂν περιττὰ γένηται ὑμῶν καλῶς κατεσκευασμένων , ταῦτα ἀρκέσει ·
As for the Persians with me, he said, what is left after you are amply provided for will suffice for us;


4.5.54
2221
καὶ γάρ , ἔφη , μάλα πως ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἐν χλιδῇ τεθράμμεθα ἀλλὰ χωριτικῶς , ὥστε ἴσως ἂν ἡμῶν καταγελάσαιτε , εἴ τι σεμνὸν ἡμῖν περιτεθείη , ὥσπερ , ἔφη , οἶδ’ ὅτι πολὺν ὑμῖν γέλωτα παρέξομεν καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων καθήμενοι , οἶμαι δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καταπίπτοντες .
for we have not been reared in any sort of luxury, but altogether in rustic fashion, so that you would perhaps laugh at us, if anything gorgeous were to be put upon us, even as we shall, I know, furnish you no little cause for laughter when we are seated upon our horses, and, I presume, he added, when we fall off upon the ground.


4.5.55
2222
ἐκ τούτου οἱ μὲν ᾖσαν ἐπὶ τὴν διαίρεσιν , μάλα ἐπὶ τῷ ἱππικῷ γελῶντες ·
Hereupon they proceeded to the division of the spoil, laughing heartily at his joke about the Persian horsemanship,


4.5.55
2223
ὁ δὲ τοὺς ταξιάρχους καλέσας ἐκέλευσε τοὺς ἵππους λαμβάνειν καὶ τὰ τῶν ἵππων σκεύη καὶ τοὺς ἱπποκόμους , καὶ ἀριθμήσαντας διαλαβεῖν κληρωσαμένους εἰς τάξιν ἴσους ἑκάστοις .
while he called his captains and ordered them to take the horses and the grooms and the trappings of the horses, and to count them off and divide them by lot so that they should each have an equal share for each company.


4.5.56
2224
αὖθις δὲ ὁ Κῦρος ἀνειπεῖν ἐκέλευσεν , εἴ τις εἴη ἐν τῷ Ἀσσυρίων ἢ Σύρων ἢ Ἀραβίων στρατεύματι ἀνὴρ δοῦλος ἢ Μήδων ἢ Περσῶν ἢ Βακτρίων ἢ Καρῶν ἢ Κιλίκων ἢ Ἑλλήνων ἢ ἄλλοθέν ποθεν βεβιασμένος , ἐκφαίνεσθαι .
And again Cyrus  ordered proclamation to be made that if there were any one from Media or Persia  or Bactria  or Caria  or Greece  or anywhere else forced into service as a slave in the army of the Assyrians or Syrians or Arabians, he should show himself.


4.5.57
2225
οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες τοῦ κήρυκος ἄσμενοι πολλοὶ προυφάνησαν ·
And when they heard the herald’s proclamation, many came forward gladly.


4.5.57
2226
ὁ δ’ ἐκλεξάμενος αὐτῶν τοὺς τὰ εἴδη βελτίστους ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἐλευθέρους αὐτοὺς ὄντας δεήσει ὅπλα ὑποφέρειν ἃ ἂν αὐτοῖς διδῶσι ·
And he selected the finest looking of them and told them that they should be made free, but that they would have to act as carriers of any arms given them to carry;


4.5.57
2227
τὰ δ’ ἐπιτήδεια ὅπως ἂν ἔχωσιν ἔφη αὑτῷ μελήσειν .
and for their sustenance he himself, he said, would make provision.


4.5.58
2228
καὶ εὐθὺς ἄγων πρὸς τοὺς ταξιάρχους συνέστησεν αὐτούς , καὶ ἐκέλευσε τά τε γέρρα καὶ τὰς ψιλὰς μαχαίρας τούτοις δοῦναι , ὅπως ἔχοντες σὺν τοῖς ἵπποις ἕπωνται , καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τούτοις ὥσπερ καὶ τοῖς μετ’ αὐτοῦ Πέρσαις λαμβάνειν , αὐτοὺς δὲ τοὺς θώρακας καὶ τὰ ξυστὰ ἔχοντας ἀεὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων ὀχεῖσθαι , καὶ αὐτὸς οὕτω ποιῶν κατῆρχεν , ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς πεζοὺς τῶν ὁμοτίμων ἀνθ’ αὑτοῦ ἕκαστον καθιστάναι ἄλλον ἄρχοντα τῶν ὁμοτίμων .
And so he led them at once to his captains and presented them, bidding his men give them their shields and swords without belts, that they might carry them and follow after the horses. Furthermore, he bade his captains draw rations for them just as for the Persians under him. The Persians, moreover, he bade always ride on horseback with their corselets and lances, and he himself set the example of doing so. He also instructed each one of the newly-mounted officers to appoint some other peer to take his place of command over the infantry of the peers.


4.6.1
2229
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἀμφὶ ταῦτα εἶχον .
Thus, then, they were occupied.


4.6.1
2230
Γωβρύας δ’ ἐν τούτῳ παρῆν Ἀσσύριος πρεσβύτης ἀνὴρ ἐφ’ ἵππου σὺν ἱππικῇ θεραπείᾳ ·
Meanwhile Gobryas, an Assyrian, a man well advanced in years, came up on horseback with a cavalry escort;


4.6.1
2231
εἶχον δὲ πάντες τὰ ἐφίππων ὅπλα .
and they all carried cavalry weapons.


4.6.1
2232
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐπὶ τῷ τὰ ὅπλα παραλαμβάνειν τεταγμένοι ἐκέλευον παραδιδόναι τὰ ξυστά , ὅπως κατακαίοιεν ὥσπερ τ- ἄλλα .
And those who were assigned to the duty of receiving the weapons ordered them to surrender their spears, that they might burn them as they had done with the rest.


4.6.1
2233
ὁ δὲ Γωβρύας εἶπεν ὅτι Κῦρον πρῶτον βούλοιτο ἰδεῖν ·
But Gobryas said that he wished to see Cyrus first.


4.6.1
2234
καὶ οἱ ὑπηρέται τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ἱππέας αὐτοῦ κατέλιπον , τὸν δὲ Γωβρύαν ἄγουσι πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον .
Then the officers left the rest of the horsemen there, but Gobryas they conducted to Cyrus.


4.6.2
2235
ὁ δ’ ὡς εἶδε τὸν Κῦρον , ἔλεξεν ὧδε ·
And when he saw Cyrus, he spoke as follows:


4.6.2
2236
ὦ δέσποτα , ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ μὲν γένος Ἀσσύριος ·
Sire, I am by birth an Assyrian;


4.6.2
2237
ἔχω δὲ καὶ τεῖχος ἰσχυρὸν καὶ χώρας ἐπάρχω πολλῆς ·
I have also a castle, and wide are the domains which I govern.


4.6.2
2238
καὶ ἵππον ἔχω εἰς χιλίαν , ἣν τῷ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων βασιλεῖ παρειχόμην καὶ φίλος ἦν ἐκείνῳ ὡς μάλιστα ·
I have also about a thousand horse which I used to put at the disposal of the Assyrian king, and I used to be his most devoted friend.


4.6.2
2239
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐκεῖνος τέθνηκεν ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς ὤν , ὁ δὲ παῖς ἐκείνου τὴν ἀρχὴν ἔχει ἔχθιστος ὢν ἐμοί , ἥκω πρὸς σὲ καὶ ἱκέτης προσπίπτω καὶ δίδωμί σοι ἐμαυτὸν δοῦλον καὶ σύμμαχον , σὲ δὲ τιμωρὸν αἰτοῦμαι ἐμοὶ γενέσθαι ·
But since he has been slain by you, excellent man that he was, and since his son, who is my worst enemy, has succeeded to his crown, I have come to you and fall a suppliant at your feet. I offer myself to be your vassal and ally and ask that you will be my avenger;


4.6.2
2240
καὶ παῖδα οὕτως ὡς δυνατόν σε ποιοῦμαι ·
and thus, in the only way I may, I make you my son,


4.6.2
2241
ἄπαις δ’ εἰμὶ ἀρρένων παίδων .
for I have no male child more.


4.6.3
2242
ὃς γὰρ ἦν μοι μόνος καὶ καλὸς κ- ἀγαθός , ὦ δέσποτα , καὶ ἐμὲ φιλῶν καὶ τιμῶν ὥσπερ ἂν εὐδαίμονα πατέρα παῖς τιμῶν τιθείη , τοῦτον ὁ νῦν βασιλεὺς οὗτος καλέσαντος τοῦ τότε βασιλέως , πατρὸς δὲ τοῦ νῦν , ὡς δώσοντος τὴν θυγατέρα τῷ ἐμῷ παιδί , ἐγὼ μὲν ἀπεπεμψάμην μέγα φρονῶν ὅτι δῆθεν τῆς βασιλέως θυγατρὸς ὀψοίμην τὸν ἐμὸν υἱὸν γαμέτην ·
For he who was my son, my only son, a beautiful and brave young man, Sire, and one who loved me and paid me the filial reverence that would make a father happy


4.6.3
2243
ὁ δὲ νῦν βασιλεὺς εἰς θήραν αὐτὸν παρακαλέσας καὶ ἀνεὶς αὐτῷ θηρᾶν ἀνὰ κράτος , ὡς πολὺ κρείττων αὐτοῦ ἱππεὺς ἡγούμενος εἶναι , ὁ μὲν ὡς φίλῳ συνεθήρα , φανείσης δ’ ἄρκτου διώκοντες ἀμφότεροι , ὁ μὲν νῦν ἄρχων οὗτος ἀκοντίσας ἥμαρτεν , ὡς μήποτε ὤφελεν , ὁ δ’ ἐμὸς παῖς βαλών , οὐδὲν δέον , καταβάλλει τὴν ἄρκτον .
him this present king invited my son to his court purposing to give him his daughter in marriage — and I let him go; for I was proud that, as I flattered myself, I should see my son wedded to the king’s daughter — then, I say, the man who is now king invited him to go hunting with him and gave him permission to do his best in the chase, for he thought that he himself was a much better rider than my son. And my boy went hunting with him as his friend, and when a bear came out, they both gave chase and the present ruler let fly his javelin but missed. Oh! would to God he had not! Then my son threw (as he should not have done) and brought down the bear.


4.6.4
2244
καὶ τότε μὲν δὴ ἀνιαθεὶς ἄρ’ οὗτος κατέσχεν ὑπὸ σκότου τὸν φθόνον ·
And then that man was vexed, to be sure, as it proved, but covered his jealousy in darkness.


4.6.4
2245
ὡς δὲ πάλιν λέοντος παρατυχόντος ὁ μὲν αὖ ἥμαρτεν , οὐδὲν οἶμαι θαυμαστὸν παθών , ὁ δ’ αὖ ἐμὸς παῖς αὖθις τυχὼν κατειργάσατό τε τὸν λέοντα καὶ εἶπεν ·
But when again a lion appeared, he missed again. There was nothing remarkable in that, so far as I can see; but again a second time my son hit his mark and killed the lion and cried, Have I not thrown twice in succession and brought an animal down each time!


4.6.4
2246
ἆρα βέβληκα δὶς ἐφεξῆς καὶ καταβέβληκα θῆρα ἑκατεράκις , ἐν τούτῳ δὴ οὐκέτι κατίσχει ὁ ἀνόσιος τὸν φθόνον , ἀλλ’ αἰχμὴν παρά τινος τῶν ἑπομένων ἁρπάσας , παίσας εἰς τὰ στέρνα τὸν μόνον μοι καὶ φίλον παῖδα ἀφείλετο τὴν ψυχήν .
Then that villain no longer restrained his jealous wrath but, snatching a spear from one of the attendants, smote him in the breast — my son, my only, well-loved son — and took away his life.


4.6.5
2247
κ- ἐγὼ μὲν ὁ τάλας νεκρὸν ἀντὶ νυμφίου ἐκομισάμην καὶ ἔθαψα τηλικοῦτος ὢν ἄρτι γενειάσκοντα τὸν ἄριστον παῖδα τὸν ἀγαπητόν ·
And I, unhappy I, received back a corpse instead of a bridegroom, and, old man that I am, I buried with the first down upon his cheeks my best, my well-beloved son.


4.6.5
2248
ὁ δὲ κατακανὼν ὥσπερ ἐχθρὸν ἀπολέσας οὔτε μεταμελόμενος πώποτε φανερὸς ἐγένετο οὔτε ἀντὶ τοῦ κακοῦ ἔργου τιμῆς τινος ἠξίωσε τὸν κατὰ γῆς .
But the murderer, as if he had slain an enemy, has never shown any repentance, nor has he, to make amends for his wicked deed, ever deigned to show any honour to him beneath the earth.


4.6.5
2249
ὅ γε μὴν πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ συνῴκτισέ με καὶ δῆλος ἦν συναχθόμενός μοι τῇ συμφορᾷ .
His father, however, expressed his sorrow for me and showed that he sympathized with me in my affliction.


4.6.6
2250
ἐγὼ οὖν , εἰ μὲν ἔζη ἐκεῖνος , οὐκ ἄν ποτε ἦλθον πρὸς σὲ ἐπὶ τῷ ἐκείνου κακῷ ·
And so, if he were living, I should never have come to you in a way to do him harm;


4.6.6
2251
πολλὰ γὰρ φιλικὰ ἔπαθον ὑπ’ ἐκείνου καὶ ὑπηρέτησα ἐκείνῳ ·
for I have received many kindnesses at his hands and I have done him many services.


4.6.6
2252
ἐπεὶ δ’ εἰς τὸν τοῦ ἐμοῦ παιδὸς φονέα ἡ ἀρχὴ περιήκει , οὐκ ἄν ποτε τούτῳ ἐγὼ δυναίμην εὔνους γενέσθαι , οὐδὲ οὗτος ἐμὲ εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι φίλον ἄν ποτε ἡγήσαιτο .
But since the sceptre has passed on to the murderer of my son, I could never be loyal to him and I am sure that he would never regard me as a friend.


4.6.6
2253
οἶδε γὰρ ὡς ἐγὼ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔχω καὶ ὡς πρόσθεν φαιδρῶς βιοτεύων νυνὶ διάκειμαι , ἔρημος ὢν καὶ διὰ πένθους τὸ γῆρας διάγων .
For he knows how I feel toward him and how dark my life now is, though once it was so bright; for now I am forsaken and am spending my old age in sorrow.


4.6.7
2254
εἰ οὖν σύ με δέχῃ καὶ ἐλπίδα τινὰ λάβοιμι τῷ φίλῳ παιδὶ τιμωρίας ἄν τινος μετὰ σοῦ τυχεῖν , καὶ ἀνηβῆσαι ἂν πάλιν δοκῶ μοι καὶ οὔτε ζῶν ἂν ἔτι αἰσχυνοίμην οὔτε ἀποθνῄσκων ἀνιώμενος ἂν τελευτᾶν δοκῶ .
If, therefore, you will receive me and I may find some hope of getting with your help some vengeance for my dear son, I think that I should find my youth again and, if I live, I should no longer live in shame; and if I die, I think that I should die without a regret.


4.6.8
2255
ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπε ·
Thus he spoke;


4.6.8
2256
Κῦρος δ’ ἀπεκρίνατο ·
and Cyrus answered:


4.6.8
2257
ἀλλ’ ἤνπερ , ὦ Γωβρύα , καὶ φρονῶν φαίνῃ ὅσαπερ λέγεις πρὸς ἡμᾶς , δέχομαί τε ἱκέτην σε καὶ τιμώρησίν σοι τοῦ παιδὸς σὺν θεοῖς ὑπισχνοῦμαι .
Well, Gobryas, if you prove that you really mean all that you say to us, I not only receive you as a suppliant, but promise you with the help of the gods to avenge the murder of your son.


4.6.8
2258
λέξον δέ μοι , ἔφη , ἐάν σοι ταῦτα ποιῶμεν καὶ τὰ τείχη σε ἔχειν ἐῶμεν καὶ τὴν χώραν καὶ τὰ ὅπλα καὶ τὴν δύναμιν ἥνπερ πρόσθεν εἶχες , σὺ ἡμῖν τί ἀντὶ τούτων ὑπηρετήσεις ;
But tell me, said he, if we do this for you and let you keep your castle and your province and the power which you had before, what service will you do us in return for that?


4.6.9
2259
ὁ δὲ εἶπε ·
The castle, he answered,


4.6.9
2260
τὰ μὲν τείχη , ὅταν ἔλθῃς , οἶκόν σοι παρέξω ·
I will give you for your quarters when you come;


4.6.9
2261
δασμὸν δὲ τῆς χώρας ὅνπερ ἔφερον ἐκείνῳ σοὶ ἀποίσω , καὶ ὅποι ἂν στρατεύῃ συστρατεύσομαι τὴν ἐκ τῆς χώρας δύναμιν ἔχων .
the tribute of the province, which before I used to pay to him, I will pay to you; and whithersoever you march I will march with you at the head of the forces of my province.


4.6.9
2262
ἔστι δέ μοι , ἔφη , καὶ θυγάτηρ παρθένος ἀγαπητὴ γάμου ἤδη ὡραία , ἣν ἐγὼ πρόσθεν μὲν ᾤμην τῷ νῦν βασιλεύοντι γυναῖκα τρέφειν ·
Besides, said he, I have a daughter, a maiden well-beloved and already ripe for marriage. I used once to think that I was rearing her to be the bride of the present king.


4.6.9
2263
νῦν δὲ αὐτή τέ με ἡ θυγάτηρ πολλὰ γοωμένη ἱκέτευσε μὴ δοῦναι αὐτὴν τῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ φονεῖ , ἐγώ τε ὡσαύτως γιγνώσκω .
But now my daughter herself has besought me with many tears not to give her to her brother’s murderer; and I am so resolved myself.


4.6.9
2264
νῦν δέ σοι δίδωμι βουλεύσασθαι καὶ περὶ ταύτης οὕτως ὥσπερ ἂν καὶ ἐγὼ βουλεύων περὶ σοῦ φαίνωμαι .
And now I leave it to you to deal with her as I shall prove to deal with you.


4.6.10
2265
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
According as what you have said is true, Cyrus then made answer,


4.6.10
2266
ἐπὶ τούτοις , ἔφη , ἐγὼ ἀληθευομένοις δίδωμί σοι τὴν ἐμὴν καὶ λαμβάνω τὴν σὴν δεξιάν ·
I give you my right hand and take yours.


4.6.10
2267
θεοὶ δ’ ἡμῖν μάρτυρες ἔστων .
The gods be our witnesses.


4.6.10
2268
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα ἐπράχθη , ἀπιέναι τε κελεύει τὸν Γωβρύαν ἔχοντα τὰ ὅπλα καὶ ἐπήρετο πόση τις ὁδὸς ὡς αὐτὸν εἴη , ὡς ἥξων .
When this was done he bade Gobryas go and keep his arms; he also asked him how far it was to his place, for he meant to go there.


4.6.10
2269
ὁ δ’ ἔλεγεν ·
And he said:


4.6.10
2270
ἢν αὔριον ἴῃς πρῴ , τῇ ἑτέρᾳ ἂν αὐλίζοιο παρ’ ἡμῖν .
If you start to-morrow early in the morning, you would spend the night of the second day with us.


4.6.11
2271
οὕτω δὴ οὗτος μὲν ᾤχετο ἡγεμόνα καταλιπών .
With these words he was gone, leaving a guide behind.


4.6.11
2272
οἱ δὲ Μῆδοι παρῆσαν , ἃ μὲν οἱ μάγοι ἔφρασαν τοῖς θεοῖς ἐξελεῖν , ἀποδόντες τοῖς μάγοις , Κύρῳ δ’ ἐξῃρηκότες τὴν καλλίστην σκηνὴν καὶ τὴν Σουσίδα γυναῖκα , ἣ καλλίστη δὴ λέγεται ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ γυνὴ γενέσθαι , καὶ μουσουργοὺς δὲ δύο τὰς κρατίστας , δεύτερον δὲ Κυαξάρῃ τὰ δεύτερα , τοιαῦτα δὲ ἄλλα ὧν ἐδέοντο ἑαυτοῖς ἐκπληρώσαντες , ὡς μηδενὸς ἐνδεόμενοι στρατεύωνται ·
And then the Medes came in, after they had delivered to the magi what the magi had directed them to set apart for the gods. And they had selected for Cyrus the most splendid tent and the lady of Susa, who was said to be the most beautiful woman in Asia, and two of the most accomplished music-girls; and afterward they had selected for Cyaxares the next best. They had also supplied themselves with such other things as they needed, so that they might continue the campaign in want of nothing; for there was an abundance of everything.


4.6.11
2273
πάντα γὰρ ἦν πολλά .
for there was an abundance of everything.


4.6.12
2274
προσέλαβον δὲ καὶ Ὑρκάνιοι ὧν ἐδέοντο ·
And the Hyrcanians also took what they wanted;


4.6.12
2275
ἰσόμοιρον δὲ ἐποίησαν καὶ τὸν παρὰ Κυαξάρου ἄγγελον ·
and they made the messenger from Cyaxares share alike with them.


4.6.12
2276
τὰς δὲ περιττὰς σκηνὰς ὅσαι ἦσαν Κύρῳ παρέδοσαν , ὡς τοῖς Πέρσαις γένοιντο .
And all the tents that were left over they delivered to Cyrus for the use of his Persians.


4.6.12
2277
τὸ δὲ νόμισμα ἔφασαν , ἐπειδὰν ἅπαν συλλεχθῇ , διαδώσειν ·
The coin they said they would divide, as soon as it was all collected;


4.6.12
2278
καὶ διέδωκαν .
and they made the division.




5.1.1
2279
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἔπραξάν τε καὶ ἔλεξαν .
Such were their words and deeds.


5.1.1
2280
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τὰ μὲν Κυαξάρου ἐκέλευσε διαλαβόντας φυλάττειν οὓς ᾔδει οἰκειοτάτους αὐτῷ ὄντας ·
Then Cyrus ordered the men whom he knew to be Cyaxares’s most intimate friends to divide among themselves the keeping of the king’s portion of the booty.


5.1.1
2281
καὶ ὅσα δὲ ἐμοὶ δίδοτε , ἡδέως , ἔφη , δέχομαι ·
And what you offer me, he added, I accept with pleasure;


5.1.1
2282
χρήσεται δ’ αὐτοῖς ὑμῶν ὁ ἀεὶ μάλιστα δεόμενος .
but it shall always be at the service of any one of you who at any time is most in need of it.


5.1.1
2283
φιλόμουσος δέ τις τῶν Μήδων εἶπε ·
If you please, then, Cyrus, said one of the Medes who was fond of music,


5.1.1
2284
καὶ μὴν ἐγώ , ὦ Κῦρε , τῶν μουσουργῶν ἀκούσας ἑσπέρας ὧν σὺ νῦν ἔχεις , ἤκουσά τε ἡδέως κἄν μοι δῷς αὐτῶν μίαν , στρατεύεσθαι ἄν μοι δοκῶ ἥδιον ἢ οἴκοι μένειν .
when I listened last evening to the music-girls whom you now have, I was entranced; and if you will give me one of them, I should, I think, be more happy to go to war with you than to stay at home.


5.1.1
2285
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Well, said Cyrus,


5.1.1
2286
ἀλλ’ ἐγώ , ἔφη , καὶ δίδωμί σοι καὶ χάριν οἴομαι σοὶ πλείω ἔχειν ὅτι ἐμὲ ᾔτησας ἢ σὺ ἐμοὶ ὅτι λαμβάνεις ·
I will not only give her to you, but I believe that I am under greater obligation to you for your asking than you to me for receiving her;


5.1.1
2287
οὕτως ἐγὼ ὑμῖν διψῶ χαρίζεσθαι .
so thirsty am I to do you favours.


5.1.1
2288
ταύτην μὲν οὖν ἔλαβεν ὁ αἰτήσας .
So he that asked received her.


5.1.2
2289
καλέσας δὲ ὁ Κῦρος Ἀράσπαν Μῆδον , ὃς ἦν αὐτῷ ἐκ παιδὸς ἑταῖρος , ᾧ καὶ τὴν στολὴν ἐκδὺς ἔδωκε τὴν Μηδικήν , ὅτε παρ’ Ἀστυάγους εἰς Πέρσας ἀπῄει , τοῦτον ἐκέλευσε διαφυλάξαι αὐτῷ τήν τε γυναῖκα καὶ τὴν σκηνήν ·
Then Cyrus  called to him Araspas, a Mede, who had been his friend from boyhood — the same one to whom he had given his Median robe when he laid it off as he was returning from Astyages’s court to Persia — and bade him keep for him both the lady and the tent.


5.1.3
2290
ἦν δὲ αὕτη ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ Ἀβραδάτου τοῦ Σουσίου ·
Now this woman was the wife of Abradatas of Susa;


5.1.3
2291
ὅτε δὲ ἡλίσκετο τὸ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων στρατόπεδον , ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς οὐκ ἔτυχεν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ ὤν , ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὸν τῶν Βακτρίων βασιλέα πρεσβεύων ᾤχετο ·
and when the Assyrian camp was taken, her husband happened not to be there, having gone on an embassy to the king of Bactria;


5.1.3
2292
ἔπεμψε δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ Ἀσσύριος περὶ συμμαχίας ·
for the Assyrian king had sent him thither to negotiate an alliance,


5.1.3
2293
ξένος γὰρ ὢν ἐτύγχανε τῷ τῶν Βακτρίων βασιλεῖ ·
because he chanced to be a guest-friend of the Bactrian king.


5.1.3
2294
ταύτην οὖν ἐκέλευσεν ὁ Κῦρος διαφυλάττειν τὸν Ἀράσπαν , ἕως ἂν αὐτὸς λάβῃ .
This, then, was the lady that Cyrus placed in the charge of Araspas, until such a time as he himself should take her.


5.1.4
2295
κελευόμενος δὲ ὁ Ἀράσπας ἐπήρετο ·
And when he received this commission Araspas asked:


5.1.4
2296
ἑώρακας δ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , τὴν γυναῖκα , ἥν με κελεύεις φυλάττειν ;
And have you seen the lady, Cyrus, whom you give into my keeping? said he.


5.1.4
2297
μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , οὐκ ἔγωγε .
No, by Zeus, said Cyrus; not I.


5.1.4
2298
ἀλλ’ ἐγώ , ἔφη , ἡνίκα ἐξῃροῦμέν σοι αὐτήν ·
But I have, said the other.


5.1.4
2299
καὶ δῆτα , ὅτε μὲν εἰσήλθομεν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτῆς , τὸ πρῶτον οὐ διέγνωμεν αὐτήν ·
I saw her when we selected her for you.


5.1.4
2300
χαμαί τε γὰρ ἐκάθητο καὶ αἱ θεράπαιναι πᾶσαι περὶ αὐτήν ·
And when we went into her tent, upon my word, we did not at first distinguish her from the rest;


5.1.4
2301
καὶ τοίνυν ὁμοίαν ταῖς δούλαις εἶχε τὴν ἐσθῆτα ·
for she sat upon the ground and all her handmaids sat around her.


5.1.4
2302
ἐπεὶ δὲ γνῶναι βουλόμενοι ποία εἴη ἡ δέσποινα πάσας περιεβλέψαμεν , ταχὺ πάνυ καὶ πασῶν ἐφαίνετο διαφέρουσα τῶν ἄλλων , καίπερ καθημένη κεκαλυμμένη τε καὶ εἰς γῆν ὁρῶσα .
And she was dressed withal just like her servants; but when we looked round upon them all in our desire to make out which one was the mistress, at once her superiority to all the rest was evident, even though she sat veiled, with her head bowed to the earth.


5.1.5
2303
ὡς δὲ ἀναστῆναι αὐτὴν ἐκελεύσαμεν , συνανέστησαν μὲν αὐτῇ ἅπασαι αἱ ἀμφ’ αὐτήν , διήνεγκε δ’ ἐνταῦθα πρῶτον μὲν τῷ μεγέθει , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τῇ ἀρετῇ καὶ τῇ εὐσχημοσύνῃ , καίπερ ἐν ταπεινῷ σχήματι ἑστηκυῖα .
But when we bade her rise, all her attendants stood up with her,


5.1.5
2304
δῆλα δ’ ἦν αὐτῇ καὶ τὰ δάκρυα στάζοντα , τὰ μὲν κατὰ τῶν πέπλων , τὰ δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας .
and then was she conspicuous among them both for her stature and for her nobility and her grace, even though she stood there in lowly garb. And she could not hide her tears as they fell, some down her dress, some even to her feet.


5.1.6
2305
ὡς δ’ ἡμῶν ὁ γεραίτατος εἶπε , θάρρει , ὦ γύναι ·
Then, when the oldest man in our company said:


5.1.6
2306
καλὸν μὲν γὰρ κ- ἀγαθὸν ἀκούομεν καὶ τὸν σὸν ἄνδρα εἶναι ·
Have no fear, lady; for though we understand that your husband also is a noble man,


5.1.6
2307
νῦν μέντοι ἐξαιροῦμεν ἀνδρί σε εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι οὔτε τὸ εἶδος ἐκείνου χείρονι οὔτε τὴν γνώμην οὔτε δύναμιν ἥττω ἔχοντι , ἀλλ’ ὡς ἡμεῖς γε νομίζομεν , εἴ τις καὶ ἄλλος ἀνήρ , καὶ Κῦρος ἄξιός ἐστι θαυμάζεσθαι , οὗ σὺ ἔσῃ τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε ·
yet we are choosing you out for a man who, be assured, is not his inferior either in comeliness or intelligence or power, but, as we at least think, if there is any man in the world who deserves admiration, that man is Cyrus; and his you shall henceforth be.


5.1.6
2308
ὡς οὖν τοῦτο ἤκουσεν ἡ γυνή , περικατερρήξατό τε τὸν ἄνωθεν πέπλον καὶ ἀνωδύρατο ·
Now when the lady heard that, she rent her outer garment from top to bottom and wept aloud;


5.1.6
2309
συνανεβόησαν δὲ καὶ αἱ δμωαί .
and her servants also cried aloud with her.


5.1.7
2310
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἐφάνη μὲν αὐτῆς τὸ πλεῖστον μέρος τοῦ προσώπου , ἐφάνη δὲ ἡ δέρη καὶ αἱ χεῖρες ·
And then we had vision of most of her face and vision of her neck and arms.


5.1.7
2311
καὶ εὖ ἴσθι , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ὡς ἐμοί τε ἔδοξε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασι τοῖς ἰδοῦσι μήπω φῦναι μηδὲ γενέσθαι γυνὴ ἀπὸ θνητῶν τοιαύτη ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ ·
And let me tell you, Cyrus, said he, it seemed to me, as it did to all the rest who saw her, that there never was so beautiful a woman of mortal birth in Asia.


5.1.7
2312
ἀλλὰ πάντως , ἔφη , καὶ σὺ θέασαι αὐτήν .
But, he added, you must by all means see her for yourself.


5.1.8
2313
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἔφη ·
No, by Zeus, said Cyrus;


5.1.8
2314
ναὶ μὰ Δία , πολύ γε ἧττον , εἰ τοιαύτη ἐστὶν οἵαν σὺ λέγεις .
and all the less, if she is as beautiful as you say.


5.1.8
2315
τί δαί ;
Why so? asked the young man.


5.1.8
2316
ἔφη ὁ νεανίσκος .
Because said he,


5.1.8
2317
ὅτι , ἔφη , εἰ νυνὶ σοῦ ἀκούσας ὅτι καλή ἐστι πεισθήσομαι ἐλθεῖν θεασόμενος , οὐδὲ πάνυ μοι σχολῆς οὔσης , δέδοικα μὴ πολὺ θᾶττον ἐκείνη αὖθις ἀναπείσῃ καὶ πάλιν ἐλθεῖν θεασόμενον ·
if now I have heard from you that she is beautiful and am inclined just by your account of her to go and gaze on her, when I have no time to spare, I am afraid that she will herself much more readily persuade me to come again to gaze on her.


5.1.8
2318
ἐκ δὲ τούτου ἴσως ἂν ἀμελήσας ὧν με δεῖ πράττειν καθήμην ἐκείνην θεώμενος .
And in consequence of that I might sit there, in neglect of my duties, idly gazing upon her.


5.1.9
2319
καὶ ὁ νεανίσκος ἀναγελάσας εἶπεν ·
Why Cyrus, said the young man breaking into a laugh,


5.1.9
2320
οἴει γάρ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ἱκανὸν εἶναι κάλλος ἀνθρώπου ἀναγκάζειν τὸν μὴ βουλόμενον πράττειν παρὰ τὸ βέλτιστον ;
you do not think, do you, that human beauty is able to compel a man against his will to act contrary to his own best interests?


5.1.9
2321
εἰ μέντοι , ἔφη , τοῦτο οὕτως ἐπεφύκει , πάντας ἂν ἠνάγκαζεν ὁμοίως .
Why, said he, if that were a law of nature, it would compel us all alike.


5.1.10
2322
ὁρᾷς , ἔφη , τὸ πῦρ , ὡς πάντας ὁμοίως καίει ;
Do you observe, said he, how fire burns all alike?


5.1.10
2323
πέφυκε γὰρ τοιοῦτον ·
That is its nature.


5.1.10
2324
τῶν δὲ καλῶν τῶν μὲν ἐρῶσι τῶν δ’ οὔ , καὶ ἄλλος γε ἄλλου .
But of beautiful things we love some and some we do not; and one loves one, another another;


5.1.10
2325
ἐθελούσιον γάρ , ἔφη , ἐστί , καὶ ἐρᾷ ἕκαστος ὧν ἂν βούληται ·
for it is a matter of free will, and each one loves what he pleases.


5.1.10
2326
αὐτίκ’ , ἔφη , οὐκ ἐρᾷ ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφῆς , ἄλλος δὲ ταύτης , οὐδὲ πατὴρ θυγατρός , ἄλλος δὲ ταύτης ·
For example, a brother does not fall in love with his sister, but somebody else falls in love with her; neither does a father fall in love with his daughter, but somebody else does;


5.1.10
2327
καὶ γὰρ φόβος καὶ νόμος ἱκανὸς ἔρωτα κωλύειν .
for fear of God and the law of the land are sufficient to prevent such love.


5.1.11
2328
εἰ δέ γ’ , ἔφη , νόμος τεθείη μὴ ἐσθίοντας μὴ πεινῆν καὶ μὴ πίνοντας μὴ διψῆν μηδὲ ῥιγοῦν τοῦ χειμῶνος μηδὲ θάλπεσθαι τοῦ θέρους , οὐδεὶς ἂν νόμος δυνηθείη διαπράξασθαι ταῦτα πείθεσθαι ἀνθρώπους ·
But, he went on, if a law should be passed forbidding those who did not eat to be hungry, those who did not drink to be thirsty, forbidding people to be cold in winter or hot in summer, no such law could ever bring men to obey its provisions,


5.1.11
2329
πεφύκασι γὰρ ὑπὸ τούτων κρατεῖσθαι .
for they are so constituted by nature as to be subject to the control of such circumstances.


5.1.11
2330
τὸ δ’ ἐρᾶν ἐθελούσιόν ἐστιν ·
But love is a matter of free will;


5.1.11
2331
ἕκαστος γοῦν τῶν καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐρᾷ , ὥσπερ ἱματίων καὶ ὑποδημάτων .
at any rate, every one loves what suits his taste, as he does his clothes or shoes.


5.1.12
2332
πῶς οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , εἰ ἐθελούσιόν ·
How then, pray, said Cyrus,


5.1.12
2333
ἐστι τὸ ἐρασθῆναι , οὐ καὶ παύσασθαι ἔστιν ὅταν τις βούληται ;
if falling in love is a matter of free will, is it not possible for any one to stop whenever he pleases?


5.1.12
2334
ἀλλ’ ἐγώ , ἔφη , ἑώρακα καὶ κλαίοντας ὑπὸ λύπης δι’ ἔρωτα , καὶ δουλεύοντάς γε τοῖς ἐρωμένοις καὶ μάλα κακὸν νομίζοντας πρὶν ἐρᾶν τὸ δουλεύειν , καὶ διδόντας γε πολλὰ ὧν οὐ βέλτιον αὐτοῖς στέρεσθαι , καὶ εὐχομένους ὥσπερ καὶ ἄλλης τινὸς νόσου ἀπαλλαγῆναι , καὶ οὐ δυναμένους μέντοι ἀπαλλάττεσθαι , ἀλλὰ δεδεμένους ἰσχυροτέρᾳ τινὶ ἀνάγκῃ ἢ εἰ ἐν σιδήρῳ ἐδέδεντο .
But I have seen people in tears of sorrow because of love and in slavery to the objects of their love, even though they believed before they fell in love that slavery is a great evil; I have seen them give those objects of their love many things that they could ill afford to part with; and I have seen people praying to be delivered from love just as from any other disease, and, for all that, unable to be delivered from it, but fettered by a stronger necessity than if they had been fettered with shackles of iron.


5.1.12
2335
παρέχουσι γοῦν ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἐρωμένοις πολλὰ καὶ εἰκῇ ὑπηρετοῦντας ·
At any rate, they surrender themselves to those they love to perform for them many services blindly.


5.1.12
2336
καὶ μέντοι οὐδ’ ἀποδιδράσκειν ἐπιχειροῦσι , τοιαῦτα κακὰ ἔχοντες , ἀλλὰ καὶ φυλάττουσι τοὺς ἐρωμένους μή ποι ἀποδρῶσι .
And yet, in spite of all their misery, they do not attempt to run away, but even watch their darlings to keep them from running away.


5.1.13
2337
καὶ ὁ νεανίσκος εἶπε πρὸς ταῦτα ·
Yes, the young man answered;


5.1.13
2338
ποιοῦσι γάρ , ἔφη , ταῦτα ·
there are some who do so;


5.1.13
2339
εἰσὶ μέντοι , ἔφη , οἱ τοιοῦτοι μοχθηροί ·
but such are wretched weaklings, and because of their slavery, I think, they constantly pray that they may die, because they are so unhappy;


5.1.13
2340
διόπερ οἶμαι καὶ εὔχονται μὲν αἰεὶ ὡς ἄθλιοι ὄντες ἀποθανεῖν , μυρίων δ’ οὐσῶν μηχανῶν ἀπαλλαγῆς τοῦ βίου οὐκ ἀπαλλάττονται .
but, though there are ten thousand possible ways of getting rid of life, they do not get rid of it.


5.1.13
2341
οἱ αὐτοὶ δέ γε οὗτοι καὶ κλέπτειν ἐπιχειροῦσι καὶ οὐκ ἀπέχονται τῶν ἀλλοτρίων , ἀλλ’ ἐπειδάν τι ἁρπάσωσιν ἢ κλέψωσιν , ὁρᾷς ὅτι σὺ πρῶτος , ὡς οὐκ ἀναγκαῖον ὂν τὸ κλέπτειν , αἰτιᾷ τὸν κλέπτοντα καὶ ἁρπάζοντα , καὶ οὐ συγγιγνώσκεις , ἀλλὰ κολάζεις ;
And this very same sort attempt also to steal and do not keep their hands off other people’s property; but when they commit robbery or theft, you see that you are the first to accuse the thief and the robber, because it was not necessary to steal, and you do not pardon him, but you punish him.


5.1.14
2342
οὕτω μέντοι , ἔφη , καὶ οἱ καλοὶ οὐκ ἀναγκάζουσιν ἐρᾶν ἑαυτῶν οὐδ’ ἐφίεσθαι ἀνθρώπους ὧν μὴ δεῖ , ἀλλὰ τὰ μοχθηρὰ ἀνθρώπια πασῶν οἶμαι τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν ἀκρατῆ ἐστι , κ- ἔπειτα ἔρωτα αἰτιῶνται ·
Now in this same way, the beautiful do not compel people to fall in love with them nor to desire that which they should not, but there are some miserable apologies for men who are slaves to all sorts of passions, I think, and then they blame love.


5.1.14
2343
οἱ δέ γε καλοὶ κ- ἀγαθοὶ ἐπιθυμοῦντες καὶ χρυσίου καὶ ἵππων ἀγαθῶν καὶ γυναικῶν καλῶν , ὅμως πάντων τούτων δύνανται ἀπέχεσθαι ὥστε μὴ ἅπτεσθαι αὐτῶν παρὰ τὸ δίκαιον .
But the high-minded and the good, though they also have a desire for money and good horses and beautiful women, have the power to let all that alone so as not to touch anything beyond the limit of what is right.


5.1.15
2344
ἐγὼ γοῦν , ἔφη , ταύτην ἑωρακὼς καὶ πάνυ καλῆς δοξάσης μοι εἶναι ὅμως καὶ παρὰ σοί εἰμι καὶ ἱππεύω καὶ τ- ἄλλα τὰ ἐμοὶ προσήκοντα ἀποτελῶ .
At any rate,  he added,  I have seen this lady and though she seemed to me surpassingly beautiful, still I am here with you, I practise horsemanship, and I do everything else that it is my duty to do.


5.1.16
2345
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος ·
Aye, by Zeus, said Cyrus;


5.1.16
2346
ἴσως γὰρ θᾶττον ἀπῆλθες ἢ ἐν ὅσῳ χρόνῳ ἔρως πέφυκε συσκευάζεσθαι ἄνθρωπον .
for you came away perhaps in less time than love takes, as its nature is, to get a man ensnared.


5.1.16
2347
καὶ πυρὸς γάρ τοι ἔστι θιγόντα μὴ εὐθὺς καίεσθαι καὶ τὰ ξύλα οὐκ εὐθὺς ἀναλάμπει ·
For, you know, it is possible for a man to put his finger in the fire and not be burned at once, and wood does not burst at once into flame;


5.1.16
2348
ὅμως δ’ ἔγωγε οὔτε πυρὸς ἑκὼν εἶναι ἅπτομαι οὔτε τοὺς καλοὺς εἰσορῶ .
still, for my part, I neither put my hand into the fire nor look upon the beautiful, if I can help it.


5.1.16
2349
οὐδέ γε σοὶ συμβουλεύω , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀράσπα , ἐν τοῖς καλοῖς ἐᾶν τὴν ὄψιν ἐνδιατρίβειν ·
And I advise you, too, Araspas, said he, not to let your eyes linger upon the fair;


5.1.16
2350
ὡς τὸ μὲν πῦρ τοὺς ἁπτομένους καίει , οἱ δὲ καλοὶ καὶ τοὺς ἄπωθεν θεωμένους ὑφάπτουσιν , ὥστε αἴθεσθαι τῷ ἔρωτι .
for fire, to be sure, burns only those who touch it, but beauty insidiously kindles a fire even in those who gaze upon it from afar, so that they are inflamed with passion.


5.1.17
2351
θάρρει , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε ·
Never fear, Cyrus, said he,


5.1.17
2352
οὐδ’ ἐὰν μηδέποτε παύσωμαι θεώμενος , οὐ μὴ κρατηθῶ ὥστε ποιεῖν τι ὧν μὴ χρὴ ποιεῖν .
even if I never cease to look upon her, I shall never be so overcome as to do anything that I ought not.


5.1.17
2353
κάλλιστα , ἔφη , λέγεις ·
Your professions, said he, are most excellent.


5.1.17
2354
φύλαττε τοίνυν , ἔφη , ὥσπερ σε κελεύω καὶ ἐπιμελοῦ αὐτῆς ·
Keep her then, as I bid you, and take good care of her;


5.1.17
2355
ἴσως γὰρ ἂν πάνυ ἡμῖν ἐν καιρῷ γένοιτο αὕτη ἡ γυνή .
for this lady may perhaps be of very great service to us when the time comes.


5.1.18
2356
τότε μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ εἰπόντες διελύθησαν .
After this conversation, then, they separated.


5.1.18
2357
ὁ δὲ νεανίσκος ἅμα μὲν ὁρῶν καλὴν τὴν γυναῖκα , ἅμα δὲ αἰσθανόμενος τὴν καλοκἀγαθίαν αὐτῆς , ἅμα δὲ θεραπεύων αὐτὴν καὶ οἰόμενος χαρίζεσθαι αὐτῇ , ἅμα δὲ αἰσθανόμενος οὐκ ἀχάριστον οὖσαν , ἀλλ’ ἐπιμελομένην διὰ τῶν αὑτῆς οἰκετῶν ὡς καὶ εἰσιόντι εἴη αὐτῷ τὰ δέοντα καὶ εἴ ποτε ἀσθενήσειεν , ὡς μηδενὸς ἐνδέοιτο , ἐκ πάντων τούτων ἡλίσκετο ἔρωτι , καὶ ἴσως οὐδὲν θαυμαστὸν ἔπασχε .
And as the young man found the lady so beautiful and at the same time came to know her goodness and nobility of character, as he attended her and thought he pleased her, and then also as he saw that she was not ungrateful but always took care by the hands of her own servants not only that he should find whatever he needed when he came in, but that, if he ever fell sick, he should suffer no lack of attention — in consequence of all this, he fell desperately in love with her; and what happened to him was perhaps not at all surprising.


5.1.18
2358
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἐπράττετο .
Thus matters began to take this turn.


5.1.19
2359
βουλόμενος δὲ ὁ Κῦρος ἐθελοντὰς μένειν μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ τούς τε Μήδους καὶ τοὺς συμμάχους , συνεκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς ἐπικαιρίους ·
Cyrus , however, wishing to have his Medes and allies stay with him voluntarily, called a meeting of all his staff-officers, and when they were come together he spoke as follows:


5.1.20
2360
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνῆλθον , ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
When they were come together, he spoke as follows:


5.1.20
2361
ἄνδρες Μῆδοι καὶ πάντες οἱ παρόντες , ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς οἶδα σαφῶς ὅτι οὔτε χρημάτων δεόμενοι σὺν ἐμοὶ ἐξήλθετε οὔτε Κυαξάρῃ νομίζοντες τοῦτο ὑπηρετεῖν , ἀλλ’ ἐμοὶ βουλόμενοι τοῦτο χαρίζεσθαι καὶ ἐμὲ τιμῶντες νυκτοπορεῖν καὶ κινδυνεύειν σὺν ἐμοὶ ἠθελήσατε .
Men of Media and all here present, I am very sure that you came out with me, not because you desired to get money by it nor because you thought that in this you were doing Cyaxares a service; but it was to me that you wished to do this favour, and it was out of regard for me that you were willing to make the night-march and to brave dangers with me.


5.1.21
2362
καὶ χάριν τούτων ἐγὼ ὑμῖν ἔχω μέν , εἰ μὴ ἀδικῶ ·
For this also I thank you — I should be in the wrong not to do so;


5.1.21
2363
ἀποδιδόναι δὲ ἀξίαν οὔπω δύναμιν ἔχειν μοι δοκῶ .
but I do not think that I am as yet in a position to make you an adequate return, and this I am not ashamed to say.


5.1.21
2364
καὶ τοῦτο μὲν οὐκ αἰσχύνομαι λέγων ·
But let me assure you, said he, that I should be ashamed to say


5.1.21
2365
τὸ δ’ ἐὰν μένητε παρ’ ἐμοί , ἀποδώσω , τοῦτο , εὖ ἴστε , ἔφη , αἰσχυνοίμην ἂν εἰπεῖν ·
if you will stay with me, I will make you a proper return;


5.1.21
2366
νομίζω γὰρ ἂν ἐμαυτὸν ἐοικέναι λέγοντι ταῦτα ἕνεκα τοῦ ὑμᾶς μᾶλλον ἐθέλειν παρ’ ἐμοὶ καταμένειν .
for I think it would look as if I were saying it merely to make you more willing to stay with me.


5.1.21
2367
ἀντὶ δὲ τούτου τάδε λέγω ·
Instead of that, this is what I mean:


5.1.21
2368
ἐγὼ γὰρ ὑμῖν , κἂν ἤδη ἀπίητε Κυαξάρῃ πειθόμενοι , ὅμως , ἂν ἀγαθόν τι πράξω , πειράσομαι οὕτω ποιεῖν ὥστε καὶ ὑμᾶς ἐμὲ ἐπαινεῖν .
even though you go back now in obedience to Cyaxares, still, if I achieve any success, I shall try so to act that you also will praise me.


5.1.22
2369
οὐ γὰρ δὴ αὐτός γε ἄπειμι , ἀλλὰ καὶ Ὑρκανίοις τοὺς ὅρκους καὶ τὰς δεξιὰς ἃς ἔδωκα ἐμπεδώσω καὶ οὔποτε τούτους προδιδοὺς ἁλώσομαι , καὶ τῷ νῦν διδόντι Γωβρύᾳ καὶ τείχη ἡμῖν καὶ χώραν καὶ δύναμιν πειράσομαι ποιεῖν μὴ μεταμελῆσαι τῆς πρὸς ἐμὲ ὁδοῦ .
For as to myself, I certainly am not going back, but I will be true to the oaths and the pledges which I gave the Hyrcanians, and I will never be caught playing them false; and I will also endeavour so to conduct myself that Gobryas, who is now offering us both his castle and his country and his forces, shall not repent his coming to us.


5.1.23
2370
καὶ τὸ μέγιστον δή , θεῶν οὕτω διδόντων περιφανῶς ἀγαθὰ καὶ φοβοίμην ἂν αὐτοὺς καὶ αἰσχυνοίμην ἀπολιπὼν ταῦτα εἰκῇ ἀπελθεῖν .
And above all, now that the gods are so manifestly blessing our efforts, I should fear to offend them, and I should be ashamed in their sight to go away without good reason and leave what they have bestowed.


5.1.23
2371
ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν οὕτως , ἔφη , ποιήσω ·
Thus, therefore, I propose to act, said he;


5.1.23
2372
ὑμεῖς δὲ ὅπως γιγνώσκετε οὕτω καὶ ποιεῖτε , καὶ ἐμοὶ εἴπατε ὅ τι ἂν ὑμῖν δοκῇ .
and do you also do as you judge to be best, and tell me what your decision is.


5.1.24
2373
ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπε .
Thus he spoke.


5.1.24
2374
πρῶτος δ’ ὁ φήσας ποτὲ συγγενὴς τοῦ Κύρου εἶναι εἶπεν ·
And the first one to reply was the man who had once upon a time claimed to be a kinsman of Cyrus.


5.1.24
2375
ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ μέν , ἔφη , ὦ βασιλεῦ ·
For my part, O my king, said he —


5.1.24
2376
βασιλεὺς γὰρ ἔμοιγε δοκεῖς σὺ φύσει πεφυκέναι οὐδὲν ἧττον ἢ ὁ ἐν τῷ σμήνει φυόμενος τῶν μελιττῶν ἡγεμών ·
for to me you seem to be a born king no less than is the sovereign of the bees in a hive.


5.1.24
2377
ἐκείνῳ τε γὰρ αἱ μέλιτται ἑκοῦσαι μὲν πείθονται , ὅπου δ’ ἂν μένῃ , οὐδεμία ἐντεῦθεν ἀπέρχεται ·
For as the bees always willingly obey the queen-bee and not one of them deserts the place where she stays;


5.1.24
2378
ἐὰν δέ ποι ἐξίῃ , οὐδεμία αὐτοῦ ἀπολείπεται ·
and as not one fails to follow her if she goes anywhere else —


5.1.24
2379
οὕτω δεινός τις ἔρως αὐταῖς τοῦ ἄρχεσθαι ὑπ’ ἐκείνου ἐγγίγνεται .
so marvellous a yearning to be ruled by her is innate to them;


5.1.25
2380
καὶ πρὸς σὲ δέ μοι δοκοῦσι παραπλησίως πως οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὕτω διακεῖσθαι .
so also do men seem to me to be drawn by something like the same sort of instinct toward you.


5.1.25
2381
καὶ γὰρ εἰς Πέρσας ὅτε παρ’ ἡμῶν ἀπῄεις , τίς Μήδων ἢ νέος ἢ γέρων σοῦ ἀπελείφθη τὸ μή σοι ἀκολουθεῖν ἔστε Ἀστυάγης ἡμᾶς ἀπέστρεψεν ;
And of that we have proof; for when you started to return from our country to Persia, what man of the Medes either young or old failed to follow you, until Astyages made us turn back?


5.1.25
2382
ἐπειδὴ δ’ ἐκ Περσῶν βοηθὸς ἡμῖν ὡρμήθης , σχεδὸν αὖ ἑωρῶμεν τοὺς φίλους σου πάντας ἐθελουσίους συνεπομένους .
And when you hastened to our aid from Persia, we saw that almost all your friends followed with you of their own free will.


5.1.25
2383
ὅτε δ’ αὖ τῆς δεῦρο στρατείας ἐπεθύμησας , πάντες σοι Μῆδοι ἑκόντες ἠκολούθησαν .
Again, when you wished to come out on this expedition, all the Medes volunteered to follow you.


5.1.26
2384
νῦν δ’ αὖ οὕτως ἔχομεν ὡς σὺν μὲν σοὶ ὅμως καὶ ἐν τῇ πολεμίᾳ ὄντες θαρροῦμεν , ἄνευ δὲ σοῦ καὶ οἴκαδε ἀπιέναι φοβούμεθα .
And now, too, this is our feeling, so that with you we are not afraid even in the enemy’s land, while without you we are afraid even to return home.


5.1.26
2385
οἱ μὲν οὖν ἄλλοι ὅπως ποιήσουσιν αὐτοὶ ἐροῦσιν ·
Now the rest may tell for themselves what they mean to do.


5.1.26
2386
ἐγὼ δέ , ὦ Κῦρε , καὶ ὧν ἐγὼ κρατῶ καὶ μενοῦμεν παρὰ σοὶ καὶ ὁρῶντες σὲ ἀνεξόμεθα καὶ καρτερήσομεν ὑπὸ σοῦ εὐεργετούμενοι .
But as for me, Cyrus, I, with the men whom I command, will remain with you and endure the sight of you and tolerate your goodness to us.


5.1.27
2387
ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἔλεξεν ὁ Τιγράνης ὧδε ·
Following him, Tigranes spoke as follows:


5.1.27
2388
σύ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , μήποτε θαυμάσῃς ἂν ἐγὼ σιωπῶ ·
Cyrus, said he, you need never be surprised when I fail to speak.


5.1.27
2389
ἡ γὰρ ψυχή , ἔφη , οὐχ ὡς βουλεύσουσα παρεσκεύασται ἀλλ’ ὡς ποιήσουσα ὅ τι ἂν παραγγέλλῃς .
For my mind has been disciplined not to offer counsel but to do what you command.


5.1.28
2390
ὁ δὲ Ὑρκάνιος εἶπεν ·
Well, Medes, said the Hyrcanian king,


5.1.28
2391
ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ μέν , ὦ Μῆδοι , εἰ νῦν ἀπέλθοιτε , δαίμονος ἂν φαίην τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν εἶναι τὸ μὴ ἐᾶσαι ὑμᾶς μέγα εὐδαίμονας γενέσθαι ·
if you should go away now, I should say that it was the plot of the evil one to prevent your becoming exceedingly blest.


5.1.28
2392
ἀνθρωπίνῃ δὲ γνώμῃ τίς ἂν ἢ φευγόντων πολεμίων ἀποτρέποιτο ἢ ὅπλα παραδιδόντων οὐκ ἂν λαμβάνοι ἢ ἑαυτοὺς διδόντων καὶ τὰ ἑαυτῶν οὐκ ἂν δέχοιτο , ἄλλως τε καὶ τοῦ ἡγεμόνος ἡμῖν ὄντος τοιούτου ὃς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , ὡς ὄμνυμι ὑμῖν πάντας τοὺς θεούς , εὖ ποιῶν ἡμᾶς μᾶλλον ἥδεσθαι ἢ ἑαυτὸν πλουτίζων .
For, in all common sense, who would turn away from the enemy when they are in flight, or refuse to take their arms when they surrender them, or their persons and property when they offer them — especially under such a leader as we have? For, I swear to you by all the gods, he seems to me happier in doing us kindnesses than in enriching himself.


5.1.29
2393
ἐπὶ τούτῳ πάντες οἱ Μῆδοι τοιάδ’ ἔλεγον ·
Following him, all the Medes spoke to this effect:


5.1.29
2394
σύ , ὦ Κῦρε , καὶ ἐξήγαγες ἡμᾶς καὶ οἴκαδε ὅταν ἀπιέναι καιρὸς δοκῇ , σὺν σοὶ ἡμᾶς ἄγε .
It is you, Cyrus, that have brought us out here, and when you think the time to return has come, lead us back with you.


5.1.29
2395
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ταῦτα ἀκούσας ἐπηύξατο ·
And when Cyrus heard that, he uttered this prayer:


5.1.29
2396
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Ζεῦ μέγιστε , αἰτοῦμαί σε , δὸς τοὺς ἐμὲ τιμῶντας νικῆσαί με εὖ ποιοῦντα .
Hear me, I beseech thee, O Zeus almighty, and grant that in service to them I may surpass the honour they show to me.


5.1.30
2397
ἐκ τούτου ἐκέλευσε τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους φυλακὰς καταστήσαντας ἀμφ’ αὑτοὺς ἤδη ἔχειν , τοὺς δὲ Πέρσας διαλαβεῖν τὰς σκηνάς , τοῖς μὲν ἱππεῦσι τὰς τούτοις πρεπούσας , τοῖς δὲ πεζοῖς τὰς τούτοις ἀρκούσας ·
Thereupon he commanded the rest to station guards and after that to do for themselves whatever they pleased;


5.1.30
2398
καὶ οὕτω καταστήσασθαι ὅπως ποιοῦντες οἱ ἐν ταῖς σκηναῖς πάντα τὰ δέοντα φέρωσιν εἰς τὰς τάξεις τοῖς Πέρσαις καὶ τοὺς ἵππους τεθεραπευμένους παρέχωσι , Πέρσαις δὲ μηδὲν ἄλλο ᾖ ἔργον ἢ τὰ πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον ἐκπονεῖν .
and the Persians he bade divide the tents among themselves — to the cavalry the ones appropriate to their use and to the infantry such as sufficed for their needs — and to arrange matters so that the commissaries in the tents should do all that was required of them, prepare everything necessary, and carry it to the quarters of the Persians, and have their horses groomed and fed, and that the Persians should have no duty other than to practise the arts of war.


5.1.30
2399
ταύτην μὲν οὖν οὕτω διῆγον τὴν ἡμέραν .
Thus they spent that day.


5.2.1
2400
πρῲ δ’ ἀναστάντες ἐπορεύοντο πρὸς Γωβρύαν , Κῦρος μὲν ἐφ’ ἵππου καὶ οἱ Περσῶν ἱππεῖς γεγενημένοι εἰς δισχιλίους ·
Rising early the next morning they started —


5.2.1
2401
οἱ δὲ τὰ τούτων γέρρα καὶ τὰς κοπίδας ἔχοντες ἐπὶ τούτοις εἵποντο , ἴσοι ὄντες τὸν ἀριθμόν ·
Cyrus, on horseback, with those of the Persians who had been transformed into cavalrymen, to the number of about two thousand —


5.2.1
2402
καὶ ἡ ἄλλη δὲ στρατιὰ τεταγμένη ἐπορεύετο .
and those who carried the horsemen’s shields and sabres followed behind them, to the same number; the rest of the army also proceeded in its proper divisions.


5.2.1
2403
ἕκαστον δ’ ἐκέλευσε τοῖς καινοῖς αὑτῶν θεράπουσιν εἰπεῖν ὅτι ὅστις ἂν αὐτῶν ἢ τῶν ὀπισθοφυλάκων φαίνηται ὄπισθεν ἢ τοῦ μετώπου πρόσθεν ἴῃ ἢ κατὰ τὰ πλάγια ἔξω τῶν ἐν τάξει ἰόντων ἁλίσκηται , κολασθήσεται .
He ordered the horsemen, each one, to inform their new squires that if any one of them should be seen behind the rear-guard or get in front of the van or be found on the flanks outside the line of march, he should be punished.


5.2.2
2404
δευτεραῖοι δὲ ἀμφὶ δείλην γίγνονται πρὸς τῷ Γωβρύα χωρίῳ , καὶ ὁρῶσιν ὑπερίσχυρόν τε τὸ ἔρυμα καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τειχῶν πάντα παρεσκευασμένα ὡς ἂν κράτιστα ἀπομάχοιτο ·
Toward evening of the second day they arrived at Gobryas’s castle;


5.2.2
2405
καὶ βοῦς δὲ πολλοὺς καὶ πάμπολλα πρόβατα ὑπὸ τὰ ἐρυμνὰ προσηγμένα ἑώρων .
and they saw that the fortress was exceedingly strong and that everything was ready on the walls so that there might be most effective fighting from them. And they saw many cattle also and a great many sheep driven up under protection of the fortifications.


5.2.3
2406
πέμψας δ’ ὁ Γωβρύας πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον ἐκέλευσε περιελάσαντα ἰδεῖν ᾗ ἡ πρόσοδος εὐπετεστάτη , εἴσω δὲ πέμψαι πρὸς ἑαυτὸν τῶν πιστῶν τινας , οἵτινες αὐτῷ τὰ ἔνδον ἰδόντες ἀπαγγελοῦσιν .
Then Gobryas sent to Cyrus  and bade him ride around and see where access was most easy and send in some of his trusted officers to examine what was inside and report back to him what they saw.


5.2.4
2407
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κῦρος αὐτὸς μὲν τῷ ὄντι βουλόμενος ἰδεῖν εἴ που εἴη αἱρέσιμον τὸ τεῖχος , εἰ ψευδὴς φαίνοιτο ὁ Γωβρύας , περιήλαυνε πάντοθεν , ἑώρα τε ἰσχυρότερα πάντα ἢ προσελθεῖν ·
So Cyrus, wishing, as a matter of fact, to see for himself whether the fort could be stormed in case Gobryas should prove false, rode round on every side and saw that it was everywhere too strong for any one to approach.


5.2.4
2408
οὓς δ’ ἔπεμψε πρὸς Γωβρύαν , ἀπήγγελλον τῷ Κύρῳ ὅτι τοσαῦτα εἴη ἔνδον ἀγαθὰ ὅσα ἐπ’ ἀνθρώπων γενεάν , ὡς σφίσι δοκεῖν , μὴ ἂν ἐπιλιπεῖν τοὺς ἔνδον ὄντας .
And those whom he had sent in to Gobryas brought back the report that there were provisions enough inside to last the garrison, as it seemed to them, for a whole generation.


5.2.5
2409
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κῦρος ἐν φροντίδι ἦν ὅ τι ποτ’ εἴη ταῦτα , ὁ δὲ Γωβρύας αὐτός τε ἐξῄει πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς ἔνδοθεν πάντας ἐξῆγε φέροντας οἶνον , ἄλφιτα , ἄλευρα , ἄλλους δ’ ἐλαύνοντας βοῦς , αἶγας , οἶς , σῦς , καὶ εἴ τι βρωτόν , πάντα ἱκανὰ προσῆγον ὡς δειπνῆσαι πᾶσαν τὴν σὺν Κύρῳ στρατιάν .
Now Cyrus  was pondering what all this meant, when Gobryas himself came out bringing with him all his followers; and some of them brought out with them wine and flour and barley-meal; others brought cattle, goats, sheep, swine, and all kinds of provisions — a plenty of everything for a dinner for Cyrus’s whole army.


5.2.6
2410
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἐπὶ τούτῳ ταχθέντες διῄρουν τε ταῦτα καὶ ἐδειπνοποίουν .
And they whose business it was apportioned it and set about preparing the meal.


5.2.6
2411
ὁ δὲ Γωβρύας , ἐπεὶ πάντες αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες ἔξω ἦσαν , εἰσιέναι τὸν Κῦρον ἐκέλευσεν ὅπως νομίζοι ἀσφαλέστατα .
And when all his men were outside, Gobryas bade Cyrus enter, in whatever way he thought he might enter most safely.


5.2.6
2412
προεισπέμψας οὖν ὁ Κῦρος προσκόπους καὶ δύναμιν καὶ αὐτὸς οὕτως εἰσῄει .
So Cyrus sent in ahead of him some scouts and a part of his forces, and then with this precaution he went in himself.


5.2.6
2413
ἐπεὶ δ’ εἰσῆλθεν ἀναπεπταμένας ἔχων τὰς πύλας , παρεκάλει πάντας τοὺς φίλους καὶ ἄρχοντας τῶν μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ .
And when he had gone in, keeping the gates wide open, he called to him all his friends and the officers of the troops with him.


5.2.7
2414
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἔνδον ἦσαν , ἐκφέρων ὁ Γωβρύας φιάλας χρυσᾶς καὶ πρόχους καὶ κάλπιδας καὶ κόσμον παντοῖον καὶ δαρεικοὺς ἀμέτρους τινὰς καὶ πάντα καλὰ πολλά , τέλος τὴν θυγατέρα , δεινόν τι κάλλος καὶ μέγεθος , πενθικῶς δ’ ἔχουσαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τεθνηκότος , ἐξάγων ὧδ’ εἶπεν ·
And when they were inside, Gobryas brought out golden goblets, pitchers, and vases, all sorts of ornaments, an almost countless pile of darics, and all sorts of treasure in great quantities;


5.2.7
2415
ἐγώ σοι , ὦ Κῦρε , τὰ μὲν χρήματα ταῦτα δωροῦμαι , τὴν δὲ θυγατέρα ταύτην ἐπιτρέπω διαθέσθαι ὅπως ἂν σὺ βούλῃ ·
and finally he brought out his daughter, a marvel of beauty and stature, but in mourning for her brother who was dead; and he said:


5.2.7
2416
ἱκετεύομεν δέ , ἐγὼ μὲν καὶ πρόσθεν τοῦ υἱοῦ , αὕτη δὲ νῦν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τιμωρὸν γενέσθαι σε .
These treasures, Cyrus, I present to you, and this my daughter I entrust to you to make what disposal of her you may see fit. But we make our prayer to you, I, as I have done already, that you avenge my son, and she that you be the avenger of her brother.


5.2.8
2417
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος πρὸς ταῦτα εἶπεν ·
Well said Cyrus in reply to this,


5.2.8
2418
ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ σοὶ μὲν καὶ τότε ὑπεσχόμην ἀψευδοῦντός σου τιμωρήσειν εἰς δύναμιν ·
I promised you even then that, assuming that you did not speak me false, I should do all in my power to avenge you;


5.2.8
2419
νῦν δὲ ὅτε ἀληθεύοντά σε ὁρῶ , ἤδη ὀφείλω τὴν ὑπόσχεσιν , καὶ ταύτῃ ὑπισχνοῦμαι τὰ αὐτὰ ταῦτα σὺν θεοῖς ποιήσειν .
and now, when I see that you are truthful, my promise is already due; and I promise her likewise that with heaven’s help I will fulfil my promise to the letter.


5.2.8
2420
καὶ τὰ μὲν χρήματα ταῦτα , ἔφη , ἐγὼ μὲν δέχομαι , δίδωμι δ’ αὐτὰ τῇ παιδὶ ταύτῃ κ- ἐκείνῳ ὃς ἂν γήμῃ αὐτήν .
Now as to these treasures, said he, I accept them, but I give them again to your daughter here and the man who shall marry her.


5.2.8
2421
ἓν δὲ δῶρον ἄπειμι ἔχων παρὰ σοῦ ἀνθ’ οὗ οὐδ’ ἂν τὰ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι , εἰ ἐκεῖ πλεῖστά ἐστιν , οὐδὲ τὰ πανταχοῦ ἀντὶ τούτου οὗ σύ μοι δεδώρησαι ἥδιον ἂν ἔχων ἀπέλθοιμι .
But one gift of yours will I take as I leave you, in place of which not even all the wealth of Babylon (and that is enormous) — no, not even all the wealth of all the world would send me away more happy than with this gift from you.


5.2.9
2422
καὶ ὁ Γωβρύας θαυμάσας τε τί τοῦτ’ εἴη καὶ ὑποπτεύσας μὴ τὴν θυγατέρα λέγοι , οὕτως ἤρετο ·
And Gobryas, wondering what he meant and suspecting that he meant his daughter, asked:


5.2.9
2423
καὶ τί τοῦτ’ ἔστιν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε ;
And what might that gift be, Cyrus?


5.2.9
2424
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἀπεκρίνατο ·
Gobryas, he replied, it is this:


5.2.9
2425
ὅτι , ἔφη , ἐγώ , ὦ Γωβρύα , πολλοὺς μὲν οἶμαι εἶναι ἀνθρώπους οἳ οὔτε ἀσεβεῖν ἂν θέλοιεν οὔτε ἀδικεῖν οὔτε ἂν ψεύδοιντο ἑκόντες εἶναι ·
I believe that there are many men who would not consent to be wicked or unjust or false, but they die before it is ever discovered what sort of men they are,


5.2.9
2426
διὰ δὲ τὸ μηδένα αὐτοῖς ἠθεληκέναι προέσθαι μήτε χρήματα πολλὰ μήτε τυραννίδα μήτε τείχη ἐρυμνὰ μήτε τέκνα ἀξιέραστα , ἀποθνῄσκουσι πρότερον πρὶν δῆλοι γενέσθαι οἷοι ἦσαν ·
simply because no one has ever seen fit to entrust them with great wealth or kingly power or mighty fortresses or lovely children;


5.2.10
2427
ἐμοὶ δὲ σὺ νυνὶ καὶ τείχη ἐρυμνὰ καὶ πλοῦτον παντοδαπὸν καὶ δύναμιν τὴν σὴν καὶ θυγατέρα ἀξιόκτητον ἐγχειρίσας πεποίηκάς με δῆλον γενέσθαι πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ὅτι οὔτ’ ἂν ἀσεβεῖν περὶ ξένους θέλοιμι οὔτ’ ἂν ἀδικεῖν χρημάτων ἕνεκα οὔτε συνθήκας ἂν ψευδοίμην ἑκὼν εἶναι .
but you have now placed in my hands your fortress and all sorts of wealth, your forces and your precious child, and have thus given me an opportunity of showing to all the world that I would not do an act of wickedness against a friend or do a wrong for the sake of gain or willingly prove false to a covenant.


5.2.11
2428
τούτων ἐγώ , εὖ ἴσθι , ἕως ἂν ἀνὴρ δίκαιος ὦ καὶ δοκῶν εἶναι τοιοῦτος ἐπαινῶμαι ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων , οὔποτ’ ἐπιλήσομαι , ἀλλὰ πειράσομαί σε ἀντιτιμῆσαι πᾶσι τοῖς καλοῖς .
And so long as I am an honest man and receive men’s approbation as bearing this reputation, I assure you that I shall never forget this proof of your confidence but shall try to show you all fair honour in return.


5.2.12
2429
καὶ ἀνδρὸς δ’ , ἔφη , τῇ θυγατρὶ μὴ φοβοῦ ὡς ἀπορήσεις ἀξίου ταύτης ·
And as for your daughter, he continued, do not fear that you shall fail to find a husband worthy of her;


5.2.12
2430
πολλοὶ γὰρ καὶ ἀγαθοὶ φίλοι εἰσὶν ἐμοί ·
for I have many noble friends;


5.2.12
2431
ὧν τις γαμεῖ ταύτην ·
some one of them will marry her.


5.2.12
2432
εἰ μέντοι χρήμαθ’ ἕξει τοσαῦτα ὅσα σὺ δίδως ἢ καὶ ἄλλα πολλαπλάσια τούτων , οὐκ ἂν ἔχοιμι εἰπεῖν ·
But whether he will have as much money as you are ready to give me or even many times as much, I could not say.


5.2.12
2433
σὺ μέντοι εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι εἰσί τινες αὐτῶν οἳ ὧν μὲν σὺ δίδως χρημάτων οὐδὲ μικρὸν τούτων ἕνεκά σε μᾶλλον θαυμάζουσιν ·
Let me tell you, however, that there are some of them who do not admire you one whit the more for the money you have to offer;


5.2.12
2434
ἐμὲ δὲ ζηλοῦσι νυνὶ καὶ εὔχονται πᾶσι θεοῖς γενέσθαι ποτὲ ἐπιδείξασθαι ὡς πιστοὶ μέν εἰσιν οὐδὲν ἧττον ἐμοῦ τοῖς φίλοις , τοῖς δὲ πολεμίοις ὡς οὔποτ’ ἂν ὑφεῖντο ζῶντες , εἰ μή τις θεὸς βλάπτοι ·
but with me they are vying now and praying to all the gods that it may be granted them one day to prove that they are not less faithful to their friends than I, and that so long as they live they would never yield to their enemies, unless some god should cross them.


5.2.12
2435
ἀντὶ δ’ ἀρετῆς καὶ δόξης ἀγαθῆς ὅτι οὐδ’ ἂν τὰ Σύρων πρὸς τοῖς σοῖς καὶ Ἀσσυρίων πάντα προέλοιντο ·
But their virtue and their good name they would not barter for all your wealth and the wealth of the Assyrians and Syrians to boot.


5.2.12
2436
τοιούτους ἄνδρας εὖ ἴσθι ἐνταῦθα καθημένους .
Such men, let me tell you, are sitting here.


5.2.13
2437
καὶ ὁ Γωβρύας εἶπε γελάσας ·
By the gods, Cyrus, said Gobryas with a laugh,


5.2.13
2438
πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , δεῖξον δή μοι ποῦ οὗτοί εἰσιν , ἵνα σε τούτων τινὰ αἰτήσωμαι παῖδά μοι γενέσθαι .
please show me where they are, that I may ask you for one of them to be my son-in-law.


5.2.13
2439
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
There will be no need of your getting that information from me, answered Cyrus;


5.2.13
2440
ἀμέλει , ἔφη , οὐδὲν ἐμοῦ σε δεήσει πυνθάνεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἂν σὺν ἡμῖν ἕπῃ , αὐτὸς σὺ ἕξεις καὶ ἄλλῳ δεικνύναι αὐτῶν ἕκαστον .
but, if you will go with us, you will be able yourself to point each one of them out to somebody else.


5.2.14
2441
τοσαῦτ’ εἰπὼν δεξιάν τε λαβὼν τοῦ Γωβρύα καὶ ἀναστὰς ἐξῄει , καὶ τοὺς μεθ’ αὑτοῦ ἐξῆγεν ἅπαντας ·
When he had thus spoken, he clasped Gobryas’s right hand in his and rose to depart, taking with him all his followers.


5.2.14
2442
καὶ πολλὰ δεομένου τοῦ Γωβρύα ἔνδον δειπνεῖν οὐκ ἠθέλησεν , ἀλλ’ ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ ἐδείπνει καὶ τὸν Γωβρύαν σύνδειπνον παρέλαβεν .
And though Gobryas urged him to dine in the castle, he declined, but dined in camp and took Gobryas with him as his guest.


5.2.15
2443
ἐπὶ στιβάδος δὲ κατακλινεὶς ἤρετο αὐτὸν ὧδε ·
And as he reclined upon a mat of straw he asked this question:


5.2.15
2444
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Γωβρύα , πότερον οἴει σοὶ εἶναι πλείω ἢ ἑκάστῳ ἡμῶν στρώματα ;
Tell me, Gobryas, do you think you have more coverlets than each one of us?


5.2.15
2445
καὶ ὃς εἶπεν ·
The other answered:


5.2.15
2446
ὑμῖν νὴ Δί’ εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι , ἔφη , καὶ στρώματα πλείω ἐστὶ καὶ κλῖναι , καὶ οἰκία γε πολὺ μείζων ἡ ὑμετέρα τῆς ἐμῆς , οἵ γε οἰκίᾳ μὲν χρῆσθε γῇ τε καὶ οὐρανῷ , κλῖναι δ’ ὑμῖν εἰσιν ὁπόσαι εὐναὶ γένοιντ’ ἂν ἐπὶ γῆς ·
I am perfectly sure, by Zeus, he said, that you have more coverlets and more couches, and that your dwelling is much larger than mine;


5.2.15
2447
στρώματα δὲ νομίζετε οὐχ ὅσα πρόβατα φύει , ἀλλ’ ὅσα ὄρη τε καὶ πεδία ἀνίησι .
for you take heaven and earth for your dwelling, and you have as many couches as you can find resting-places on the ground, while you regard as your proper coverlets not wool that sheep produce, but whatever the mountains and plains bring forth.


5.2.16
2448
τὸ μὲν δὴ πρῶτον συνδειπνῶν αὐτοῖς ὁ Γωβρύας καὶ ὁρῶν τὴν φαυλότητα τῶν παρατιθεμένων βρωμάτων πολὺ σφᾶς ἐνόμιζεν ἐλευθεριωτέρους εἶναι αὐτῶν ·
Thus, as Gobryas dined with them for the first time and saw the simplicity of the food set before them, he thought his own people more refined than they.


5.2.17
2449
ἐπεὶ δὲ κατενόησε τὴν μετριότητα τῶν συσσίτων ·
But he soon perceived the temperance of the soldiers who sat at meat with him;


5.2.17
2450
ἐπ’ οὐδενὶ γὰρ βρώματι οὐδὲ πώματι Πέρσης ἀνὴρ τῶν πεπαιδευμένων οὔτ’ ἂν ὄμμασιν ἐκπεπληγμένος καταφανὴς γένοιτο οὔτε ἁρπαγῇ οὔτε τῷ νῷ μὴ οὐχὶ προσκοπεῖν ἅπερ ἂν καὶ μὴ ἐπὶ σίτῳ ὤν ·
for no Persian of the educated class would allow it to appear that he was captivated with any kind of food or drink, either with his eyes gloating over it, or with his hands greedy to get it, or with his thoughts so engrossed by it as to fail to observe things that would attract his attention if he were not at meat;


5.2.17
2451
ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ οἱ ἱππικοὶ διὰ τὸ μὴ ταράττεσθαι ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων δύνανται ἅμα ἱππεύοντες καὶ ὁρᾶν καὶ ἀκούειν καὶ λέγειν τὸ δέον , οὕτω κ- ἐκεῖνοι ἐν τῷ σίτῳ οἴονται δεῖν φρόνιμοι καὶ μέτριοι φαίνεσθαι ·
but just as good horsemen do not lose their self-command when on horseback but can ride along and at the same time see and hear and say whatever they should, so also the educated Persians think that at their meals they ought to show themselves sensible and temperate;


5.2.17
2452
τὸ δὲ κεκινῆσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν βρωμάτων καὶ τῆς πόσεως πάνυ αὐτοῖς ὑικὸν καὶ θηριῶδες δοκεῖ εἶναι ·
and to become excited over food or drink seems to them altogether swinish and bestial.


5.2.18
2453
ἐνενόησε δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ ὡς ἐπηρώτων τε ἀλλήλους τοιαῦτα οἷα ἐρωτηθῆναι ἥδιον ἢ μὴ καὶ ἔσκωπτον οἷα σκωφθῆναι ἥδιον ἢ μή ·
He noticed further about them that they asked one another such questions as people are more pleased to be asked than not, that they indulged in such banter as is more agreeable to hear than not;


5.2.18
2454
ἅ τε ἔπαιζον ὡς πολὺ μὲν ὕβρεως ἀπῆν , πολὺ δὲ τοῦ αἰσχρόν τι ποιεῖν , πολὺ δὲ τοῦ χαλεπαίνεσθαι πρὸς ἀλλήλους ·
he observed how far their jests were removed from insult, how far they were from doing anything unbecoming, and how far from offending one another.


5.2.19
2455
μέγιστον δ’ αὐτῷ ἔδοξεν εἶναι τὸ ἐν στρατείᾳ ὄντας τῶν εἰς τὸν αὐτὸν κίνδυνον ἐμβαινόντων μηδενὸς οἴεσθαι δεῖν πλείω παρατίθεσθαι , ἀλλὰ τοῦτο νομίζειν ἡδίστην εὐωχίαν εἶναι τοὺς συμμάχεσθαι μέλλοντας ὅτι βελτίστους παρασκευάζειν ·
But what seemed to him most extraordinary of all was that when on active service they did not think they ought to be served with a larger share than any one else of those who were going into the same dangers, but that they considered it the most sumptuous feast to make those who were to be their comrades in arms as efficient as possible.


5.2.20
2456
ἡνίκα δὲ Γωβρύας ὡς εἰς οἶκον ἀπιὼν ἀνίστατο , εἰπεῖν λέγεται ·
When Gobryas rose to go home, he is reported to have said:


5.2.20
2457
οὐκέτι θαυμάζω , ὦ Κῦρε , εἰ ἐκπώματα μὲν καὶ ἱμάτια καὶ χρυσίον ἡμεῖς ὑμῶν πλέονα κεκτήμεθα , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐλάττονος ὑμῶν ἄξιοί ἐσμεν .
I am no longer surprised, Cyrus, that while we possess more cups and clothing and gold than you, we ourselves are worth less than you are.


5.2.20
2458
ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ἐπιμελούμεθα ὅπως ἡμῖν ταῦτα ὡς πλεῖστα ἔσται , ὑμεῖς δέ μοι δοκεῖτε ἐπιμέλεσθαι ὅπως αὐτοὶ ὡς βέλτιστοι ἔσεσθε .
For our whole thought is to have as much of those things as possible, while your whole thought seems to me to be that you may be yourselves as capable as possible.


5.2.20
2459
ὁ μὲν ταῦτ’ εἶπεν ·
This was what he said.


5.2.21
2460
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος , ἄγ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Γωβρύα , ὅπως πρῲ παρέσῃ ἔχων τοὺς ἱππέας ἐξωπλισμένους , ἵνα καὶ τὴν δύναμίν σου ἴδωμεν , καὶ ἅμα διὰ τῆς σῆς χώρας ἄξεις ἡμᾶς , ὅπως ἂν εἰδῶμεν ἅ τε δεῖ φίλια καὶ πολέμια ἡμᾶς νομίζειν .
Thus he spoke; and Cyrus  answered:  Please see to it, Gobryas, that you are here early in the morning with your cavalry under arms, so that we may see your forces, and then you shall lead us through your country so that we may know what we have to consider as belonging to our friends and what as belonging to our enemies.


5.2.22
2461
τότε μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ εἰπόντες ἀπῆλθον ἑκάτερος ἐπὶ τὰ προσήκοντα .
When they had thus spoken, they went away, each to his own proper task.


5.2.22
2462
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο , παρῆν ὁ Γωβρύας ἔχων τοὺς ἱππέας , καὶ ἡγεῖτο .
When day dawned, Gobryas came with his cavalry and led the way.


5.2.22
2463
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος , ὥσπερ προσήκει ἀνδρὶ ἄρχοντι , οὐ μόνον τῷ πορεύεσθαι τὴν ὁδὸν προσεῖχε τὸν νοῦν , ἀλλ’ ἅμα προϊὼν ἐπεσκοπεῖτο εἴ τι δυνατὸν εἴη τοὺς πολεμίους ἀσθενεστέρους ποιεῖν ἢ αὑτοὺς ἰσχυροτέρους .
But Cyrus, as became a general, turned his thoughts not only upon the march, but at the same time, as he proceeded, he kept studying the situation to see whether it might be in any way possible to make the enemy weaker or his own side stronger.


5.2.23
2464
καλέσας οὖν τὸν Ὑρκάνιον καὶ τὸν Γωβρύαν ( τούτους γὰρ ἐνόμιζεν εἰδέναι μάλιστα ὧν αὐτὸς ᾤετο δεῖσθαι μαθεῖν ) , ἐγώ τοι , ἔφη , ὦ ἄνδρες φίλοι , οἶμαι σὺν ὑμῖν ἂν ὡς πιστοῖς βουλευόμενος περὶ τοῦ πολέμου τοῦδε οὐκ ἂν ἐξαμαρτάνειν ·
So he called Gobryas and the Hyrcanian king to him, for he supposed that they must know best what he thought he needed to learn, and said:


5.2.23
2465
ὁρῶ γὰρ ὅτι μᾶλλον ὑμῖν ἢ ἐμοὶ σκεπτέον ὅπως ὁ Ἀσσύριος ἡμῶν μὴ ἐπικρατήσει .
My dear friends, I think that I should be making no mistake to consult with you in regard to this war and to rely upon your trustworthiness.


5.2.23
2466
ἐμοὶ μὲν γάρ , ἔφη , τῶνδε ἀποσφαλέντι ἔστιν ἴσως καὶ ἄλλη ἀποστροφή ·
For I observe that you have greater need than I to see to it that the Assyrian shall not get the upper hand of us: if I am unsuccessful in this, I shall, perhaps, find some other place of refuge;


5.2.23
2467
ὑμῖν δ’ , εἰ οὗτος ἐπικρατήσει , ὁρῶ ἅμα πάντα τὰ ὄντα ἀλλότρια γιγνόμενα .
whereas in your case, I see that if he gains the upper hand, all that you have passes into other hands.


5.2.24
2468
καὶ γὰρ ἐμοὶ μὲν πολέμιός ἐστιν , οὐκ ἐμὲ μισῶν , ἀλλ’ οἰόμενος ἀσύμφορον αὑτῷ μεγάλους εἶναι ἡμᾶς , καὶ στρατεύει διὰ τοῦτο ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς ·
For, as for me, he is my enemy, not because he hates me, but because he imagines that it would be inimical to his interests for our nation to become great, and for that reason he is making war upon us;


5.2.24
2469
ὑμᾶς δὲ καὶ μισεῖ , ἀδικεῖσθαι νομίζων ὑφ’ ὑμῶν .
but you he actually hates, for he thinks that you have done him wrong.


5.2.24
2470
πρὸς ταῦτα ἀπεκρίναντο ἀμφότεροι κατὰ τ- αὐτά , περαίνειν ὅ τι μέλλει ὡς ταῦτ’ εἰδόσι σφίσι καὶ μέλον αὐτοῖς ἰσχυρῶς ὅπῃ τὸ μέλλον ἀποβήσοιτο .
To this they both answered in the same way, that he should proceed with what he had to say, for they recognized the truth of what he had said and knew that it was a matter of vital concern to them how things turned out in the future.


5.2.25
2471
ἐνταῦθα δὴ ἤρξατο ὧδε ·
Then he began as follows:


5.2.25
2472
λέξατε δή μοι , ἔφη , ὑμᾶς νομίζει μόνους πολεμικῶς ἔχειν ὁ Ἀσσύριος πρὸς ἑαυτόν , ἢ ἐπίστασθε καὶ ἄλλον τινὰ αὐτῷ πολέμιον ;
Tell me, then, said he, does the Assyrian king believe that you are the only ones who are hostile to him, or do you know of any one else who is his enemy?


5.2.25
2473
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὁ Ὑρκάνιος , πολεμιώτατοι μέν εἰσιν αὐτῷ Καδούσιοι , ἔθνος πολύ τε καὶ ἄλκιμον ·
Yes, by Zeus, said the Hyrcanian; the Cadusians, a large and powerful nation, are most bitter enemies of his;


5.2.25
2474
Σάκαι γε μὴν ὅμοροι ἡμῖν , οἳ κακὰ πολλὰ πεπόνθασιν ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου ·
and so are our neighbours, the Sacians, for they have suffered very severely at his hands;


5.2.25
2475
ἐπειρᾶτο γὰρ κ- ἐκείνους ὥσπερ καὶ ἡμᾶς καταστρέψασθαι .
for he attempted to subjugate them just as he did us.


5.2.26
2476
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , οἴεσθε νῦν αὐτοὺς ἀμφοτέρους ἡδέως ἂν ἐπιβῆναι μεθ’ ἡμῶν τῷ Ἀσσυρίῳ ;
Well then, said he, do you think that these two nations would like to join us in an attack upon the Assyrian?


5.2.26
2477
ἔφασαν καὶ σφόδρ’ ἄν , εἴ πῄ γε δύναιντο συμμεῖξαι .
Yes, they answered, and right eagerly, if they could find a way to combine their forces with ours.


5.2.26
2478
τί δ’ , ἔφη , ἐν μέσῳ ἐστὶ τοῦ συμμεῖξαι ;
And what is to hinder such a union of forces? asked Cyrus.


5.2.26
2479
Ἀσσύριοι , ἔφασαν , τὸ αὐτὸ ἔθνος δι’ οὗπερ νυνὶ πορεύῃ .
The Assyrians, they answered, the same nation, through whose country you are now marching.


5.2.27
2480
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα ἤκουσεν ὁ Κῦρος , τί γάρ , ἔφη , ὦ Γωβρύα , οὐ σὺ τοῦ νεανίσκου τούτου ὃς νῦν εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν καθέστηκεν ὑπερηφανίαν πολλήν τινα τοῦ τρόπου κατηγόρεις ;
But, Gobryas, said Cyrus, when he heard this, do you not accuse this young fellow who has just come to the throne of cruel insolence of character?


5.2.27
2481
τοιαῦτα γάρ , οἶμαι , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , ἔπαθον ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ .
That judgment, I think, said Gobryas, is warranted by my experience with him.


5.2.27
2482
πότερα δῆτα , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , εἰς σὲ μόνον τοιοῦτος ἐγένετο ἢ καὶ εἰς ἄλλους τινάς ;
Pray, are you the only man towards whom he has acted in this way, Cyrus asked, or are there others also?


5.2.28
2483
νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , καὶ εἰς ἄλλους γε πολλούς ·
Aye, by Zeus, said Gobryas; there are others also.


5.2.28
2484
ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὲν ἀσθενοῦντας οἷα ὑβρίζει τί δεῖ λέγειν ;
But why should I recount his acts of insolence toward the weak?


5.2.28
2485
ἑνὸς δὲ ἀνδρὸς πολὺ δυνατωτέρου ἢ ἐγὼ υἱόν , καὶ ἐκείνου ἑταῖρον ὄντα ὥσπερ τὸν ἐμόν , συμπίνοντα παρ’ ἑαυτῷ συλλαβὼν ἐξέτεμεν , ὡς μέν τινες ἔφασαν , ὅτι ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ ἐπῄνεσεν αὐτὸν ὡς καλὸς εἴη καὶ ἐμακάρισε τὴν μέλλουσαν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα ἔσεσθαι ·
For once when he and the son of a man much more powerful than I were drinking together, a young man who, like my son, was his comrade, he had him seized and castrated; and the occasion, so some people said, was simply because his concubine had praised his friend, remarking how handsome he was and felicitating the woman who should be his wife;


5.2.28
2486
ὡς δ’ αὐτὸς νῦν λέγει , ὅτι ἐπείρασεν αὐτοῦ τὴν παλλακίδα .
but the king himself now maintains that it was because the man had made advances toward his concubine.


5.2.28
2487
καὶ νῦν οὗτος εὐνοῦχος μέν ἐστι , τὴν δ’ ἀρχὴν ἔχει , ἐπεὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐτελεύτησεν .
And so now he is a eunuch, but he has come into the kingdom, for his father is dead.


5.2.29
2488
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , οἴει ἂν καὶ τοῦτον ἡδέως ἡμᾶς ἰδεῖν , εἰ οἴοιτο αὑτῷ βοηθοὺς ἂν γενέσθαι ;
Well then, said Cyrus, do you think that he also would be glad to see us, if he thought we could help him?


5.2.29
2489
εὖ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη , οἶδα , ὁ Γωβρύας ·
Think, said Gobryas, I am sure of it.


5.2.29
2490
ἀλλ’ ἰδεῖν τοι αὐτὸν χαλεπόν ἐστιν , ὦ Κῦρε .
But, Cyrus, it would be difficult to see him.


5.2.29
2491
πῶς ;
Why?


5.2.29
2492
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
asked Cyrus.


5.2.29
2493
ὅτι εἰ μέλλει τις ἐκείνῳ συμμείξειν , παρ’ αὐτὴν τὴν Βαβυλῶνα δεῖ παριέναι .
Because, to effect a union of forces with him, one has to march along under the very walls of Babylon.


5.2.30
2494
τί οὖν , ἔφη , τοῦτο χαλεπόν ;
Why, pray, said the other, is that so difficult?


5.2.30
2495
ὅτι νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , οἶδα ἐξελθοῦσαν ἂν δύναμιν ἐξ αὐτῆς πολλαπλασίαν ἧς σὺ ἔχεις νῦν ·
Because, by Zeus, said Gobryas, I know that the forces that would come out of that city alone are many times as large as your own at present;


5.2.30
2496
εὖ δ’ ἴσθι ὅτι καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἧττόν σοι νῦν ἢ τὸ πρότερον Ἀσσύριοι καὶ τὰ ὅπλα ἀποφέρουσι καὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἀπάγουσιν , ὅτι τοῖς ἰδοῦσιν αὐτῶν ὀλίγη ἔδοξεν εἶναι ἡ σὴ δύναμις ·
and let me tell you that the Assyrians are now less inclined than heretofore to deliver up their arms and to bring in their horses to you for the very reason that to those of them who have seen your army it seemed a small one;


5.2.30
2497
καὶ ὁ λόγος οὗτος πολὺς ἤδη ἔσπαρται ·
and a rumour to this effect has now been widely spread abroad.


5.2.30
2498
δοκεῖ δέ μοι , ἔφη , βέλτιον εἶναι φυλαττομένους πορεύεσθαι .
And, he added, I think we should do better to proceed cautiously.


5.2.31
2499
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἀκούσας τοῦ Γωβρύα τοιαῦτα τοιάδε πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔλεξε .
Cyrus made answer upon hearing this suggestion from him.


5.2.31
2500
καλῶς μοι δοκεῖς λέγειν , ὦ Γωβρύα , κελεύων ὡς ἀσφαλέστατα τὰς πορείας ποιεῖσθαι .
I think you are right, Gobryas, in admonishing us to march with the utmost caution,


5.2.31
2501
ἔγωγ’ οὖν σκοπῶν οὐ δύναμαι ἐννοῆσαι ἀσφαλεστέραν οὐδεμίαν πορείαν ἡμῖν τῆς πρὸς αὐτὴν Βαβυλῶνα εἶναι , εἰ ἐκεῖ τῶν πολεμίων ἐστὶ τὸ κράτιστον .
But when I think of it, I cannot conceive of any safer procedure for us than to march directly upon Babylon, if that is where the main body of the enemy’s forces is.


5.2.31
2502
πολλοὶ μὲν γάρ εἰσιν , ὡς σὺ φῄς ·
For they are, as you say, numerous;


5.2.31
2503
εἰ δὲ θαρρήσουσι , καὶ δεινοὶ ἡμῖν , ὡς ἐγώ φημι , ἔσονται .
and if they take courage, they will also, as I say, give us cause to fear them. However, if they do not see us and get the idea that we are keeping out of sight because we are afraid of them, then, let me assure you, they will recover from the fear with which we inspired them;and the longer we keep out of their sight, the greater the courage that will spring up within them in place of that fear.


5.2.32
2504
μὴ ὁρῶντες μὲν οὖν ἡμᾶς , ἀλλ’ οἰόμενοι ἀφανεῖς εἶναι διὰ τὸ φοβεῖσθαι ἐκείνους , σάφ’ ἴσθι , ἔφη , ὅτι τοῦ μὲν φόβου ἀπαλλάξονται ὃς αὐτοῖς ἐνεγένετο , θάρρος δ’ ἐμφύσεται ἀντὶ τούτου τοσούτῳ μεῖζον ὅσῳ ἂν πλείονα χρόνον ἡμᾶς μὴ ὁρῶσιν ·
However, if they do not see us and get the idea that we are keeping out of sight because we are afraid of them, then, let me assure you, they will recover from the fear with which we inspired them; and the longer we keep out of their sight, the greater the courage that will spring up within them in place of that fear.


5.2.32
2505
ἢν δὲ ἤδη ἴωμεν ἐπ’ αὐτούς , πολλοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν εὑρήσομεν ἔτι κλαίοντας τοὺς ἀποθανόντας ὑφ’ ἡμῶν , πολλοὺς δ’ ἔτι τραύματα ἐπιδεδεμένους ἃ ὑπὸ τῶν ἡμετέρων ἔλαβον , πάντας δ’ ἔτι μεμνημένους τῆς μὲν τοῦδε τοῦ στρατεύματος τόλμης , τῆς δ’ αὑτῶν φυγῆς τε καὶ συμφορᾶς .
But if we march upon them at once, we shall find many of them still in tears over those whom we have slain, many still wearing bandages on the wounds they received from us, and all still mindful of the daring of this army of ours and of their own flight and defeat.


5.2.33
2506
εὖ δ’ ἴσθι , ἔφη , ὦ Γωβρύα , ἵνα καὶ τοῦτ’ εἰδῇς , οἱ πολλοὶ ἄνθρωποι , ὅταν μὲν θαρρῶσιν , ἀνυπόστατον τὸ φρόνημα παρέχονται ·
And let me assure you, Gobryas, he continued, that your large bodies of men, when they are inspired with confidence, display a spirit that is irresistible;


5.2.33
2507
ὅταν δὲ δείσωσιν , ὅσῳ ἂν πλείους ὦσι , τοσούτῳ μείζω καὶ ἐκπεπληγμένον μᾶλλον τὸν φόβον κέκτηνται .
but when once they are frightened, the greater their numbers are, the greater and more overpowering the panic that seizes them.


5.2.34
2508
ἐκ πολλῶν μὲν γὰρ καὶ κακῶν λόγων ηὐξημένος αὐτοῖς πάρεστιν , ἐκ πολλῶν δὲ καὶ πονηρῶν χρωμάτων , ἐκ πολλῶν δὲ καὶ δυσθύμων τε καὶ ἐξεστηκότων προσώπων ἥθροισται .
For it comes over them increased by the many faint-hearted words they hear and magnified by the many wretched figures and the many dejected and distorted countenances they see;


5.2.34
2509
ὥσθ’ ὑπὸ τοῦ μεγέθους οὐ ῥᾴδιον αὐτόν ἐστιν οὔτε λόγοις κατασβέσαι οὔτε προσάγοντα πολεμίοις μένος ἐμβαλεῖν οὔτε ἀπάγοντα ἀναθρέψαι τὸ φρόνημα , ἀλλ’ ὅσῳ ἂν μᾶλλον αὐτοῖς θαρρεῖν παρακελεύῃ , τοσούτῳ ἐν δεινοτέροις ἡγοῦνται εἶναι .
and by reason of the large numbers it is not easy with a speech to quell the panic, nor by a charge against the enemy to inspire them with courage, nor by a retreat to rally their spirits;


5.2.35
2510
ἐκεῖνο μέντοι νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , σκεψώμεθα ἀκριβῶς ὅπως ἔχει .
but the more you try to encourage them to bravery, in so much the greater peril do they think they are.


5.2.35
2511
εἰ μὲν γὰρ τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε αἱ νῖκαι ἔσονται ἐν τοῖς πολεμικοῖς ἔργοις ὁπότεροι ἂν πλείονα ὄχλον ἀπαριθμήσωσιν , ὀρθῶς καὶ σὺ φοβῇ περὶ ἡμῶν καὶ ἡμεῖς τῷ ὄντι ἐν δεινοῖς ἐσμεν ·
Again, by Zeus, said he, let us consider precisely how this matter stands:


5.2.35
2512
εἰ μέντοι ὥσπερ πρόσθεν διὰ τοὺς εὖ μαχομένους ἔτι καὶ νῦν αἱ μάχαι κρίνονται , θαρρῶν οὐδὲν ἂν σφαλείης ·
if, in future, victory on the field of battle is to rest with that side which counts the greater numbers, you have good reason to fear for us and we really are in danger.


5.2.35
2513
πολὺ μὲν γὰρ σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς πλείονας εὑρήσεις παρ’ ἡμῖν τοὺς θέλοντας μάχεσθαι ἢ παρ’ ἐκείνοις ·
If, however, battles are still to be decided by good fighting as they have been before, it would not be at all amiss for you to be bold and confident;


5.2.36
2514
ὡς δ’ ἔτι μᾶλλον θαρρῇς , καὶ τόδε κατανόησον ·
for, please God, you will find far more men on our side who are eager to fight, than on theirs.


5.2.36
2515
οἱ μὲν γὰρ πολέμιοι πολὺ μὲν ἐλάττονές εἰσι νῦν ἢ πρὶν ἡττηθῆναι ὑφ’ ἡμῶν , πολὺ δ’ ἐλάττονες ἢ ὅτε ἀπέδρασαν ἡμᾶς ·
And to give yourself still more confidence, bethink you also of this: the enemy are much fewer now than they were before we defeated them, much weaker than when they fled before us;


5.2.36
2516
ἡμεῖς δὲ καὶ μείζονες νῦν , ἐπεὶ νενικήκαμεν , καὶ ἰσχυρότεροι , ἐπεὶ ὑμεῖς ἡμῖν προσγεγένησθε ·
while we are bigger now since we have conquered and stronger since you have been added to us.


5.2.36
2517
μὴ γὰρ ἔτι ἀτίμαζε μηδὲ τοὺς σούς , ἐπεὶ σὺν ἡμῖν εἰσι ·
For you must no longer undervalue your own men, now that they are with us;


5.2.36
2518
σὺν γὰρ τοῖς νικῶσι , σάφ’ ἴσθι , ὦ Γωβρύα , θαρροῦντες καὶ οἱ ἀκόλουθοι ἕπονται .
for be assured, Gobryas, that when they are with the victors, even those who follow the camp go along without a fear.


5.2.37
2519
μὴ λανθανέτω δέ σε μηδὲ τοῦτο , ἔφη , ὅτι ἔξεστι μὲν τοῖς πολεμίοις καὶ νῦν ἰδεῖν ἡμᾶς ·
And do not forget this either, that the enemy may find us even now, if they will.


5.2.37
2520
γοργότεροι δέ , σάφ’ ἴσθι , οὐδαμῶς ἂν αὐτοῖς φανείημεν ἢ ἰόντες ἐπ’ ἐκείνους .
And, let me assure you, we could in no possible way strike more terror into them when they do see us, than by marching upon them.


5.2.37
2521
ὡς οὖν ἐμοῦ ταῦτα γιγνώσκοντος ἄγε ἡμᾶς εὐθὺ τὴν ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνος .
As this, therefore, is my conviction, lead us straight on to Babylon.


5.3.1
2522
οὕτω μὲν δὴ πορευόμενοι τεταρταῖοι πρὸς τοῖς ὁρίοις τῆς Γωβρύα χώρας ἐγένοντο .
As they thus proceeded, they arrived on the fourth day at the boundaries of Gobryas’s domains.


5.3.1
2523
ὡς δὲ ἐν τῇ πολεμίᾳ ἦν , κατέστησε λαβὼν ἐν τάξει μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ τούς τε πεζοὺς καὶ τῶν ἱππέων ὅσους ἐδόκει καλῶς αὐτῷ ἔχειν ·
And as soon as Cyrus was in the enemy’s country, he arranged in regular order under his own command the infantry and as much of the cavalry as seemed to him best.


5.3.1
2524
τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους ἱππέας ἀφῆκε καταθεῖν , καὶ ἐκέλευσε τοὺς μὲν ὅπλα ἔχοντας κατακαίνειν , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους καὶ πρόβατα ὅσα ἂν λάβωσι πρὸς αὑτὸν ἄγειν .
The rest of the cavalry he sent out to forage, with orders to kill those who were under arms but to bring every one else to him, as well as any cattle they might take.


5.3.1
2525
ἐκέλευσε δὲ καὶ τοὺς Πέρσας συγκαταθεῖν ·
The Persians he ordered to join the foraging party.


5.3.1
2526
καὶ ἧκον πολλοὶ μὲν αὐτῶν κατακεκυλισμένοι ἀπὸ τῶν ἵππων , πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ λείαν πλείστην ἄγοντες .
And many of them were thrown from their horses and came back, but many of them also came bringing a great quantity of plunder.


5.3.2
2527
ὡς δὲ παρῆν ἡ λεία , συγκαλέσας τούς τε τῶν Μήδων ἄρχοντας καὶ τῶν Ὑρκανίων καὶ τοὺς ὁμοτίμους ἔλεξεν ὧδε .
When all the booty was brought in, he called the peers and the officers of the Medes and Hyrcanians together and addressed them as follows:


5.3.2
2528
ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἐξένισεν ἡμᾶς ἅπαντας πολλοῖς ἀγαθοῖς Γωβρύας .
My friends, Gobryas has entertained us all with great munificence.


5.3.2
2529
εἰ οὖν , ἔφη , τοῖς θεοῖς ἐξελόντες τὰ νομιζόμενα καὶ τῇ στρατιᾷ τὰ ἱκανὰ τὴν ἄλλην τούτῳ δοίημεν λείαν , ἆρ’ ἄν , ἔφη , καλὸν ποιήσαιμεν τῷ εὐθὺς φανεροὶ εἶναι ὅτι καὶ τοὺς εὖ ποιοῦντας πειρώμεθα νικᾶν εὖ ποιοῦντες ;
So, if we should set apart the share of the spoil ordained for the gods and a portion sufficient for the army and give the rest to him, should we not be doing the right thing? For we should be giving immediate proof that we are trying to outdo those who do good to us, in the good we do to them.


5.3.3
2530
ὡς δὲ τοῦτ’ ἤκουσαν , πάντες μὲν ἐπῄνουν , πάντες δ’ ἐνεκωμίαζον ·
When they heard this they all signified their approval and applauded the proposition;


5.3.3
2531
εἷς δὲ καὶ ἔλεξεν ὧδε ·
and one of them also spoke as follows:


5.3.3
2532
πάνυ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , τοῦτο ποιήσωμεν ·
By all means, Cyrus, said he, let us do that.


5.3.3
2533
καὶ γάρ μοι δοκεῖ , ἔφη , ὁ Γωβρύας πτωχούς τινας ἡμᾶς νομίζειν , ὅτι οὐ δαρεικῶν μεστοὶ ἥκομεν οὐδὲ ἐκ χρυσῶν πίνομεν φιαλῶν ·
And it would be a good stroke of policy, too; for it seems to me that Gobryas regards us as no better than a lot of beggars because we have not come here with our pockets full of darics and because we do not drink from golden goblets.


5.3.3
2534
εἰ δὲ τοῦτο ποιήσομεν , γνοίη ἄν , ἔφη , ὅτι ἔστιν ἐλευθερίους εἶναι καὶ ἄνευ χρυσοῦ .
And if we do this, then he would realize that it is possible for men to be gentlemen, even without gold.


5.3.4
2535
ἄγε δή , ἔφη , τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἀποδόντες τοῖς μάγοις καὶ ὅσα τῇ στρατιᾷ ἱκανὰ ἐξελόντες τ- ἄλλα καλέσαντες τὸν Γωβρύαν δότε αὐτῷ ·
Come then, said Cyrus, turn over to the magi what belongs to the gods, set apart for the army its share, and then call Gobryas in and give the rest to him.


5.3.4
2536
οὕτω δὴ λαβόντες ἐκεῖνοι ὅσα ἔδει τ- ἄλλα ἔδοσαν τῷ Γωβρύᾳ .
So they set aside what was required and gave the rest to Gobryas.


5.3.5
2537
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ᾔει πρὸς Βαβυλῶνα παραταξάμενος ὥσπερ ὅτε ἡ μάχη ἦν .
After this Cyrus renewed his march upon Babylon, with his army in the same order as when the battle was fought.


5.3.5
2538
ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἀντεξῇσαν οἱ Ἀσσύριοι , ἐκέλευσεν ὁ Κῦρος τὸν Γωβρύαν προσελάσαντα εἰπεῖν ὅτι εἰ βούλεται ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐξιὼν ὑπὲρ τῆς χώρας μάχεσθαι , κἂν αὐτὸς σὺν ἐκείνῳ μάχοιτο ·
But as the Assyrians did not march out to meet them, Cyrus ordered Gobryas to ride up and say: If the king wishes to come out and fight for his country, I myself would join him and fight for him too;


5.3.5
2539
εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀμυνεῖ τῇ χώρᾳ , ὅτι ἀνάγκη τοῖς κρατοῦσι πείθεσθαι .
but if the king will not protect his country, then I must needs submit to the victors.


5.3.6
2540
ὁ μὲν δὴ Γωβρύας προσελάσας ἔνθα ἀσφαλὲς ἦν ταῦτα εἶπεν , ὁ δ’ αὐτῷ ἐξέπεμψεν ἀποκρινούμενον τοιάδε ·
Accordingly, Gobryas rode to a place where he could safely give his message; and the king sent out a messenger to deliver to Gobryas this reply:


5.3.6
2541
δεσπότης ὁ σὸς λέγει , ὦ Γωβρύα , οὐχ ὅτι ἀπέκτεινά σου τὸν υἱὸν μεταμέλει μοι , ἀλλ’ ὅτι οὐ καὶ σὲ προσαπέκτεινα .
This is your sovereign’s response to you, Gobryas: I do not regret that I killed your son, but only that I did not kill you, too.


5.3.6
2542
μάχεσθαι δὲ ἐὰν βούλησθε , ἥκετε εἰς τριακοστὴν ἡμέραν ·
And if you and your men wish to fight, come back a month from now.


5.3.6
2543
νῦν δ’ οὔπω ἡμῖν σχολή ·
Just at present we have no time to fight,


5.3.6
2544
ἔτι γὰρ παρασκευαζόμεθα .
for we are still busy with our preparations.


5.3.7
2545
ὁ δὲ Γωβρύας εἶπεν ·
Gobryas replied:


5.3.7
2546
ἀλλὰ μήποτέ σοι λήξειεν αὕτη ἡ μεταμέλεια ·
I only hope that this regret of yours may never cease;


5.3.7
2547
δῆλον γὰρ ὅτι ἀνιῶ σέ τι , ἐξ οὗ αὕτη σε ἡ μεταμέλεια ἔχει .
for it is evident that I have been something of a thorn in your flesh, ever since you began to feel it.


5.3.8
2548
ὁ μὲν δὴ Γωβρύας ἀπήγγειλε τὰ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου ·
Gobryas returned with the Assyrian king’s reply,


5.3.8
2549
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἀκούσας ταῦτα ἀπήγαγε τὸ στράτευμα ·
and when Cyrus heard it he drew off his army;


5.3.8
2550
καὶ καλέσας τὸν Γωβρύαν εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , οὐκ ἔλεγες μέντοι σὺ ὅτι τὸν ἐκτμηθέντα ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου οἴει ἂν σὺν ἡμῖν γενέσθαι ;
then summoning Gobryas he said to him: Tell me, you were saying, were you not, that you thought that the prince who was castrated by the Assyrian would be on our side?


5.3.8
2551
εὖ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη , δοκῶ εἰδέναι ·
Why, of course; he replied,


5.3.8
2552
πολλὰ γὰρ δὴ ἔγωγε κ- ἐκεῖνος ἐπαρρησιασάμεθα πρὸς ἀλλήλους .
I feel perfectly sure of it; for he and I have often talked together freely.


5.3.9
2553
ὁπότε τοίνυν σοι δοκεῖ καλῶς ἔχειν , πρόσιθι πρὸς αὐτόν ·
Well then, when you think best, go to him;


5.3.9
2554
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν οὕτω ποίει ὅπως ἂν αὐτοὶ ὅ τι ἂν λέγῃ εἰδῆτε ·
but first of all be sure that you meet him alone and in secret;


5.3.9
2555
ἐπειδὰν δὲ συγγένῃ αὐτῷ , ἐὰν γνῷς αὐτὸν φίλον βουλόμενον εἶναι , τοῦτο δεῖ μηχανᾶσθαι ὅπως λάθῃ φίλος ὢν ἡμῖν ·
and when you have conferred with him, if you see that he wishes to be our friend, you must manage to keep his friendship a secret.


5.3.9
2556
οὔτε γὰρ ἂν φίλους τις ποιήσειεν ἄλλως πως πλείω ἀγαθὰ ἐν πολέμῳ ἢ πολέμιος δοκῶν εἶναι οὔτ’ ἂν ἐχθροὺς πλείω τις βλάψειεν ἄλλως πως ἢ φίλος δοκῶν εἶναι .
For in time of war one could not in any way do more good to one’s friends than by seeming to be their enemy, nor more harm to enemies than by seeming to be their friend.


5.3.10
2557
καὶ μήν , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , οἶδ’ ὅτι κἂν πρίαιτο Γαδάτας τὸ μέγα τι ποιῆσαι κακὸν τὸν νῦν βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων .
Now mark my word, said Gobryas;


5.3.10
2558
ἀλλ’ ὅ τι ἂν δύναιτο , τοῦτο δεῖ καὶ ἡμᾶς σκοπεῖν .
I am sure that Gadatas would even pay for the opportunity of doing the present Assyrian king some serious harm. But what harm he could do it is for us on our part to consider.


5.3.11
2559
λέγε δή μοι , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , εἰς τὸ φρούριον τὸ πρὸ τῆς χώρας , ὅ φατε Ὑρκανίοις τε καὶ Σάκαις ἐπιτετειχίσθαι τῇδε τῇ χώρᾳ πρόβολον εἶναι τοῦ πολέμου , ἆρ’ ἄν , ἔφη , οἴει ὑπὸ τοῦ φρουράρχου παρεθῆναι τὸν εὐνοῦχον ἐλθόντα σὺν δυνάμει ;
Now tell me this, said Cyrus, in regard to the fort which stands upon the frontier of the country and which you say was built to serve as a base of operations against the Hyrcanians and the Sacians and an outwork to protect this country in time of war — do you think that the eunuch, if he went there with his army, would be admitted by the commandant?


5.3.11
2560
σαφῶς γ’ , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , εἴπερ ἀνύποπτος ὤν , ὥσπερ νῦν ἐστιν , ἀφίκοιτο πρὸς αὐτόν .
Yes; certainly he would, said Gobryas, if he came to him as unsuspected as he now is.


5.3.12
2561
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , ἀνύποπτος ἂν εἴη , εἰ προσβάλοιμι μὲν ἐγὼ πρὸς τὰ χωρία αὐτοῦ ὡς λαβεῖν βουλόμενος , ἀπομάχοιτο δὲ ἐκεῖνος ἀνὰ κράτος ·
Then, answered Cyrus, if I should make an attack on his fortifications as if I wished to gain possession of them, while he defended himself with all his might;


5.3.12
2562
καὶ λάβοιμι μὲν αὐτοῦ τι ἐγώ , ἀντιλάβοι δὲ κ- ἐκεῖνος ἡμῶν ἢ ἄλλους τινὰς ἢ καὶ ἀγγέλους πεμπομένους ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ πρὸς τούτους οὕς φατε πολεμίους τῷ Ἀσσυρίῳ εἶναι ·
and if I should take something of his and he in turn should capture either some of our other men or some of the messengers I send to those who, you say, are enemies of the Assyrian king;


5.3.12
2563
καὶ οἱ μὲν ληφθέντες λέγοιεν ὅτι ἐπὶ στρατεύματα ἔρχονται καὶ κλίμακας ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ φρούριον ἄξοντες , ὁ δ’ εὐνοῦχος ἀκούσας προσποιήσαιτο προαγγεῖλαι βουλόμενος ταῦτα παρεῖναι ;
and if these captives should say that they had come out to get an army and ladders to use against the fortress; and if then the eunuch, on hearing this, should pretend that he had come to give warning;


5.3.13
2564
καὶ ὁ Γωβρύας εἶπεν ὅτι οὕτω μὲν γιγνομένων σαφῶς παρείη ἂν αὐτόν , καὶ δέοιτό γ’ ἂν αὐτοῦ μένειν ἔστε σὺ ἀπέλθοις .
Under such circumstances, answered Gobryas, the commandant would certainly admit him — aye, and would beg him to remain there until you went away.


5.3.13
2565
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , εἴ γε ἅπαξ εἰσέλθοι , δύναιτ’ ἂν ἡμῖν ὑποχείριον ποιῆσαι τὸ χωρίον ;
Well then, said Cyrus, if he could but once get in, he would be in a position to put the fort in our hands?


5.3.14
2566
εἰκὸς γοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , τὰ μὲν ἔνδον ἐκείνου συμπαρασκευάζοντος , τὰ δ’ ἔξωθεν σοῦ ἰσχυρότερα προσάγοντος .
That is at all events probable, answered Gobryas, if he were within, helping with the preparations, while you on the outside made a vigorous attack.


5.3.14
2567
ἴθι οὖν , ἔφη , καὶ πειρῶ ταῦτα διδάξας καὶ διαπραξάμενος παρεῖναι ·
In that case, Cyrus replied, go and try to explain these plans to him and win his cooperation and then return.


5.3.14
2568
πιστὰ δὲ αὐτῷ οὐκ ἂν μείζω οὔτ’ εἴποις οὔτε δείξαις ὧν αὐτὸς σὺ τυγχάνεις παρ’ ἡμῶν εἰληφώς .
And no better assurance of our good faith could you give him in word or deed than to show him what you happen to have received at our hands.


5.3.15
2569
ἐκ τούτου ᾤχετο μὲν ὁ Γωβρύας ·
Thereupon Gobryas went away;


5.3.15
2570
ἄσμενος δὲ ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ὁ εὐνοῦχος συνωμολόγει τε πάντα καὶ συνέθετο ἃ ἔδει .
and when the eunuch saw him, he gladly concurred in all the plans and settled with him the things they were to do.


5.3.15
2571
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀπήγγειλεν ὁ Γωβρύας ὅτι πάντα δοκοίη ἰσχυρῶς τῷ εὐνούχῳ τὰ ἐπισταλέντα , ἐκ τούτου τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ προσέβαλε μὲν ὁ Κῦρος , ἀπεμάχετο δὲ ὁ Γαδάτας .
So, when Gobryas reported back that all the proposals were heartily accepted by the eunuch, on the day following Cyrus made his attack and Gadatas his defence.


5.3.15
2572
ἦν δὲ καὶ ὃ ἔλαβε χωρίον ὁ Κῦρος , ὁποῖον ἔφη ὁ Γαδάτας .
And there was also a fort which Cyrus took, as Gadatas had indicated;


5.3.16
2573
τῶν δὲ ἀγγέλων οὓς ἔπεμψεν ὁ Κῦρος προειπὼν ᾗ πορεύσοιντο , ὅπως ἄγοιεν τὰ στρατεύματα καὶ τὰς κλίμακας κομίζοιεν , τοὺς μὲν εἴασεν ὁ Γαδάτας διαφεύγειν ·
while of the messengers whom Cyrus sent with instructions which way to go, some Gadatas allowed to escape to bring the troops and fetch the ladders;


5.3.16
2574
οὓς δ’ ἔλαβε , βασανίζων ἐναντίον πολλῶν , ὡς ἤκουσεν ἐφ’ ἃ ἔφασαν πορεύεσθαι , εὐθέως συσκευασάμενος ὡς ἐξαγγελῶν τῆς νυκτὸς ἐπορεύετο .
but some he took and straitly examined in the presence of many witnesses, and when he heard from them the purpose of their journey, he made ready at once and set out in the night as if to give the alarm.


5.3.17
2575
τέλος δὲ πιστευθεὶς ὡς βοηθὸς εἰσέρχεται εἰς τὸ φρούριον ·
And the end was that he was trusted and entered the fort as an ally to defend it;


5.3.17
2576
καὶ τέως μὲν συμπαρεσκεύαζεν ὅ τι δύναιτο τῷ φρουράρχῳ ·
and for a while he helped the commandant to the extent of his ability in making preparations;


5.3.17
2577
ἐπεὶ δὲ ὁ Κῦρος ἦλθε , καταλαμβάνει τὸ χωρίον συνεργοὺς ποιησάμενος καὶ τοὺς παρὰ τοῦ Κύρου αἰχμαλώτους .
but when Cyrus came, he made himself master of the place, employing also as his assistants in seizing it those men of Cyrus’s whom he had taken prisoners.


5.3.18
2578
ἐπεὶ δὲ τοῦτο ἐγένετο , εὐθὺς Γαδάτας ὁ εὐνοῦχος τὰ ἔνδον καταστήσας ἐξῆλθε πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον , καὶ τῷ νόμῳ προσκυνήσας εἶπε , χαῖρε , Κῦρε .
When this was accomplished, the eunuch, after setting things in order within the fort, came out and did him obeisance according to the custom and said:  Joy be with you, Cyrus !


5.3.19
2579
ἀλλὰ ποιῶ ταῦτ’ , ἔφη ·
So it is, said he;


5.3.19
2580
σὺ γάρ με σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς οὐ κελεύεις μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀναγκάζεις χαίρειν .
for by the favour of the gods you not only bid me joy but even compel me to be joyful.


5.3.19
2581
εὖ γὰρ ἴσθι , ἔφη , ὅτι ἐγὼ μέγα ποιοῦμαι φίλιον τοῦτο τὸ χωρίον τοῖς ἐνθάδε συμμάχοις καταλείπων ·
For believe me, I consider it a great advantage to leave this place friendly to my allies in this country.


5.3.19
2582
σοῦ δ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Γαδάτα , ὁ Ἀσσύριος παῖδας μέν , ὡς ἔοικε , τὸ ποιεῖσθαι ἀφείλετο , οὐ μέντοι τό γε φίλους δύνασθαι κτᾶσθαι ἀπεστέρησεν ·
From you, Gadatas, Cyrus went on, the Assyrian has, it seems, taken away the power of begetting children, but at any rate he has not deprived you of the ability of acquiring friends.


5.3.19
2583
ἀλλ’ εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι ἡμᾶς τοιούτους τῷ ἔργῳ τούτῳ φίλους πεποίησαι , οἵ σοι , ἐὰν δυνώμεθα , πειρασόμεθα μὴ χείρους βοηθοὶ παραστῆναι ἢ εἰ παῖδας ἐκγόνους ἐκέκτησο .
Let me assure you that by this deed you have made of us friends who will try, if we can, to stand by you and aid you no less efficiently than if we were your own children.


5.3.19
2584
ὁ μὲν ταῦτ’ ἔλεγεν .
Thus he spoke.


5.3.20
2585
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ ὁ Ὑρκάνιος ἄρτι ᾐσθημένος τὸ γεγενημένον προσθεῖ τῷ Κύρῳ καὶ λαβὼν τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ εἶπεν ·
Thus he spoke; and at this juncture the Hyrcanian king, who had just heard what had happened, ran up to Cyrus and taking his right hand said to him:


5.3.20
2586
ὦ μέγα ἀγαθὸν σὺ τοῖς φίλοις Κῦρε , ὡς πολλήν με τοῖς θεοῖς ποιεῖς χάριν ὀφείλειν ὅτι σοί με συνήγαγον .
O what a blessing you are to your friends, Cyrus, and what a debt of gratitude to the gods you lay upon me, because they have brought me into association with you!


5.3.21
2587
ἴθι νυν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καὶ λαβὼν τὸ χωρίον οὕπερ ἕνεκά με ἀσπάζῃ διατίθει αὐτὸ οὕτως ὡς ἂν τῷ ὑμετέρῳ φύλῳ πλείστου ἄξιον ᾖ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις συμμάχοις , μάλιστα δ’ , ἔφη , Γαδάτᾳ τουτῳΐ , ὃς ἡμῖν αὐτὸ λαβὼν παραδίδωσι .
Go then,  said Cyrus ,  take this fortress on account of which you congratulate me and so dispose of it that it may be of the most service to your people and to the rest of the allies, and especially,  he added,  to Gadatas here, who gained possession of it and delivered it to us.


5.3.22
2588
τί οὖν ;
What then? said the Hyrcanian.


5.3.22
2589
ἔφη ὁ Ὑρκάνιος , ἐπειδὰν Καδούσιοι ἔλθωσι καὶ Σάκαι καὶ οἱ ἐμοὶ πολῖται , καλέσωμεν καὶ τούτων , ἵνα κοινῇ βουλευσώμεθα πάντες ὅσοις προσήκει πῶς ἂν συμφορώτατα χρῴμεθα τῷ φρουρίῳ ;
When the Cadusians come and the Sacians and my people, are we to call in some of them also, that all of us who are concerned may consult together how we may use the fortress to the best advantage?


5.3.23
2590
ταῦτα μὲν οὕτω συνῄνεσεν ὁ Κῦρος ·
To this plan Cyrus gave assent.


5.3.23
2591
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνῆλθον οἷς ἔμελε περὶ τοῦ φρουρίου , ἐβουλεύσαντο κοινῇ φυλάττειν οἷσπερ ἀγαθὸν ἦν φίλιον ὄν , ὅπως αὐτοῖς μὲν πρόβολος εἴη πολέμου , τοῖς δ’ Ἀσσυρίοις ἐπιτετειχισμένον .
And when all those who were interested in the fort were gathered together, they decided that it should be occupied in common by those to whose advantage it was to have it in the hands of friends, so that it might be an outwork for them in time of war and a base of operations against the Assyrians.


5.3.24
2592
τούτων γενομένων πολὺ δὴ προθυμότερον καὶ πλείους καὶ Καδούσιοι συνεστρατεύοντο καὶ Σάκαι καὶ Ὑρκάνιοι ·
Because of this incident the Cadusians, Sacians, and Hyrcanians joined the expedition in greater numbers and with greatly increased zeal.


5.3.24
2593
καὶ συνελέγη ἐντεῦθεν στράτευμα Καδουσίων μὲν πελτασταὶ εἰς δισμυρίους καὶ ἱππεῖς εἰς τετρακισχιλίους , Σακῶν δὲ τοξόται εἰς μυρίους καὶ ἱπποτοξόται εἰς χιλίους ·
And thereafter a new division was added to the army, consisting of Cadusians, about twenty thousand targeteers and about four thousand horsemen; of Sacians, about ten thousand bowmen and about two thousand mounted archers;


5.3.24
2594
καὶ Ὑρκάνιοι δὲ πεζούς τε ὁπόσους ἐδύναντο προσεξέπεμψαν καὶ ἱππέας ἐξεπλήρωσαν εἰς δισχιλίους ·
while the Hyrcanians also sent as many more foot-soldiers as they could and filled up the ranks of their cavalry to the number of two thousand;


5.3.24
2595
τὸ γὰρ πρόσθεν καταλελειμμένοι ἦσαν πλείους οἴκοι αὐτοῖς ἱππεῖς , ὅτι καὶ οἱ Καδούσιοι καὶ οἱ Σάκαι τοῖς Ἀσσυρίοις πολέμιοι ἦσαν .
for up to this time most of their cavalry had been left at home, because the Cadusians and the Sacians were enemies of the Assyrians.


5.3.25
2596
ὅσον δὲ χρόνον ἐκαθέζετο ὁ Κῦρος ἀμφὶ τὴν περὶ τὸ φρούριον οἰκονομίαν , τῶν Ἀσσυρίων τῶν κατὰ ταῦτα τὰ χωρία πολλοὶ μὲν ἀπῆγον ἵππους , πολλοὶ δὲ ἀπέφερον ὅπλα , φοβούμενοι ἤδη πάντας τοὺς προσχώρους .
Now during the time that Cyrus  was busy with the arrangements about the fortress, many of the Assyrians of the country round about surrendered their horses and many laid down their arms, because now they were afraid of all their neighbours.


5.3.26
2597
ἐκ δὲ τούτου προσέρχεται τῷ Κύρῳ ὁ Γαδάτας καὶ λέγει ὅτι ἥκουσιν αὐτῷ ἄγγελοι ὡς ὁ Ἀσσύριος , ἐπεὶ πύθοιτο τὰ περὶ τοῦ φρουρίου , χαλεπῶς τε ἐνέγκοι καὶ συσκευάζοιτο ὡς ἐμβαλῶν εἰς τὴν αὑτοῦ χώραν .
And after this, Gadatas came to Cyrus and said that messengers had come to him with the information that when the Assyrian king heard the facts about the fortress, he was exceedingly wroth and was preparing to invade his country.


5.3.26
2598
ἐὰν οὖν ἀφῇς με , ὦ Κῦρε , τὰ τείχη ἂν πειραθείην διασῶσαι , τῶν δ’ ἄλλων μείων λόγος .
If, then, you will permit me to go, Cyrus, I should try to save the fortified places; the rest is of less account.


5.3.27
2599
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
If you start now, said Cyrus,


5.3.27
2600
ἐὰν οὖν ἴῃς νῦν , πότε ἔσῃ οἴκοι ;
when shall you reach home?


5.3.27
2601
καὶ ὁ Γαδάτας εἶπεν ·
The day after to-morrow, answered Gadatas,


5.3.27
2602
εἰς τρίτην δειπνήσω ἐν τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ .
I shall dine in my own land.


5.3.27
2603
ἦ καὶ τὸν Ἀσσύριον , ἔφη , οἴει ἐκεῖ ἤδη καταλήψεσθαι ;
But you do not think, do you, that you will find the Assyrian already there? said Cyrus.


5.3.27
2604
εὖ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη , οἶδα ·
Nay, I am sure of it, he replied;


5.3.27
2605
σπεύσει γὰρ ἕως ἔτι πρόσω δοκεῖς ἀπεῖναι .
for he will make haste while he thinks you are still far away.


5.3.28
2606
ἐγὼ δ’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ποσταῖος ἂν τῷ στρατεύματι ἐκεῖσε ἀφικοίμην ;
How many days, asked Cyrus, do you think it would take me with my army to get there?


5.3.28
2607
πρὸς τοῦτο δὴ ὁ Γαδάτας λέγει ·
Gadatas replied:


5.3.28
2608
πολὺ ἤδη , ὦ δέσποτα , ἔχεις τὸ στράτευμα καὶ οὐκ ἂν δύναιο μεῖον ἢ ἐν ἓξ ἢ ἑπτὰ ἡμέραις ἐλθεῖν πρὸς τὴν ἐμὴν οἴκησιν .
Sire,  your army now is large and you could not reach my residence in less than six or seven days.


5.3.28
2609
σὺ μὲν τοίνυν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ἄπιθι ὡς τάχιστα ·
Well said Cyrus, do you go as quickly as possible,


5.3.28
2610
ἐγὼ δ’ ὡς ἂν δυνατὸν ᾖ πορεύσομαι .
and I will follow as best I can.


5.3.29
2611
ὁ μὲν δὴ Γαδάτας ᾤχετο ·
So Gadatas went away,


5.3.29
2612
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος συνεκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν συμμάχων ·
and Cyrus summoned all the officers of the allies;


5.3.29
2613
καὶ ἤδη πολλοί τε ἐδόκουν καὶ καλοὶ κ- ἀγαθοὶ παρεῖναι ·
and there seemed to be there now many noble men and brave.


5.3.29
2614
ἐν οἷς δὴ λέγει ὁ Κῦρος ταῦτα .
In this assembly, then, Cyrus spoke as follows:


5.3.30
2615
ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , Γαδάτας διέπραξεν ἃ δοκεῖ πᾶσιν ἡμῖν πολλοῦ ἄξια εἶναι , καὶ ταῦτα πρὶν καὶ ὁτιοῦν ἀγαθὸν ὑφ’ ἡμῶν παθεῖν .
Friends and allies, Gadatas has done what seems a very valuable service to us all,


5.3.30
2616
νῦν δὲ ὁ Ἀσσύριος εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ ἐμβαλεῖν ἀγγέλλεται , δῆλον ὅτι ἅμα μὲν τιμωρεῖσθαι αὐτὸν βουλόμενος , ὅτι δοκεῖ ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ μεγάλα βεβλάφθαι ·
and that, too, before receiving any favour whatsoever at our hands.


5.3.30
2617
ἅμα δὲ ἴσως κ- ἐκεῖνο ἐννοεῖται ὡς εἰ οἱ μὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀφιστάμενοι μηδὲν ὑπ’ ἐκείνου κακὸν πείσονται , οἱ δὲ σὺν ἐκείνῳ ὄντες ὑφ’ ἡμῶν ἀπολοῦνται , ὅτι τάχα οὐδένα εἰκὸς σὺν αὐτῷ βουλήσεσθαι εἶναι .
And now comes the report that the Assyrian is going to invade his country, partly, as it seems plain, from a wish to punish him because he thinks Gadatas has done him a great wrong; and perhaps also he understands that if those who desert him for us do not suffer any harm at his hands, while those who follow him are destroyed by us, the chances are that very soon no one will be willing to stay with him.


5.3.31
2618
νῦν οὖν , ὦ ἄνδρες , καλόν τι ἄν μοι δοκοῦμεν ποιῆσαι , εἰ προθύμως Γαδάτᾳ βοηθήσαιμεν ἀνδρὶ εὐεργέτῃ ·
So now, my men, it seems to me that we should be doing what is fair, if we gave Gadatas, our benefactor, our heartiest assistance;


5.3.31
2619
καὶ ἅμα δίκαια ποιοῖμεν ἂν χάριν ἀποδιδόντες ·
and at the same time we should be doing only what is right in paying a debt of gratitude.


5.3.31
2620
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ σύμφορά γ’ ἄν , ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , πράξαιμεν ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς .
But apart from that, it seems to me that we should be gaining an advantage for ourselves.


5.3.32
2621
εἰ γὰρ πᾶσι φαινοίμεθα τοὺς μὲν κακῶς ποιοῦντας νικᾶν πειρώμενοι κακῶς ποιοῦντες , τοὺς δ’ εὐεργετοῦντας ἀγαθοῖς ὑπερβαλλόμενοι , εἰκὸς ἐκ τῶν τοιούτων φίλους μὲν πολλοὺς ἡμῖν βούλεσθαι γίγνεσθαι , ἐχθρὸν δὲ μηδένα ἐπιθυμεῖν εἶναι ·
For if we should show every one that we try to surpass in doing harm those who do us harm, and that we surpass in well-doing those who do well by us, the consequences of such conduct would be that many would wish to become our friends and not one would desire to be our enemy.


5.3.33
2622
εἰ δὲ ἀμελῆσαι δόξαιμεν Γαδάτα , πρὸς τῶν θεῶν ποίοις λόγοις ἂν ἄλλον πείθοιμεν χαρίζεσθαί τι ἡμῖν ;
But should we decide to abandon Gadatas, with what arguments under heaven could we ever persuade any one else to do us a favour?


5.3.33
2623
πῶς δ’ ἂν τολμῷμεν ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς ἐπαινεῖν ;
How could we have the effrontery to approve our own conduct?


5.3.33
2624
πῶς δ’ ἂν ἀντιβλέψαι τις ἡμῶν δύναιτο Γαδάτᾳ , εἰ ἡττῴμεθ’ αὐτοῦ εὖ ποιοῦντος τοσοῦτοι ὄντες ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς καὶ τούτου οὕτω διακειμένου ;
And how could any one of us look Gadatas in the face, if, as numerous as we are, we should be surpassed in well-doing by one man and that one a man in such a plight as Gadatas is?


5.3.34
2625
ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπεν ·
Thus he spoke,


5.3.34
2626
οἱ δὲ πάντες ἰσχυρῶς συνεπῄνουν ταῦτα ποιεῖν .
and all heartily agreed to do as he said.


5.3.34
2627
ἄγε τοίνυν , ἔφη , ἐπεὶ καὶ ὑμῖν συνδοκεῖ ταῦτα , ἐπὶ μὲν τοῖς ὑποζυγίοις καὶ ὀχήμασι καταλίπωμεν ἕκαστοι τοὺς μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐπιτηδειοτάτους πορεύεσθαι .
Come then, he continued, since you agree with these suggestions, and first, let us leave men in charge of the beasts of burden and the wagons, each division appointing such of their number as are best suited to go with them;


5.3.35
2628
Γωβρύας δ’ ἡμῖν ἀρχέτω αὐτῶν καὶ ἡγείσθω αὐτοῖς ·
and let Gobryas have command of them in our place and be their guide;


5.3.35
2629
καὶ γὰρ ὁδῶν ἔμπειρος καὶ τ- ἄλλα ἱκανός ·
For he is acquainted with the roads and in other ways is qualified for that task.


5.3.35
2630
ἡμεῖς δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ ἵπποις τοῖς δυνατωτάτοις καὶ ἀνδράσι πορευώμεθα , τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τριῶν ἡμερῶν λαβόντες ·
As for us, let us proceed with the most able-bodied men and horses, taking with us three days’ provisions.


5.3.35
2631
ὅσῳ δ’ ἂν κουφότερον συσκευασώμεθα καὶ εὐτελέστερον , τοσούτῳ ἥδιον τὰς ἐπιούσας ἡμέρας ἀριστήσομέν τε καὶ δειπνήσομεν καὶ καθευδήσομεν .
For the more lightly and simply equipped we go, the more we shall enjoy our luncheon and dinner and sleep in the days to follow.


5.3.35
2632
νῦν δ’ , ἔφη , πορευώμεθα ὧδε ·
And now let us march in the following order:


5.3.36
2633
πρώτους μὲν ἄγε σύ , Χρυσάντα , τοὺς θωρακοφόρους , ἐπεὶ ὁμαλή τε καὶ πλατεῖα ἡ ὁδός ἐστι , τοὺς ταξιάρχους ἔχων ἐν μετώπῳ πάντας ·
Chrysantas, do you lead in the van the men armed with breastplates, for the road is smooth and wide.


5.3.36
2634
ἡ δὲ τάξις ἑκάστη ἐφ’ ἑνὸς ἴτω ·
Have all your captains in front, each company following in single file;


5.3.36
2635
ἁθρόοι γὰρ ὄντες καὶ τάχιστα καὶ ἀσφαλέστατα πορευοίμεθ’ ἄν .
for, massed together, we can march with the greatest speed and the greatest safety.


5.3.37
2636
τούτου δ’ ἕνεκα , ἔφη , κελεύω τοὺς θωρακοφόρους ἡγεῖσθαι ὅτι τοῦτο βραδύτατόν ἐστι τοῦ στρατεύματος ·
And the reason why I direct the men armed with breastplates to lead the march is that they are the slowest portion of the army;


5.3.37
2637
τοῦ δὲ βραδυτάτου ἡγουμένου ἀνάγκη ῥᾳδίως ἕπεσθαι πάντα τὰ θᾶττον ἰόντα ·
and when the slowest lead, then all the more quickly moving troops can follow easily, as a matter of course.


5.3.37
2638
ὅταν δὲ τὸ τάχιστον ἡγῆται ἐν νυκτί , οὐδέν ἐστι θαυμαστὸν καὶ διασπᾶσθαι τὰ στρατεύματα ·
But when at night the light forces lead, it is not at all a strange thing for the line to be broken and a gap formed,


5.3.37
2639
τὸ γὰρ προταχθὲν ἀποδιδράσκει .
for the vanguard outstrips the rear.


5.3.38
2640
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις , ἔφη , Ἀρτάβαζος τοὺς Περσῶν πελταστὰς καὶ τοξότας ἀγέτω ·
Next let Artabazus follow at the head of the Persian targeteers and bowmen;


5.3.38
2641
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Ἀνδαμύας ὁ Μῆδος τὸ Μήδων πεζόν ·
following him, Andamyas, the Mede, in command of the Median infantry;


5.3.38
2642
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Ἔμβας τὸ Ἀρμενίων πεζόν ·
next, Embas with the Armenian infantry;


5.3.38
2643
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Ἀρτούχας Ὑρκανίους ·
then, Artuchas with the Hyrcanians;


5.3.38
2644
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Θαμβράδας τὸ Σακῶν πεζόν ·
he will be followed by Thambradas at the head of the Sacian infantry force


5.3.38
2645
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Δατάμας Καδουσίους .
and Datamas with that of the Cadusians.


5.3.39
2646
ἀγόντων δὲ καὶ οὗτοι πάντες ἐν μετώπῳ μὲν τοὺς ταξιάρχους ἔχοντες , δεξιοὺς δὲ τοὺς πελταστάς , ἀριστεροὺς δὲ τοὺς τοξότας τοῦ ἑαυτῶν πλαισίου ·
Let these all lead the way with their captains in front, the targeteers on the right and the archers on the left of their own squares;


5.3.39
2647
οὕτω γὰρ πορευόμενοι καὶ εὐχρηστότεροι γίγνονται .
for, marching thus, they are more easily handled.


5.3.40
2648
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις οἱ σκευοφόροι , ἔφη , πάντων ἑπέσθων ·
Next to these the camp-followers of all the army are to follow;


5.3.40
2649
οἱ δὲ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν ἐπιμελείσθων ὅπως συνεσκευασμένοι τε ὦσι πάντα πρὶν καθεύδειν καὶ πρῲ σὺν τοῖς σκεύεσι παρῶσιν εἰς τὴν τεταγμένην χώραν καὶ ὅπως κοσμίως ἕπωνται .
their officers should see to it that they have everything ready packed up before they sleep, and early in the morning let them be present with the baggage at the appointed place, ready to follow the march in proper order.


5.3.41
2650
ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς σκευοφόροις , ἔφη , τοὺς Πέρσας ἱππέας Μαδάτας ὁ Πέρσης ἀγέτω , ἔχων καὶ οὗτος τοὺς ἑκατοντάρχους τῶν ἱππέων ἐν μετώπῳ ·
After the camp-followers let Madatas, the Persian, bring up the Persian cavalry;


5.3.41
2651
ὁ δ’ ἑκατόνταρχος τὴν τάξιν ἀγέτω εἰς ἕνα , ὥσπερ οἱ πέζαρχοι .
let him also arrange the cavalry captains in front, and let each captain lead his company in single file, just like the infantry officers.


5.3.42
2652
ἐπὶ τούτοις Ῥαμβάκας ὁ Μῆδος ὡσαύτως τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ ἱππέας ·
After them will come Rhambacas, the Mede, with his cavalry in the same order;


5.3.42
2653
ἐπὶ τούτοις σύ , ὦ Τιγράνη , τὸ σεαυτοῦ ἱππικόν ·
after them you, Tigranes, with yours, and the rest of the cavalry officers, each with the forces with which he joined us.


5.3.42
2654
καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι δὲ ἵππαρχοι μεθ’ ὧν ἕκαστοι ἀφίκοντο πρὸς ἡμᾶς .
After them you Sacians are to fall in line;


5.3.42
2655
ἐπὶ τούτοις Σάκαι ἄγετε ·
and last of all, just as they came, the Cadusians will bring up the rear;


5.3.42
2656
ἔσχατοι δέ , ὥσπερ ἦλθον , Καδούσιοι ἰόντων ·
and you, Alceunas, who are their commander, for the present look out for all in the rear


5.3.42
2657
Αλκεύνα , σὺ δὲ ὁ ἄγων αὐτοὺς ἐπιμελοῦ τὸ νῦν εἶναι πάντων τῶν ὄπισθεν καὶ μηδένα ἔα ὕστερον τῶν σῶν ἱππέων γίγνεσθαι .
and do not allow any one to fall behind your horsemen.


5.3.43
2658
ἐπιμελεῖσθε δὲ τοῦ σιωπῇ πορεύεσθαι οἵ τε ἄρχοντες καὶ πάντες δὲ οἱ σωφρονοῦντες ·
Take care to march in silence, both officers and all who are wise;


5.3.43
2659
διὰ γὰρ τῶν ὤτων ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἀνάγκη μᾶλλον ἢ διὰ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἕκαστα καὶ αἰσθάνεσθαι καὶ πράττεσθαι ·
for in the night there is more need to use ears than eyes to secure information and to have things done.


5.3.43
2660
καὶ τὸ ταραχθῆναι δὲ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ πολὺ μεῖζόν ἐστι πρᾶγμα ἢ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ καὶ δυσκαταστατώτερον ·
And to be thrown into confusion in the night is a much more serious matter than in the daytime and one more difficult to remedy.


5.3.43
2661
οὗ ἕνεκα ἥ τε σιωπὴ ἀσκητέα καὶ ἡ τάξις φυλακτέα .
Therefore let silence be maintained, and let the prescribed order be preserved.


5.3.44
2662
τὰς δὲ νυκτερινὰς φυλακάς , ὅταν μέλλητε νυκτὸς ἀναστήσεσθαι , χρὴ ὡς βραχυτάτας καὶ πλείστας ποιεῖσθαι , ὡς μηδένα ἡ ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ ἀγρυπνία πολλὴ οὖσα λυμαίνηται ἐν τῇ πορείᾳ ·
And the night watches, whenever you are to start off before daylight, must be made as short and as numerous as possible, so that want of sleep on account of doing sentinel duty may not be serious and exhaust the men for the march.


5.3.44
2663
ἡνίκα δ’ ἂν ὥρα ᾖ πορεύεσθαι , σημαίνειν τῷ κέρατι .
And when the hour for starting comes, let the signal be given on the horn.


5.3.45
2664
ὑμεῖς δ’ ἔχοντες ἃ δεῖ ἕκαστοι πάρεστε εἰς τὴν ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνος ὁδόν ·
And then do you all, with whatever is necessary, step out into the road to Babylon;


5.3.45
2665
ὁ δ’ ὁρμώμενος ἀεὶ τῷ κατ’ οὐρὰν παρεγγυάτω ἕπεσθαι .
and let each commander, as he gets his division in motion, pass the word to the man behind him to come on.


5.3.46
2666
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ᾤχοντο ἐπὶ τὰς σκηνὰς καὶ ἅμα ἀπιόντες διελέγοντο πρὸς ἀλλήλους ὡς μνημονικῶς ὁ Κῦρος ὁπόσοις συνέταττε πᾶσιν ὀνομάζων ἐνετέλλετο .
Hereupon they went to their tents, and, as they went, they remarked to one another what a good memory Cyrus  had and how he called every one by name as he assigned them their places and gave them their instructions.


5.3.47
2667
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐπιμελείᾳ τοῦτο ἐποίει ·
Now Cyrus made a study of this;


5.3.47
2668
πάνυ γὰρ αὐτῷ ἐδόκει θαυμαστὸν εἶναι εἰ οἱ μὲν βάναυσοι ἴσασι τῆς αὑτοῦ τέχνης ἕκαστος τῶν ἐργαλείων τὰ ὀνόματα , καὶ ὁ ἰατρὸς δὲ οἶδε καὶ τῶν ὀργάνων καὶ τῶν φαρμάκων οἷς χρῆται πάντων τὰ ὀνόματα , ὁ δὲ στρατηγὸς οὕτως ἠλίθιος ἔσοιτο ὥστε οὐκ εἴσοιτο τῶν ὑφ’ αὑτῷ ἡγεμόνων τὰ ὀνόματα , οἷς ἀνάγκη ἐστὶν αὐτῷ ὀργάνοις χρῆσθαι καὶ ὅταν καταλαβεῖν τι βούληται καὶ ὅταν φυλάξαι καὶ ὅταν θαρρῦναι καὶ ὅταν φοβῆσαι ·
for he thought it passing strange that, while every mechanic knows the names of the tools of his trade and the physician knows the names of all the instruments and medicines he uses, the general should be so foolish as not to know the names of the officers under him; and yet he must employ them as his instruments not only whenever he wishes to capture a place or defend one, but also whenever he wishes to inspire courage or fear.


5.3.47
2669
καὶ τιμῆσαι δὲ ὁπότε τινὰ βούλοιτο , πρέπον αὐτῷ ἐδόκει εἶναι ὀνομαστὶ προσαγορεύειν .
And whenever Cyrus wished to honour any one, it seemed to him proper to address him by name.


5.3.48
2670
ἐδόκουν δ’ αὐτῷ οἱ γιγνώσκεσθαι δοκοῦντες ὑπὸ τοῦ ἄρχοντος καὶ τοῦ καλόν τι ποιοῦντες ὁρᾶσθαι μᾶλλον ὀρέγεσθαι καὶ τοῦ αἰσχρόν τι ποιεῖν μᾶλλον προθυμεῖσθαι ἀπέχεσθαι .
Furthermore, it seemed to him that those who were conscious of being personally known to their general exerted themselves more to be seen doing something good and were more ready to abstain from doing anything bad.


5.3.49
2671
ἠλίθιον δὲ καὶ τοῦτ’ ἐδόκει εἶναι αὐτῷ τὸ ὁπότε τι βούλοιτο πραχθῆναι , οὕτω προστάττειν ὥσπερ ἐν οἴκῳ ἔνιοι δεσπόται προστάττουσιν , ἴτω τις ἐφ’ ὕδωρ , ξύλα τις σχισάτω ·
And when he wanted a thing done, he thought it foolish to give orders as do some masters in their homes:  Some one go get water!   Some one split wood!


5.3.50
2672
οὕτω γὰρ προσταττομένων εἰς ἀλλήλους τε ὁρᾶν πάντες ἐδόκουν αὐτῷ καὶ οὐδεὶς περαίνειν τὸ προσταχθὲν καὶ πάντες ἐν αἰτίᾳ εἶναι καὶ οὐδεὶς τῇ αἰτίᾳ οὔτε αἰσχύνεσθαι οὔτε φοβεῖσθαι ὁμοίως διὰ τὸ σὺν πολλοῖς αἰτίαν ἔχειν ·
For when orders are given in that way, all, he thought, looked at one another and no one carried out the order; all were to blame, but no one felt shame or fear as he should, because he shared the blame with many.


5.3.50
2673
διὰ ταῦτα δὴ πάντας ὠνόμαζεν αὐτὸς ὅτῳ τι προστάττοι .
It was for this reason, therefore, that he himself spoke to every one by name to whom he had any command to give.


5.3.51
2674
καὶ Κῦρος μὲν δὴ περὶ τούτων οὕτως ἐγίγνωσκεν .
Such, at least, was Cyrus’s opinion about this matter.


5.3.51
2675
οἱ δὲ στρατιῶται τότε μὲν δειπνήσαντες καὶ φυλακὰς καταστησάμενοι καὶ συσκευασάμενοι πάντα ἃ ἔδει ἐκοιμήθησαν .
The soldiers, however, then went to dinner, stationed sentinels, packed up everything they needed, and went to bed.


5.3.52
2676
ἡνίκα δ’ ἦν ἐν μέσῳ νυκτῶν , ἐσήμηνε τῷ κέρατι .
At midnight the signal horn sounded.


5.3.52
2677
Κῦρος δ’ εἰπὼν τῷ Χρυσάντᾳ ὅτι ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ ὑπομενοίη ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν τοῦ στρατεύματος ἐξῄει λαβὼν τοὺς ἀμφ’ αὑτὸν ὑπηρέτας ·
Cyrus informed Chrysantas that he would wait for him on the road ahead of the army, took with him his aides-de-camp, and went on;


5.3.52
2678
βραχεῖ δὲ χρόνῳ ὕστερον Χρυσάντας παρῆν ἄγων τοὺς θωρακοφόρους .
and a short time afterward Chrysantas came up at the head of his heavy-armed soldiers.


5.3.53
2679
τούτῳ μὲν ὁ Κῦρος δοὺς ἡγεμόνας τῆς ὁδοῦ πορεύεσθαι ἐκέλευεν ἡσύχως ·
To him Cyrus turned over the guides and bade him advance leisurely,


5.3.53
2680
οὐ γάρ πω ἐν ὁδῷ πάντες ἦσαν ·
for the troops were not yet all on the way.


5.3.53
2681
αὐτὸς δὲ ἑστηκὼς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τὸν μὲν προσιόντα προυπέμπετο ἐν τάξει , ἐπὶ δὲ τὸν ὑστερίζοντα ἔπεμπε καλῶν .
He himself took his stand by the roadside, and as the troops came on he sent them forward in their order, and to those who were late he sent a messenger to bid them hasten.


5.3.54
2682
ἐπεὶ δὲ πάντες ἐν ὁδῷ ἦσαν , πρὸς μὲν Χρυσάνταν ἱππέας ἔπεμψεν ἐροῦντας ὅτι ἐν ὁδῷ ἤδη πάντες ·
And when they were all on the road, he sent some horsemen to Chrysantas to say that they were now all on the way;


5.3.54
2683
ἄγε οὖν ἤδη θᾶττον .
Now then, double quick!


5.3.55
2684
αὐτὸς δὲ παρελαύνων τὸν ἵππον εἰς τὸ πρόσθεν ἥσυχος κατεθεᾶτο τὰς τάξεις .
He himself riding his horse leisurely along to the front inspected the ranks;


5.3.55
2685
καὶ οὓς μὲν ἴδοι εὐτάκτως καὶ σιωπῇ ἰόντας , προσελαύνων αὐτοῖς τίνες τε εἶεν ἠρώτα καὶ ἐπεὶ πύθοιτο ἐπῄνει ·
and to those whom he saw marching along in silence and in good order he would ride up and inquire who they were, and when he was informed he would praise them.


5.3.55
2686
εἰ δέ τινας θορυβουμένους αἴσθοιτο , τὸ αἴτιον τούτου σκοπῶν κατασβεννύναι τὴν ταραχὴν ἐπειρᾶτο .
But if he saw any in confusion, he would inquire into the cause of it and try to quiet the disorder.


5.3.56
2687
ἓν μόνον παραλέλειπται τῆς ἐν νυκτὶ ἐπιμελείας αὐτοῦ , ὅτι πρὸ παντὸς τοῦ στρατεύματος πεζοὺς εὐζώνους οὐ πολλοὺς προύπεμπεν , ἐφορωμένους ὑπὸ Χρυσάντα καὶ ἐφορῶντας αὐτὸν , ὡς ὠτακουστοῦντες καὶ εἴ πως ἄλλως δύναιντο αἰσθάνεσθαί τι , σημαίνοιεν τῷ Χρυσάντᾳ ὅ τι καιρὸς δοκοίη εἶναι ·
Only one of his measures of precaution that night has been left unmentioned — namely, that he sent out in front of the main body of the army a few light-armed infantrymen to keep Chrysantas in sight and be kept in sight by him, to listen and gather information in whatever way they could, and report to Chrysantas what it seemed expedient that he should know.


5.3.56
2688
ἄρχων δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις ἦν ὃς καὶ τούτους ἐκόσμει , καὶ τὸ μὲν ἄξιον λόγου ἐσήμαινε , τὸ δὲ μὴ οὐκ ἠνώχλει λέγων .
There was also an officer in command of them who kept them in order, and what was of importance he communicated to Chrysantas, but he did not trouble him by reporting what was immaterial.


5.3.57
2689
τὴν μὲν δὴ νύκτα οὕτως ἐπορεύοντο ·
In this manner, therefore, they proceeded all night long;


5.3.57
2690
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο , τοὺς μὲν Καδουσίων ἱππέας , ὅτι αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ πεζοὶ ἐπορεύοντο ἔσχατοι , παρὰ τούτοις κατέλιπεν , ὡς μηδ’ οὗτοι ψιλοὶ ἱππέων ἴοιεν ·
but when it became day, he left the cavalry of the Cadusians with their infantry (for these also were in the extreme rear), so that the latter might not be without the protection of cavalry;


5.3.57
2691
τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους εἰς τὸ πρόσθεν παρελαύνειν ἐκέλευσεν , ὅτι καὶ οἱ πολέμιοι ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν ἦσαν , ὅπως εἴ τί που ἐναντιοῖτο αὐτῷ , ἀπαντῴη ἔχων τὴν ἰσχὺν ἐν τάξει καὶ μάχοιτο , εἴ τέ τί που φεῦγον ὀφθείη , ὡς ἐξ ἑτοιμοτάτου διώκοι .
but the rest he ordered to ride up to the front, because the enemy were in front.


5.3.58
2692
ἦσαν δὲ αὐτῷ αἰεὶ τεταγμένοι οὕς τε διώκειν δέοι καὶ οὓς παρ’ αὐτῷ μένειν ·
He always kept drawn up in order one body of troops who were to pursue and another who were to stay with him;


5.3.58
2693
πᾶσαν δὲ τὴν τάξιν λυθῆναι οὐδέποτε εἴα .
but he never suffered his main line to be broken.


5.3.59
2694
Κῦρος μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἦγε τὸ στράτευμα ·
Thus, then, Cyrus led his army;


5.3.59
2695
οὐ μέντοι αὐτός γε μιᾷ χώρᾳ ἐχρῆτο , ἀλλ’ ἄλλοτε ἀλλαχῇ περιελαύνων ἐφεώρα τε καὶ ἐπεμελεῖτο , εἴ του δέοιντο .
but he himself did not keep to the same position, but riding about, now here, now there, kept watch, and if they needed anything, he provided for it.


5.3.59
2696
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἀμφὶ Κῦρον οὕτως ἐπορεύοντο .
Thus, then, Cyrus and his army were proceeding.


5.4.1
2697
ἐκ δὲ τοῦ Γαδάτα ἱππικοῦ τῶν δυνατῶν τις ἀνδρῶν ἐπεὶ ἑώρα αὐτὸν ἀφεστηκότα ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου , ἐνόμισεν , εἴ τι οὗτος πάθοι , αὐτὸς ἂν λαβεῖν παρὰ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου πάντα τὰ Γαδάτα ·
Now there was a certain man among the officers of Gadatas’s cavalry who, when he saw that his prince had revolted from the Assyrian, concluded that if some misfortune were to overtake Gadatas, he might himself obtain from the Assyrian all his chief’s wealth and power.


5.4.1
2698
οὕτω δὴ πέμπει τινὰ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ πιστῶν πρὸς τὸν Ἀσσύριον καὶ κελεύει τὸν ἰόντα , εἰ καταλάβοι ἤδη ἐν τῇ Γαδάτα χώρᾳ τὸ Ἀσσύριον στράτευμα , λέγειν τῷ Ἀσσυρίῳ ὅτι εἰ βούλοιτο ἐνεδρεῦσαι , λάβοι ἂν Γαδάταν καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ .
With this in view, he sent one of his trusted friends to the Assyrian, instructing his messenger, in case he found the Assyrian army already in Gadatas’s country, to tell their king that if he would lay an ambuscade, he would take Gadatas and his followers prisoners.


5.4.2
2699
δηλοῦν δὲ ἐνετέλλετο ὅσην τε εἶχεν ὁ Γαδάτας δύναμιν καὶ ὅτι Κῦρος οὐ συνέποιτο αὐτῷ ·
He furthermore commissioned him to explain how small an army Gadatas had and to make it clear that Cyrus was not with him;


5.4.2
2700
καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐδήλωσεν ᾗ προσιέναι μέλλοι .
he also pointed out the road by which Gadatas was likely to return;


5.4.2
2701
προσεπέστειλε δὲ τοῖς αὑτοῦ οἰκέταις , ὡς πιστεύοιτο μᾶλλον , καὶ τὸ τεῖχος ὃ ἐτύγχανεν αὐτὸς ἔχων ἐν τῇ Γαδάτα χώρᾳ παραδοῦναι τῷ Ἀσσυρίῳ καὶ τὰ ἐνόντα ·
and, that he might find fuller credence, he instructed his own subordinates to surrender to the Assyrian king, together with all that was in it, the fortress which he himself happened to be holding in Gadatas’s country.


5.4.2
2702
ἥξειν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔφασκεν , εἰ μὲν δύναιτο , ἀποκτείνας Γαδάταν , εἰ δὲ μή , ὡς σὺν τῷ Ἀσσυρίῳ τὸ λοιπὸν ἐσόμενος .
He promised besides that he would come himself when he had slain Gadatas, if he could, but that, if he failed in the attempt, at least he would in future be on the king’s side.


5.4.3
2703
ἐπεὶ δὲ ὁ ἐπὶ ταῦτα ταχθεὶς ἐλαύνων ὡς δυνατὸν ἦν τάχιστα ἀφικνεῖται πρὸς τὸν Ἀσσύριον καὶ ἐδήλωσεν ἐφ’ ἃ ἥκοι , ἀκούσας ἐκεῖνος τό τε χωρίον εὐθὺς παρέλαβε καὶ πολλὴν ἵππον ἔχων καὶ ἅρματα ἐνήδρευεν ἐν κώμαις ἁθρόαις .
And the man who had been given this commission rode as fast as his horse could carry him; he came into the presence of the Assyrian king and made known the purpose of his coming. When the king heard it, he at once took possession of the fortress and with a large force of horse and chariots laid his ambuscade in a cluster of villages.


5.4.4
2704
ὁ δὲ Γαδάτας ὡς ἐγγὺς ἦν τούτων τῶν κωμῶν , πέμπει τινὰς προδιερευνησομένους .
When Gadatas was not far from these villages, he sent some scouts on in advance to make a thorough search.


5.4.4
2705
ὁ δὲ Ἀσσύριος ὡς ἔγνω προσιόντας τοὺς διερευνητάς , φεύγειν κελεύει ἅρματα ἐξαναστάντα δύο ἢ τρία καὶ ἵππους ὀλίγους , ὡς δὴ φοβηθέντας καὶ ὀλίγους ὄντας .
And when the Assyrian was informed of the scouts’ approach, he ordered two or three chariots and several horsemen to start up and gallop off as if they were affrighted and only a few in number.


5.4.4
2706
οἱ δὲ διερευνηταὶ ὡς εἶδον ταῦτα , αὐτοί τε ἐδίωκον καὶ τῷ Γαδάτᾳ κατέσειον ·
When the scouts saw that, they started in pursuit themselves and beckoned to Gadatas to come on.


5.4.4
2707
καὶ ὃς ἐξαπατηθεὶς διώκει ἀνὰ κράτος .
He, too, was deceived and started at full speed in pursuit.


5.4.4
2708
οἱ δὲ Ἀσσύριοι , ὡς ἐδόκει ἁλώσιμος εἶναι ὁ Γαδάτας , ἀνίστανται ἐκ τῆς ἐνέδρας .
The Assyrians, in turn, when they thought Gadatas near enough to be taken, issued from their ambuscade.


5.4.5
2709
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀμφὶ Γαδάταν ἰδόντες ὥσπερ εἰκὸς ἔφευγον , οἱ δ’ αὖ ὥσπερ εἰκὸς ἐδίωκον .
And when Gadatas and his men saw this, they began to flee, as was natural;


5.4.5
2710
καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ὁ ἐπιβουλεύων τῷ Γαδάτᾳ παίει αὐτόν , καὶ καιρίας μὲν πληγῆς ἁμαρτάνει , τύπτει δὲ αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν ὦμον καὶ τιτρώσκει .
and the enemy, as was also natural, started in pursuit.


5.4.5
2711
ποιήσας δὲ τοῦτο ἐξίσταται , ἕως σὺν τοῖς διώκουσιν ἐγένετο ·
At this juncture, the man who was plotting against Gadatas struck a blow at him but failed to inflict a mortal wound; still he smote him on the shoulder and wounded him.


5.4.5
2712
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐγνώσθη ὃς ἦν , ὁμοῦ δὴ σὺν τοῖς Ἀσσυρίοις προθύμως ἐκτείνων τὸν ἵππον σὺν τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐδίωκεν .
When he had done this, he darted off to join the pursuing Assyrians; and when they recognized who he was, he took his place with them and urging his horse at full speed he joined with the king in the pursuit.


5.4.6
2713
ἐνταῦθα δὴ ἡλίσκοντο μὲν δῆλον ὅτι οἱ βραδυτάτους ἔχοντες τοὺς ἵππους ὑπὸ τῶν ταχίστων ·
Then those who had the slowest horses were evidently being overtaken by those who had the fleetest;


5.4.6
2714
ἤδη δὲ μάλα πάντες πιεζόμενοι διὰ τὸ κατατετρῦσθαι ὑπὸ τῆς πορείας οἱ τοῦ Γαδάτα ἱππεῖς καθορῶσι τὸν Κῦρον προσιόντα σὺν τῷ στρατεύματι ·
and just as Gadatas’s men were becoming quite exhausted, because they were already jaded and worn out by their march, they saw Cyrus coming up with his army,


5.4.6
2715
δοκεῖν δὲ χρὴ ἀσμένους καὶ ὥσπερ εἰς λιμένα ἐκ χειμῶνος προσφέρεσθαι αὐτούς .
and one may imagine that they rushed up to them with delight, like men putting into port out of a storm.


5.4.7
2716
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἐθαύμασεν ·
At first Cyrus was surprised;


5.4.7
2717
ὡς δ’ ἔγνω τὸ πρᾶγμα , ἔστε μὲν πάντες ἐναντίοι ἤλαυνον , ἐναντίος καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τάξει ἦγε τὴν στρατιάν ·
but when he comprehended the situation, he continued, while the enemy were all riding against him, to lead his army in battle order against them.


5.4.7
2718
ὡς δὲ γνόντες οἱ πολέμιοι τὸ ὂν ἐτράποντο εἰς φυγήν , ἐνταῦθα ὁ Κῦρος διώκειν ἐκέλευσε τοὺς πρὸς τοῦτο τεταγμένους , αὐτὸς δὲ σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις εἵπετο ὡς ᾤετο συμφέρειν .
But the enemy, recognizing the real state of affairs, turned and fled. Thereupon Cyrus ordered those who had been detailed for that purpose to start in pursuit, while he himself followed as he thought expedient.


5.4.8
2719
ἐνταῦθα δὴ καὶ ἅρματα ἡλίσκοντο , ἔνια μὲν καὶ ἐκπιπτόντων τῶν ἡνιόχων , τῶν μὲν ἐν τῇ ἀναστροφῇ , τῶν δὲ καὶ ἄλλως , ἔνια δὲ καὶ περιτεμνόμενα ὑπὸ τῶν ἱππέων ἡλίσκετο .
Here chariots also were captured, some because the charioteers were thrown out, a part of them from wheeling around too sharply, others for other reasons, while some were intercepted by the cavalry and taken.


5.4.8
2720
καὶ ἀποκτείνουσι δὲ ἄλλους τε πολλοὺς καὶ τὸν παίσαντα Γαδάταν .
And many men were slain, and among them the man who had wounded Gadatas.


5.4.9
2721
τῶν μέντοι πεζῶν Ἀσσυρίων , οἳ ἔτυχον τὸ Γαδάτα χωρίον πολιορκοῦντες , οἱ μὲν εἰς τὸ τεῖχος κατέφυγον τὸ ἀπὸ Γαδάτα ἀποστάν , οἱ δὲ φθάσαντες εἰς πόλιν τινὰ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου μεγάλην , ἔνθα καὶ αὐτὸς σὺν τοῖς ἵπποις καὶ τοῖς ἅρμασι κατέφυγεν ὁ Ἀσσύριος .
Of the Assyrian infantry, however, who happened to be besieging Gadatas’s fortress, some fled to that fort which had been lost to Gadatas by betrayal, others had time to reach a large city of Assyria, in which the king himself with his horsemen and chariots also took refuge.


5.4.10
2722
Κῦρος μὲν δὴ διαπραξάμενος ταῦτα ἐπαναχωρεῖ εἰς τὴν Γαδάτα χώραν ·
Now when Cyrus finished his pursuit of the enemy, he returned to Gadatas’s country;


5.4.10
2723
καὶ προστάξας οἷς ἔδει ἀμφὶ τὰ αἰχμάλωτα ἔχειν , εὐθὺς ἐπορεύετο , ὡς ἐπισκέψαιτο τὸν Γαδάταν πῶς ἔχοι ἐκ τοῦ τραύματος .
and after he had given instructions to those whose duty it was to take care of the spoil, he went at once to visit Gadatas and see how his wound was.


5.4.10
2724
πορευομένῳ δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Γαδάτας ἐπιδεδεμένος ἤδη τὸ τραῦμα ἀπαντᾷ .
But as he was going, he was met by Gadatas with his wound already bandaged.


5.4.10
2725
ἰδὼν δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ Κῦρος ἥσθη τε καὶ εἶπεν ·
And Cyrus was delighted at seeing him and said:


5.4.10
2726
ἐγὼ δὲ πρὸς σὲ ᾖα ἐπισκεψόμενος πῶς ἔχεις .
Why, I was coming to see how you were.


5.4.11
2727
ἐγὼ δέ γ’ , ἔφη ὁ Γαδάτας , ναὶ μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς σὲ ἐπαναθεασόμενος ᾖα ὁποῖός τίς ποτε φαίνῃ ἰδεῖν ὁ τοιαύτην ψυχὴν ἔχων ·
And I, by the gods, said Gadatas, was coming to gaze upon you again and see what you may look like, you who possess such a soul.


5.4.11
2728
ὅστις οὔτ’ οἶδα ἔγωγε ὅ τι νῦν ἐμοῦ δεόμενος οὔτε μὴν ὑποσχόμενός γέ μοι ταῦτα πράξειν οὔτ’ εὖ πεπονθὼς ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ εἴς γε τὸ ἴδιον οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν , ἀλλ’ ὅτι τοὺς φίλους ἔδοξά σοί τι ὀνῆσαι , οὕτω μοι προθύμως ἐβοήθησας ὡς νῦν τὸ μὲν ἐπ’ ἐμοὶ οἴχομαι , τὸ δ’ ἐπὶ σοὶ σέσωσμαι .
For though I do not see what need you now have of my assistance, and though you made no promise to do this for me and have been put under no obligation whatever to me, at least no personal obligation, yet because you fancied that I had given some assistance to your friends, you have come so gallantly to my relief that at this moment, whereas by myself I am a lost man, by your goodness I am saved.


5.4.12
2729
οὐ μὰ τοὺς θεούς , ὦ Κῦρε , εἰ ἦν οἷος ἔφυν ἐξ ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐπαιδοποιησάμην , οὐκ οἶδ’ ἂν εἰ ἐκτησάμην παῖδα τοιοῦτον περὶ ἐμέ ·
By the gods, Cyrus, if I were such a man as once I was and had children, I doubt if I could have had a child as kind to me as you have been;


5.4.12
2730
ἐπεὶ ἄλλους τε οἶδα παῖδας καὶ τοῦτον τὸν νῦν Ἀσσυρίων βασιλέα πολὺ πλείω ἤδη τὸν αὑτοῦ πατέρα ἀνιάσαντα ἢ σὲ νῦν δύναται ἀνιᾶν .
for I know that this present king of Assyria, like many another son that I have known, has caused his own father much more trouble than he can now cause you.


5.4.13
2731
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος πρὸς ταῦτα εἶπεν ὧδε ·
You fail to notice a much greater wonder, Gadatas, when you now express your wonder at me, Cyrus made reply.


5.4.13
2732
ὦ Γαδάτα , ἦ πολὺ μεῖζον παρεὶς θαῦμα ἐμὲ νῦν θαυμάζεις .
And what is that, pray? asked Gadatas.


5.4.13
2733
καὶ τί δὴ τοῦτ’ ἔστιν ;
That so many Persians have shown their interest in you, he answered,


5.4.13
2734
ἔφη ὁ Γαδάτας .
and so many Medes and Hyrcanians,


5.4.13
2735
ὅτι τοσοῦτοι μέν , ἔφη , Περσῶν ἐσπούδασαν περὶ σέ , τοσοῦτοι δὲ Μήδων , τοσοῦτοι δὲ Ὑρκανίων , πάντες δὲ οἱ παρόντες Ἀρμενίων καὶ Σακῶν καὶ Καδουσίων .
and all the Armenians, Sacians, and Cadusians here present.


5.4.14
2736
καὶ ὁ Γαδάτας ἐπηύξατο ·
Gadatas spoke in prayer:


5.4.14
2737
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Ζεῦ , ἔφη , καὶ τούτοις πόλλ’ ἀγαθὰ δοῖεν οἱ θεοί , καὶ πλεῖστα τῷ αἰτίῳ τοῦ καὶ τούτους τοιούτους εἶναι .
O Zeus,  I pray that the gods may grant many blessings to them and most of all to him who is responsible for their being so generous toward me.


5.4.14
2738
ὅπως μέντοι οὓς ἐπαινεῖς τούτους , ὦ Κῦρε , ξενίσωμεν καλῶς , δέχου τάδε ξένια οἷα ἐγὼ δοῦναι δύναμαι .
But, Cyrus, in order that we may entertain handsomely these men whom you have been praising, accept as gifts of friendship these trifles, such as I can give.


5.4.14
2739
ἅμα δὲ προσῆγε πάμπολλα , ὥστε καὶ θύειν τὸν βουλόμενον καὶ ξενίζεσθαι πᾶν τὸ στράτευμα ἀξίως τῶν καλῶς πεποιημένων καὶ καλῶς συμβάντων .
At the same time he had a great many things brought out, so that any one who wished might sacrifice and that the whole army might be entertained in a manner worthy of their deeds of glory and the glorious issue.


5.4.15
2740
ὁ δὲ Καδούσιος ὠπισθοφυλάκει καὶ οὐ μετέσχε τῆς διώξεως ·
The Cadusian prince had been guarding the rear and had no share in the pursuit;


5.4.15
2741
βουλόμενος δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς λαμπρόν τι ποιῆσαι , οὔτε ἀνακοινωσάμενος οὔτε εἰπὼν οὐδὲν Κύρῳ καταθεῖ τὴν πρὸς Βαβυλῶνα χώραν .
so, wishing to do something brilliant on his own account, he went off, without consulting Cyrus or saying anything to him, to make a foray into the country toward Babylon.


5.4.15
2742
διεσπασμένοις δὲ τοῖς ἵπποις αὐτοῦ ἀπιὼν ὁ Ἀσσύριος ἐκ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ πόλεως , οἷ κατέφυγε , συντυγχάνει μάλα συντεταγμένον ἔχων τὸ αὑτοῦ στράτευμα .
And as the Cadusian cavalry were scattered, the Assyrian, returning from his city in which he had taken refuge, came suddenly upon them with his own army in battle array.


5.4.16
2743
ὡς δ’ ἔγνω μόνους ὄντας τοὺς Καδουσίους , ἐπιτίθεται , καὶ τόν τε ἄρχοντα τῶν Καδουσίων ἀποκτείνει καὶ ἄλλους πολλούς , καὶ ἵππους τινὰς λαμβάνει τῶν Καδουσίων καὶ ἣν ἄγοντες λείαν ἐτύγχανον ἀφαιρεῖται .
And when he discovered that the Cadusians were alone, he made an attack, slew the commander of the Cadusians and many others, took some of their horses, and recovered the spoil which they happened to be carrying off.


5.4.16
2744
καὶ ὁ μὲν Ἀσσύριος διώξας ἄχρι οὗ ἀσφαλὲς ᾤετο εἶναι ἀπετράπετο ·
He also pursued them as far as he thought was safe and then turned back.


5.4.16
2745
οἱ δὲ Καδούσιοι ἐσῴζοντο πρὸς τὸ στρατόπεδον ἀμφὶ δείλην οἱ πρῶτοι .
So the survivors of the Cadusians arrived at the camp, the first of them towards evening.


5.4.17
2746
Κῦρος δ’ ὡς ᾔσθετο τὸ γεγονός , ἀπήντα τε τοῖς Καδουσίοις καὶ ὅντινα ἴδοι τετρωμένον ἀναλαμβάνων τοῦτον μὲν ὡς Γαδάταν ἔπεμπεν , ὅπως θεραπεύοιτο , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους συγκατεσκήνου καὶ ὅπως τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἕξουσι συνεπεμελεῖτο , παραλαμβάνων Περσῶν τῶν ὁμοτίμων συνεπιμελητάς ·
When Cyrus found out what had happened, he went out to meet them, and if he saw any one that was wounded he received him kindly and sent him on to Gadatas, that he might receive attention; the rest he helped into their tents and saw to it that they should have provisions, taking some of the Persian peers along to help him in looking after them.


5.4.17
2747
ἐν γὰρ τοῖς τοιούτοις οἱ ἀγαθοὶ ἐπιπονεῖν ἐθέλουσι .
For under such circumstances, the good are ready to undertake extra labour.


5.4.18
2748
καὶ ἀνιώμενος μέντοι ἰσχυρῶς δῆλος ἦν , ὡς καὶ τῶν ἄλλων δειπνούντων ἡνίκα ὥρα ἦν , Κῦρος ἔτι σὺν τοῖς ὑπηρέταις καὶ τοῖς ἰατροῖς οὐδένα ἑκὼν ἀτημέλητον παρέλειπεν , ἀλλ’ ἢ αὐτόπτης ἐφεώρα ἢ εἰ μὴ αὐτὸς ἐξανύτοι , πέμπων φανερὸς ἦν τοὺς θεραπεύσοντας .
Still Cyrus  was evidently very much distressed, so that, when the rest went to dinner at the usual hour, he with his aides and the surgeons did not go; for he would not wittingly leave any uncared for, but either looked after them in person, or, if he did not succeed in doing that, he showed his personal interest by sending some one to attend to them.


5.4.19
2749
καὶ τότε μὲν οὕτως ἐκοιμήθησαν .
Thus they went to sleep that evening.


5.4.19
2750
ἅμα δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ κηρύξας συνιέναι τῶν μὲν ἄλλων τοὺς ἄρχοντας , τοὺς δὲ Καδουσίους ἅπαντας , ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
At daybreak he made proclamation for all the Cadusians and the officers of the rest to assemble; and he addressed them as follows:


5.4.19
2751
ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , ἀνθρώπινον τὸ γεγενημένον ·
Friends and allies, that which has happened might happen to any man;


5.4.19
2752
τὸ γὰρ ἁμαρτάνειν ἀνθρώπους ὄντας οὐδὲν οἴομαι θαυμαστόν .
for it is not at all strange, I think, for mortal man to err.


5.4.19
2753
ἄξιοί γε μέντοι ἐσμὲν τοῦ γεγενημένου πράγματος τούτου ἀπολαῦσαί τι ἀγαθόν , τὸ μαθεῖν μήποτε διασπᾶν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὅλου δύναμιν ἀσθενεστέραν τῆς τῶν πολεμίων δυνάμεως .
Still it is worth our while to reap some benefit from this occurrence, the lesson never to detach from our main body a force weaker than the forces of the enemy.


5.4.20
2754
καὶ οὐ τοῦτο , ἔφη , λέγω ὡς οὐ δεῖ ποτε καὶ ἐλάττονι ἔτι μορίῳ ἰέναι , ὅπου ἂν δέῃ , ἢ νῦν ὁ Καδούσιος ᾤχετο ·
I do not mean by that that we should never go off, if circumstances require it, with a still smaller detachment than that with which the Cadusian prince went.


5.4.20
2755
ἀλλ’ ἐάν τις κοινούμενος ὁρμᾶται τῷ ἱκανῷ βοηθῆσαι , ἔστι μὲν ἀπαρτηθῆναι , ἔστι δὲ τῷ ὑπομένοντι ἐξαπατήσαντι τοὺς πολεμίους ἄλλοσε τρέψαι ἀπὸ τῶν ἐξεληλυθότων , ἔστι δὲ ἄλλα παρέχοντα πράγματα τοῖς πολεμίοις τοῖς φίλοις ἀσφάλειαν παρέχειν ·
But if an officer, when he starts on an expedition, communicates his intention to one that is able to bring help, he may possibly fall into a trap, but then it is equally possible for the one who remains behind to entrap the enemy and turn them away from the detached corps;


5.4.20
2756
καὶ οὕτω μὲν οὐδ’ ὁ χωρὶς ὢν ἀπέσται , ἀλλ’ ἐξαρτήσεται τῆς ἰσχύος ·
or he may annoy the enemy in some other way and so secure safety for his friends; and thus even those who are at a distance will not be out of reach but will keep in touch with the main body.


5.4.20
2757
ὁ δὲ ἀπεληλυθὼς μὴ ἀνακοινωσάμενος , ὅπου ἂν ᾖ , οὐδὲν διάφορον πάσχει ἢ εἰ μόνος ἐστρατεύετο .
But the man who goes off without communicating his purpose is in the same situation, no matter where he is, as if he were carrying on a campaign alone.


5.4.21
2758
ἀλλ’ ἀντὶ μὲν τούτου , ἔφη , ἐὰν θεὸς θέλῃ , ἀμυνούμεθα τοὺς πολεμίους οὐκ εἰς μακράν .
But in return for this, we shall ere long, God willing, have our revenge on the enemy.


5.4.21
2759
ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὰν τάχιστα ἀριστήσητε , ἄξω ὑμᾶς ἔνθα τὸ πρᾶγμα ἐγένετο ·
So, as soon as you have had luncheon, I shall lead you to the place where this befell.


5.4.21
2760
καὶ ἅμα μὲν θάψομεν τοὺς τελευτήσαντας , ἅμα δὲ δείξομεν τοῖς πολεμίοις ἔνθα κρατῆσαι νομίζουσιν ἐνταῦθα ἄλλους αὐτῶν κρείττους , ἢν θεὸς θέλῃ ·
There we shall not only bury the dead, but, God willing, on the very spot where the enemy think they have won a victory we will show them others better than they are.


5.4.21
2761
ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἀντεπεξίωσι , καύσομεν αὐτῶν τὰς κώμας καὶ δῃώσομεν τὴν χώραν , ἵνα μὴ ἃ ἡμᾶς ἐποίησαν ὁρῶντες εὐφραίνωνται , ἀλλὰ τὰ ἑαυτῶν κακὰ θεώμενοι ἀνιῶνται , καὶ ὅπως γε μηδὲ τὸ χωρίον ἡδέως ὁρῶσιν ἔνθα κατέκανον ἡμῶν τοὺς συμμάχους .
We shall at least let them have no satisfaction in looking even on the place where they slaughtered our allies. If they do not come out to meet us, we shall burn their villages and ravage their country, so that they may have no joy in viewing what they did to us but may be distressed at contemplating there their own misfortunes.


5.4.22
2762
οἱ μὲν οὖν ἄλλοι , ἔφη , ἀριστᾶτε ἰόντες ·
The rest of you, therefore, go to luncheon.


5.4.22
2763
ὑμεῖς δέ , ὦ Καδούσιοι , πρῶτον μὲν ἀπελθόντες ἄρχοντα ὑμῶν αὐτῶν ἕλεσθε ᾗπερ ὑμῖν νόμος , ὅστις ὑμῶν ἐπιμελήσεται σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς καὶ σὺν ἡμῖν , ἄν τι προσδέησθε ·
But you, Cadusians, go first and elect from your own number according to your custom a new general, who shall look out for your interests with the help of the gods and of us, if you have any need of our help as well;


5.4.22
2764
ἐπειδὰν δὲ ἕλησθε , πέμψατε πρὸς ἐμὲ τὸν αἱρεθέντα καὶ ἀριστήσατε .
and when you have made your choice, send the man you have elected to me.


5.4.23
2765
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἔπραξαν ·
So they did as he bade.


5.4.23
2766
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐπεὶ ἐξήγαγε τὸ στράτευμα , κατέστησεν εἰς τάξιν τὸν ᾑρημένον ὑπὸ τῶν Καδουσίων καὶ ἐκέλευσε πλησίον αὑτοῦ ἄγειν τὴν τάξιν , ὅπως , ἔφη , ἂν δυνώμεθα , ἀναθαρρύνωμεν τοὺς ἄνδρας .
And when Cyrus led the army out, he assigned the man elected by the Cadusians his position and bade him lead his contingent near to himself,  in order,  he said,  that we may, if we can, put new courage into your men.


5.4.23
2767
οὕτω δὴ ἐπορεύοντο ·
Thus, then, they proceeded;


5.4.23
2768
καὶ ἐλθόντες ἔθαπτον μὲν τοὺς Καδουσίους , ἐδῄουν δὲ τὴν χώραν .
and when they came to the place, they buried the Cadusians and ravaged the country.


5.4.23
2769
ποιήσαντες δὲ ταῦτα ἀπῆλθον τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἐκ τῆς πολεμίας ἔχοντες πάλιν εἰς τὴν Γαδάτα .
And when they had done so they returned again into the land of Gadatas, bringing their supplies from the enemy’s country.


5.4.24
2770
ἐννοήσας δὲ ὅτι οἱ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀφεστηκότες ὄντες πλησίον Βαβυλῶνος κακῶς πείσονται , ἂν μὴ αὐτὸς αἰεὶ παρῇ , οὕτως ὅσους τε τῶν πολεμίων ἀφίει , τούτους ἐκέλευε λέγειν τῷ Ἀσσυρίῳ , καὶ αὐτὸς κήρυκα ἔπεμψε πρὸς αὐτὸν τ- αὐτὰ λέγοντα , ὅτι ἕτοιμος εἴη τοὺς ἐργαζομένους τὴν γῆν ἐᾶν καὶ μὴ ἀδικεῖν , εἰ καὶ ἐκεῖνος βούλοιτο ἐᾶν ἐργάζεσθαι τοὺς τῶν πρὸς αὑτὸν ἀφεστηκότων ἐργάτας .
And when he reflected that those who had gone over to him would suffer severely, as they were in the vicinity of Babylon , if he were not always at hand, he ordered those of the enemy whom he released to tell the Assyrian king (he also sent a herald to bear the same message) that he was ready to leave in peace the labourers tilling the land and to do them no harm, provided the king, on his part, would be willing to allow those farmers who had transferred their allegiance to him to work their farms.


5.4.25
2771
καίτοι , ἔφη , σὺ μὲν ἂν καὶ δύνῃ κωλύειν , ὀλίγους τινὰς κωλύσεις ·
And yet, he had them say, even if you are able to hinder them, you will hinder but few;


5.4.25
2772
ὀλίγη γάρ ἐστι χώρα ἡ τῶν πρὸς ἐμὲ ἀφεστηκότων ·
for the country of those who have come over to me is small;


5.4.25
2773
ἐγὼ δὲ πολλὴν ἄν σοι χώραν ἐῴην ἐνεργὸν εἶναι .
while the land under your dominion that I should allow to be cultivated is extensive.


5.4.25
2774
εἰς δὲ τὴν τοῦ καρποῦ κομιδήν , ἐὰν μὲν πόλεμος ᾖ , ὁ ἐπικρατῶν οἶμαι καρπώσεται ·
Then, as to the harvesting of the crops, if there is war, the victor, I suppose, will do the reaping;


5.4.25
2775
ἐὰν δὲ εἰρήνη , δῆλον , ἔφη , ὅτι σύ .
but if there is peace, it is evident that you will do it.


5.4.25
2776
ἐὰν μέντοι τις ἢ τῶν ἐμῶν ὅπλα ἀνταίρηται σοὶ ἢ τῶν σῶν ἐμοί , τούτους , ἔφη , ὡς ἂν δυνώμεθα ἑκάτεροι ἀμυνούμεθα .
If, however, any of my adherents take up arms against you, or any of yours against me, upon such we will both execute vengeance according to our ability.


5.4.26
2777
ταῦτα ἐπιστείλας τῷ κήρυκι ἔπεμψεν αὐτόν .
This message he entrusted to the herald and sent him away.


5.4.26
2778
οἱ δὲ Ἀσσύριοι ὡς ἤκουσαν ταῦτα , πάντα ἐποίουν πείθοντες τὸν βασιλέα συγχωρῆσαι ταῦτα καὶ ὅτι μικρότατον τοῦ πολέμου λιπεῖν .
And when the Assyrians heard it, they did everything they could to persuade the king to accept the proposal, and to leave as little of the war as possible.


5.4.27
2779
καὶ ὁ Ἀσσύριος μέντοι εἴτε ὑπὸ τῶν ὁμοφύλων πεισθεὶς εἴτε καὶ αὐτὸς οὕτω βουληθεὶς συνῄνεσε ταῦτα ·
The Assyrian king, moreover, whether because he was persuaded by his countrymen or whether he himself also wished it so, agreed to the proposal;


5.4.27
2780
καὶ ἐγένοντο συνθῆκαι τοῖς μὲν ἐργαζομένοις εἰρήνην εἶναι , τοῖς δ’ ὁπλοφόροις πόλεμον .
so a covenant was made to the effect that the farmers should have peace, but the men under arms war.


5.4.28
2781
ταῦτα μὲν δὴ διεπέπρακτο περὶ τῶν ἐργατῶν ὁ Κῦρος ·
This concession Cyrus obtained for the farming classes.


5.4.28
2782
τὰς μέντοι νομὰς τῶν κτηνῶν τοὺς μὲν ἑαυτοῦ φίλους ἐκέλευσε καταθέσθαι , εἰ βούλοιντο , ἐν τῇ ἑαυτῶν ἐπικρατείᾳ ·
But as for the herds out grazing, he ordered his friends, if they wished, to drive them in and keep them in the territory under their own control;


5.4.28
2783
τὴν δὲ τῶν πολεμίων λείαν ἦγον ὁπόθεν δύναιντο , ὅπως εἴη ἡ στρατεία ἡδίων τοῖς συμμάχοις .
but the enemy’s cattle they brought in as their legitimate prey from whatever quarter they could, so that the allies might be better pleased with the expedition.


5.4.28
2784
οἱ μὲν γὰρ κίνδυνοι οἱ αὐτοὶ καὶ ἄνευ τοῦ λαμβάνειν τὰ ἐπιτήδεια , ἡ δ’ ἐκ τῶν πολεμίων τροφὴ κουφοτέραν τὴν στρατείαν ἐδόκει παρέχειν .
For the dangers were the same, even if they did not go foraging for provisions, while the burdens of war seemed lighter, if the army was to be fed at the enemy’s cost.


5.4.29
2785
ἐπεὶ δὲ παρεσκευάζετο ἤδη ὁ Κῦρος ὡς ἀπιών , παρῆν ὁ Γαδάτας ἄλλα τε δῶρα πολλὰ καὶ παντοῖα φέρων καὶ ἄγων ὡς ἂν ἐξ οἴκου μεγάλου , καὶ ἵππους δὲ ἦγε πολλοὺς ἀφελόμενος τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ἱππέων οἷς ἠπιστήκει διὰ τὴν ἐπιβουλήν .
When Cyrus  was making preparations to depart, Gadatas came to him and brought many gifts of every sort, as might be expected from a wealthy house, and, most important of all, he brought many horses that he had taken from horsemen of his own whom he had come to distrust on account of the conspiracy against him.


5.4.30
2786
ὡς δ’ ἐπλησίασεν , ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
When he came into Cyrus’s presence he spoke as follows:


5.4.30
2787
ὦ Κῦρε , νῦν μέν σοι ἐγὼ ταῦτα δίδωμι ἐν τῷ παρόντι , καὶ χρῶ αὐτοῖς , ἐὰν δέῃ τι ·
These gifts, Cyrus, I beg to offer you for the present; and do you accept them, if you have any use for them.


5.4.30
2788
νόμιζε δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ τ- ἄλλα πάντα τ- ἐμὰ σὰ εἶναι .
But pray consider that everything else of mine is yours;


5.4.30
2789
οὔτε γὰρ ἔστιν οὔτ’ ἔσται ποτὲ ὅτῳ ἐγὼ ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ φύντι καταλείψω τὸν ἐμὸν οἶκον ·
for there is not and never can be a child of my own to whom I can leave my estates,


5.4.30
2790
ἀλλ’ ἀνάγκη , ἔφη , σὺν ἐμοὶ τελευτῶντι πᾶν ἀποσβῆναι τὸ ἡμέτερον γένος καὶ ὄνομα .
but with my death our race and name must be altogether blotted out.


5.4.31
2791
καὶ ταῦτα , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ὄμνυμί σοι θεούς , οἳ καὶ ὁρῶσι πάντα καὶ ἀκούουσι πάντα , οὔτε ἄδικον οὔτε αἰσχρὸν οὐδὲν οὔτε εἰπὼν οὔτε ποιήσας ἔπαθον .
And by the gods, who see all things and hear all things, I swear to you, Cyrus, that it is not for anything wrong or base that I have said or done that I have suffered this affliction.


5.4.31
2792
καὶ ἅμα ταῦτα λέγων κατεδάκρυσε τὴν ἑαυτοῦ τύχην καὶ οὐκέτι ἐδυνήθη πλείω εἰπεῖν .
As he uttered these words he burst into tears over his lot and could say no more.


5.4.32
2793
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἀκούσας τοῦ μὲν πάθους ᾤκτιρεν αὐτόν , ἔλεξε δὲ ὧδε .
And Cyrus, as he listened, pitied him for his misfortune and answered him thus:


5.4.32
2794
ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὲν ἵππους δέχομαι , ἔφη ·
Your horses I accept; for I shall do you a service by giving them to men who are more loyal to you, it seems, than your own men who had them but now;


5.4.32
2795
σέ τε γὰρ ὠφελήσω εὐνουστέροις δοὺς αὐτοὺς ἢ οἳ νῦν σοι εἶχον , ὡς ἔοικεν , ἐγώ τε οὗ δὴ πάλαι ἐπιθυμῶ , τὸ Περσῶν ἱππικὸν θᾶττον ἐκπληρώσω εἰς τοὺς μυρίους ἱππέας ·
and for myself, I shall the sooner increase my Persian cavalry to full ten thousand horse, as I have been eager this long time to do.


5.4.32
2796
τὰ δ’ ἄλλα χρήματα σὺ ἀπαγαγὼν φύλαττε , ἔστ’ ἂν ἐμὲ ἴδῃς ἔχοντα ὥστε σοῦ μὴ ἡττᾶσθαι ἀντιδωρούμενον ·
But do you take these other things away and keep them until you see me in possession of wealth enough so that I shall not be outdone in requiting you.


5.4.32
2797
εἰ δὲ πλείω μοι δοὺς ἀπίοις ἢ λαμβάνοις παρ’ ἐμοῦ , μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅπως ἂν δυναίμην μὴ αἰσχύνεσθαι .
For if, as we part, you should give me larger gifts than you receive from me, by the gods, I do not see how I could possibly help being ashamed.


5.4.33
2798
πρὸς ταῦτα ὁ Γαδάτας εἶπεν ·
Well, said Gadatas in reply,


5.4.33
2799
ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μέν , ἔφη , πιστεύω σοι ·
I can trust you for that;


5.4.33
2800
ὁρῶ γάρ σου τὸν τρόπον ·
for I know your ways.


5.4.33
2801
φυλάττειν μέντοι ὅρα εἰ ἐπιτήδειός εἰμι .
Still, bethink you whether I am in a position to keep these things safe for you.


5.4.34
2802
ἕως μὲν γὰρ φίλοι ἦμεν τῷ Ἀσσυρίῳ , καλλίστη ἐδόκει εἶναι ἡ τοῦ ἐμοῦ πατρὸς κτῆσις ·
For while we were friends to the Assyrian king, my father’s estate seemed to me the finest in the world;


5.4.34
2803
τῆς γὰρ μεγίστης πόλεως Βαβυλῶνος ἐγγὺς οὖσα ὅσα μὲν ὠφελεῖσθαι ἔστιν ἀπὸ μεγάλης πόλεως , ταῦτα ἀπελαύομεν , ὅσα δὲ ἐνοχλεῖσθαι , οἴκαδε δεῦρ’ ἀπιόντες τούτων ἐκποδὼν ἦμεν ·
for it was so near to the mighty city of Babylon that we enjoyed all the advantages of a great city but could come back home and be rid of all its rush and worry.


5.4.34
2804
νῦν δ’ ἐπεὶ ἐχθροί ἐσμεν , δῆλον ὅτι ἐπειδὰν σὺ ἀπέλθῃς , καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐπιβουλευσόμεθα καὶ ὁ οἶκος ὅλος , καὶ οἶμαι λυπηρῶς βιωσόμεθα ὅλως τοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ πλησίον ἔχοντες καὶ κρείττους ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ὁρῶντες .
But now that we are his enemies, it is obvious that with your departure we ourselves and our whole house shall be the victims of plots; and I think we shall lead an utterly miserable life, for we shall have our enemies close at hand and see them stronger than ourselves.


5.4.35
2805
τάχ’ οὖν εἴποι τις ἄν ·
Perhaps, then, some one might say:


5.4.35
2806
καὶ τί δῆτα οὐχ οὕτως ἐνενοοῦ πρὶν ἀποστῆναι ;
And why, pray, did you not think of that before you revolted?


5.4.35
2807
ὅτι , ὦ Κῦρε , ἡ ψυχή μου διὰ τὸ ὑβρίσθαι καὶ ὀργίζεσθαι οὐ τὸ ἀσφαλέστατον σκοποῦσα διῆγεν , ἀλλ’ αἰεὶ τοῦτο κυοῦσ’ , ἆρά ποτ’ ἔσται ἀποτείσασθαι τὸν καὶ θεοῖς ἐχθρὸν καὶ ἀνθρώποις , ὃς διατελεῖ μισῶν , οὐκ ἤν τίς τι αὐτὸν ἀδικῇ , ἀλλ’ ἐάν τινα ὑποπτεύσῃ βελτίονα αὑτοῦ εἶναι .
Because, Cyrus, on account of the outrage I had suffered and my consequent resentment, my soul was not looking out consistently for the safest course but was pregnant with this thought, whether it would ever be in my power to get revenge upon that enemy of gods and men, who cherishes an implacable hatred not so much toward the man who does him wrong as toward the one whom he suspects of being better than himself.


5.4.36
2808
τοιγαροῦν οἶμαι αὐτὸς πονηρὸς ὢν πᾶσι πονηροτέροις αὑτοῦ συμμάχοις χρήσεται .
Therefore, since he is such a scoundrel himself, he will find no supporters but those who are worse scoundrels than himself.


5.4.36
2809
ἐὰν δέ τις ἄρα καὶ βελτίων αὐτοῦ φανῇ , θάρρει , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , οὐδέν σε δεήσει τῷ ἀγαθῷ ἀνδρὶ μάχεσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνος τοῦτο ἀρκέσει μηχανώμενος , ἕως ἂν ἕλῃ τὸν ἑαυτοῦ βελτίονα .
But if some one of them by any chance be found better than he, never fear, Cyrus, that you will have to fight that good man; but he will take care of him, scheming unceasingly until he has got rid of that man who is better than himself.


5.4.36
2810
τοῦ μέντοι ἐμὲ ἀνιᾶν καὶ σὺν πονηροῖς ῥᾳδίως οἶμαι κρείττων ἔσται .
But as for me, he will, I think, even with worthless fellows easily be strong enough to harass me.


5.4.37
2811
ἀκούσαντι ταῦτα τῷ Κύρῳ ἔδοξεν ἄξια ἐπιμελείας λέγειν ·
As Cyrus heard this, it seemed to him that Gadatas said something worthy of consideration;


5.4.37
2812
καὶ εὐθὺς εἶπε ·
so he answered at once:


5.4.37
2813
τί οὖν , ἔφη , ὦ Γαδάτα , οὐχὶ τὰ μὲν τείχη φυλακῇ ἐχυρὰ ἐποιήσαμεν , ὅπως ἄν σοι σῷα ᾖ χρῆσθαι ἀσφαλῶς , ὁπόταν εἰς αὐτὰ ἴῃς ·
Pray then, Gadatas, said he, let us make the fortifications strong with garrisons and safe, that you may have confidence in their security, whenever you go into them;


5.4.37
2814
αὐτὸς δὲ σὺν ἡμῖν στρατεύῃ , ἵνα ἢν οἱ θεοὶ ὥσπερ νῦν σὺν ἡμῖν ὦσιν , οὗτος σὲ φοβῆται , ἀλλὰ μὴ σὺ τοῦτον ;
and then do you take the field with us yourself so that, if the gods continue on our side as they now are, he may be afraid of you, not you of him.


5.4.37
2815
ὅ τι δὲ ἡδύ σοι ὁρᾶν τῶν σῶν ἢ ὅτῳ συνὼν χαίρεις , ἔχων σὺν σαυτῷ πορεύου .
And bring with you whatsoever of yours you like to look at or to have with you, and come.


5.4.37
2816
καὶ σύ τ’ ἂν ἐμοί , ὥς γ’ ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , πάνυ χρήσιμος εἴης , ἐγώ τε σοὶ ὅσα ἂν δύνωμαι πειράσομαι .
It seems to me, too, that you would be very useful to me, and I shall try to be the same to you, as far as I can.


5.4.38
2817
ἀκούσας ταῦτα ὁ Γαδάτας ἀνέπνευσέ τε καὶ εἶπεν ·
On hearing this, Gadatas breathed more freely and said:


5.4.38
2818
ἆρ’ οὖν , ἔφη , δυναίμην ἂν συσκευασάμενος φθάσαι πρίν σε ἐξιέναι ;
Could I get things ready before you go?


5.4.38
2819
βούλομαι γάρ τοι , ἔφη , καὶ τὴν μητέρα ἄγειν μετ’ ἐμαυτοῦ .
For, you see, I should like to take my mother with me.


5.4.38
2820
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , φθάσεις μέντοι .
Yes, by Zeus, he answered, you will have plenty of time; for I will hold back until you say it is all right.


5.4.39
2821
ἐγὼ γὰρ ἐπισχήσω ἔστ’ ἂν φῇς καλῶς ἔχειν .
Accordingly, Gadatas went away in company with Cyrus


5.4.39
2822
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Γαδάτας ἀπελθὼν φύλαξι μὲν τὰ τείχη σὺν Κύρῳ ὠχυρώσατο , συνεσκευάσατο δὲ πάντα ὁπόσοις ἂν οἶκος μέγας καλῶς οἰκοῖτο .
and strengthened the forts with garrisons and then packed up everything that a great house might need for comfort.


5.4.39
2823
ἤγετο δὲ καὶ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ τῶν τε πιστῶν οἷς ἥδετο καὶ ὧν ἠπίστει πολλούς , ἀναγκάσας τοὺς μὲν καὶ γυναῖκας ἄγειν , τοὺς δὲ καὶ ἀδελφούς , ὡς δεδεμένους τούτοις κατέχοι αὐτούς .
And he brought with him many of his own loved and trusted friends and many also of those whom he distrusted, compelling some to bring along their wives, others their brothers and sisters, in order that he might keep them under control, when bound by such ties.


5.4.40
2824
καὶ τὸν μὲν Γαδάταν εὐθὺς ὁ Κῦρος ἐν τοῖς περὶ αὑτὸν ᾔει ἔχων καὶ ὁδῶν φραστῆρα καὶ ὑδάτων καὶ χιλοῦ καὶ σίτου , ὡς εἴη ἐν τοῖς ἀφθονωτάτοις στρατοπεδεύεσθαι .
And from the first Cyrus  kept Gadatas among those about him as he marched, to give him information in regard to roads and water, fodder and provisions, so that they might be able to camp where things were most abundant.


5.4.41
2825
ἐπεὶ δὲ πορευόμενος καθεώρα τὴν τῶν Βαβυλωνίων πόλιν καὶ ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ ἡ ὁδὸς ἣν ᾔει παρ’ αὐτὸ τὸ τεῖχος φέρειν , καλέσας τὸν Γωβρύαν καὶ τὸν Γαδάταν ἠρώτα εἰ εἴη ἄλλη ὁδός , ὥστε μὴ πάνυ ἐγγὺς τοῦ τείχους ἄγειν .
And when, as he proceeded, he came in sight of the city of Babylon  and it seemed to him that the road which he was following led close by the walls, he called Gobryas and Gadatas to him and asked if there were not another road, so that they need not march right by the wall.


5.4.42
2826
καὶ ὁ Γωβρύας εἶπεν ·
Yes, sire, answered Gobryas;


5.4.42
2827
εἰσὶ μέν , ὦ δέσποτα , καὶ πολλαὶ ὁδοί ·
in fact, there are many roads;


5.4.42
2828
ἀλλ’ ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη , ᾠόμην καὶ βούλεσθαι ἄν σε νῦν ὅτι ἐγγυτάτω τῆς πόλεως ἄγειν , ἵνα καὶ ἐπιδείξαις αὐτῷ ὅτι τὸ στράτευμά σου ἤδη πολύ τέ ἐστι καὶ καλόν ·
but I supposed that you would surely wish to march as near to the city as possible, in order to show him that your army is now large and imposing;


5.4.42
2829
ἐπειδὴ καὶ ὅτε ἔλαττον εἶχες προσῆλθές τε πρὸς αὐτὸ τὸ τεῖχος καὶ ἐθεᾶτο ἡμᾶς οὐ πολλοὺς ὄντας ·
for even when you had a smaller force, you came right up to the very walls and he saw that we had no great numbers.


5.4.42
2830
νῦν δὲ εἰ καὶ παρεσκευασμένος τί ἐστιν , ὥσπερ πρὸς σὲ εἶπεν ὅτι παρασκευάζοιτο ὡς μαχούμενός σοι , οἶδ’ ὅτι ἰδόντι αὐτῷ τὴν σὴν δύναμιν πάλιν ἀπαρασκευαστότατα τὰ αὑτοῦ φανεῖται .
So now, even if he really is to some extent prepared (for he sent word to you that he was making preparations to fight you), I am sure that, when he sees your forces, his own will again seem to him extremely ill-prepared.


5.4.43
2831
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος πρὸς ταῦτα εἶπε ·
And Cyrus said in answer


5.4.43
2832
δοκεῖς μοι , ὦ Γωβρύα , θαυμάζειν ὅτι ἐν ᾧ μὲν χρόνῳ πολὺ μείονα ἔχων στρατιὰν ἦλθον , πρὸς αὐτὸ τὸ τεῖχος προσῆγον ·
You seem to be surprised, Gobryas,


5.4.43
2833
νῦν δ’ ἐπεὶ πλείονα δύναμιν ἔχω , οὐκ ἐθέλω ὑπ’ αὐτὰ τὰ τείχη ἄγειν .
that I marched right up to the walls when I came with a much smaller army, whereas now with a larger force I am unwilling to march close up under the walls.


5.4.44
2834
ἀλλὰ μὴ θαύμαζε ·
But do not be surprised;


5.4.44
2835
οὐ γὰρ τὸ αὐτό ἐστι προσάγειν τε καὶ παράγειν .
for marching up to and marching by are not the same thing.


5.4.44
2836
προσάγουσι μὲν γὰρ πάντες οὕτω ταξάμενοι ὡς ἂν ἄριστοι εἶεν μάχεσθαι καὶ ἀπάγουσι δὲ οἱ σώφρονες ᾗ ἂν ἀσφαλέστατα , οὐχ ᾗ ἂν τάχιστα ἀπέλθοιεν , παριέναι δὲ ἀνάγκη ἐστὶν ἐκτεταμέναις μὲν ταῖς ἁμάξαις , ἀνειρμένοις δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις σκευοφόροις ἐπὶ πολύ ·
For every one leads up in the order best for fighting and the wise also retreat in the safest possible way, and not in the quickest,


5.4.45
2837
ταῦτα δὲ πάντα δεῖ προκεκαλύφθαι τοῖς ὁπλοφόροις καὶ μηδαμῇ τοῖς πολεμίοις γυμνὰ ὅπλων τὰ σκευοφόρα φαίνεσθαι .
but an army must needs march by with the wagons in an extended line and with the rest of the baggage vans in a long train. And these must all be covered by soldiers, and the enemy must never see the baggage wagons unprotected by arms.


5.4.46
2838
ἀνάγκη οὖν οὕτω πορευομένων ἐπὶ λεπτὸν καὶ ἀσθενὲς τὸ μάχιμον τετάχθαι ·
When people march in this way, therefore, they necessarily have the fighting men drawn out in a thin, weak line.


5.4.46
2839
εἰ οὖν βούλοιντο ἁθρόοι ἐκ τοῦ τείχους προσπεσεῖν πῃ , ὅπῃ προσμείξειαν , πολὺ ἂν ἐρρωμενέστεροι συμμιγνύοιεν τῶν παριόντων ·
If, then, the enemy should ever decide to sally out in a compact body from their walls, on whichever part they came to close quarters they would close with much greater force than those have who are marching by.


5.4.47
2840
καὶ τοῖς μὲν ἐπὶ μακρὸν πορευομένοις μακραὶ καὶ αἱ ἐπιβοήθειαι , τοῖς δ’ ἐκ τοῦ τείχους βραχὺ πρὸς τὸ ἐγγὺς καὶ προσδραμεῖν καὶ πάλιν ἀπελθεῖν .
Then, too, those who are marching in a long column must be a long distance from their supports, while the townspeople have but a short way to go to make a dash on a force near them and again retire.


5.4.48
2841
ἢν δὲ μὴ μεῖον ἀπέχοντες παρίωμεν ἢ ἐφ’ ὅσον καὶ νῦν ἐκτεταμένοι πορευόμεθα , τὸ μὲν πλῆθος κατόψονται ἡμῶν ·
On the other hand, if we march by at a distance from the walls not less than that at which we are now proceeding with our long extended line, they will have a view of our full numbers, to be sure,


5.4.48
2842
ὑπὸ δὲ τῶν παρυφασμένων ὅπλων πᾶς ὄχλος δεινὸς φαίνεται .
but behind the fringe of arms the whole host will look terrible.


5.4.49
2843
ἂν δ’ οὖν τῷ ὄντι ἐπεξίωσί πῃ , ἐκ πολλοῦ προορῶντες αὐτοὺς οὐκ ἂν ἀπαράσκευοι λαμβανοίμεθα .
Be that as it may, if they should really make a sally at any point, we should see them a long way off and not be caught unprepared;


5.4.49
2844
μᾶλλον δέ , ὦ ἄνδρες , ἔφη , οὐδ’ ἐπιχειρήσουσιν , ὁπόταν πρόσω δέῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ἀπιέναι , ἂν μὴ τῷ ὅλῳ ὑπολάβωσι τοῦ παντὸς κρείττους εἶναι ·
or rather, I should say, friends, they will not so much as make the attempt when they have to go far from their walls, unless they judge that the whole of their force is superior to the whole of ours; for a retreat is a perilous thing for them.


5.4.50
2845
φοβερὰ γὰρ ἡ ἀποχώρησις .
When he said this, those present agreed that what he said was right,


5.4.50
2846
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτ’ εἶπεν , ἔδοξέ τε ὀρθῶς τοῖς παροῦσι λέγειν καὶ ἦγεν ὁ Γωβρύας ὥσπερ ἐκέλευσε .
and Gobryas led the way as he had directed.


5.4.50
2847
παραμειβομένου δὲ τὴν πόλιν τοῦ στρατεύματος αἰεὶ τὸ ὑπολειπόμενον ἰσχυρότερον ποιούμενος ἀπεχώρει .
And as the army marched by the city, he constantly kept the part just passing the city the strongest, and so moved on.


5.4.51
2848
ἐπεὶ δὲ πορευόμενος οὕτως ἐν ταῖς γιγνομέναις ἡμέραις ἀφικνεῖται εἰς τὰ μεθόρια τῶν Σύρων καὶ Μήδων , ἔνθενπερ ὡρμᾶτο , ἐνταῦθα δὴ τρία ὄντα τῶν Σύρων φρούρια , ἓν μὲν αὐτὸς τὸ ἀσθενέστατον βίᾳ προσβαλὼν ἔλαβε , τὼ δὲ δύο φρουρίω φοβῶν μὲν Κῦρος , πείθων δὲ Γαδάτας ἔπεισε παραδοῦναι τοὺς φυλάττοντας .
Thus he continued his march and came in the usual number of days to the place on the boundaries between Media and Syria  from which he had originally started. Of the three forts of the Syrians there, Cyrus  in person assaulted one, the weakest, and took it by storm; of the other two, Cyrus , by intimidation, brought the garrison of the one to surrender, and Gadatas, by persuasion, that of the other.


5.5.1
2849
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα διεπέπρακτο , πέμπει πρὸς Κυαξάρην καὶ ἐπέστειλεν αὐτῷ ἥκειν ἐπὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον , ὅπως περὶ τῶν φρουρίων ὧν εἰλήφεσαν βουλεύσαιντο ὅ τι χρήσαιντο , καὶ ὅπως θεασάμενος τὸ στράτευμα καὶ περὶ τῶν ἄλλων σύμβουλος γίγνοιτο ὅ τι δοκοίη ἐκ τούτου πράττειν ·
When this had been accomplished, he sent to Cyaxares and requested him to come to camp to hold a council of war concerning the disposition to be made of the forts which they had captured, and, after reviewing the army, to advise what steps he thought they ought to take next for the future conduct of the war.


5.5.1
2850
ἐὰν δὲ κελεύῃ , εἰπέ , ἔφη , ὅτι ἐγὼ ἂν ὡς ἐκεῖνον ἰοίην συστρατοπεδευσόμενος .
But if he bids me, said he, tell him that I would come and join camps with him.


5.5.2
2851
ὁ μὲν δὴ ἄγγελος ᾤχετο ταῦτ’ ἀπαγγελῶν .
Accordingly, the messenger went away to deliver this message.


5.5.2
2852
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐν τούτῳ ἐκέλευσε τὴν τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου σκηνήν , ἣν Κυαξάρῃ οἱ Μῆδοι ἐξεῖλον , ταύτην κατασκευάσαι ὡς βέλτιστα τῇ τε ἄλλῃ κατασκευῇ ἣν εἶχον καὶ τῷ γυναῖκα εἰσαγαγεῖν εἰς τὸν γυναικῶνα τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ σὺν ταύτῃ τὰς μουσουργούς , αἵπερ ἐξῃρημέναι ἦσαν Κυαξάρῃ .
Meanwhile Cyrus had given orders to bring out the tent of the Assyrian king which the Medes had selected for Cyaxares, to make it ready with all kinds of furnishings, and to conduct into the women’s apartments of the tent the woman and with her the music-girls, who had been selected for Cyaxares. And this was done.


5.5.3
2853
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἔπραττον .
When the envoy to Cyaxares had delivered his message,


5.5.3
2854
ὁ δὲ πεμφθεὶς πρὸς τὸν Κυαξάρην ἐπεὶ ἔλεξε τὰ ἐντεταλμένα , ἀκούσας αὐτοῦ ὁ Κυαξάρης ἔγνω βέλτιον εἶναι τὸ στράτευμα μένειν ἐν τοῖς μεθορίοις .
Cyaxares gave it his attention and decided that it was better for the army to stay at the frontier.


5.5.3
2855
καὶ γὰρ οἱ Πέρσαι οὓς μετεπέμψατο ὁ Κῦρος ἧκον ·
And there was the more reason, for the Persians whom Cyrus had sent for had come


5.5.3
2856
ἦσαν δὲ μυριάδες τέτταρες τοξοτῶν καὶ πελταστῶν .
— forty thousand bowmen and peltasts.


5.5.4
2857
ὁρῶν οὖν καὶ τούτους σινομένους πολλὰ τὴν Μηδικήν , τούτων ἂν ἐδόκει ἥδιον ἀπαλλαγῆναι ἢ ἄλλον ὄχλον εἰσδέξασθαι .
And as he saw that these were a severe drain on the Median land, it seemed to him more desirable to get rid of the present army than to admit another host.


5.5.4
2858
ὁ μὲν δὴ ἐκ Περσῶν ἄγων τὸν στρατὸν ἐρόμενος τὸν Κυαξάρην κατὰ τὴν Κύρου ἐπιστολὴν εἴ τι δέοιτο τοῦ στρατοῦ , ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἔφη δεῖσθαι , αὐθημερόν , ἐπεὶ ἤκουσε παρόντα Κῦρον , ᾤχετο πρὸς αὐτὸν ἄγων τὸ στράτευμα .
So when the officer in command of the reinforcements from Persia inquired of Cyaxares, in accordance with the instructions he had from Cyrus, whether he had any need of his army, he said No; and so this general went that same day at the head of his forces to Cyrus, for he heard that Cyrus was in that neighbourhood.


5.5.5
2859
ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης ἐπορεύετο τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ σὺν τοῖς παραμείνασιν ἱππεῦσι Μήδων ·
On the following day Cyaxares set out with the Median cavalry who had stayed with him,


5.5.5
2860
ὡς δ’ ᾔσθετο ὁ Κῦρος προσιόντα αὐτόν , λαβὼν τούς τε τῶν Περσῶν ἱππέας , πολλοὺς ἤδη ὄντας , καὶ τοὺς Μήδους πάντας καὶ τοὺς Ἀρμενίους καὶ τοὺς Ὑρκανίους καὶ τῶν ἄλλων συμμάχων τοὺς εὐιπποτάτους τε καὶ εὐοπλοτάτους ἀπήντα , ἐπιδεικνὺς τῷ Κυαξάρῃ τὴν δύναμιν .
and when Cyrus learned that he was approaching, he went out to meet him with the Persian cavalry, which was now a large body; he took with him also all the Median, Armenian, and Hyrcanian horse, and those of the rest of the allies who were the best mounted and best armed; all these he took with him by way of displaying his forces to Cyaxares.


5.5.6
2861
ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης ἐπεὶ εἶδε σὺν μὲν τῷ Κύρῳ πολλούς τε καὶ καλοὺς καὶ ἀγαθοὺς ἑπομένους , σὺν αὐτῷ δὲ ὀλίγην τε καὶ ὀλίγου ἀξίαν θεραπείαν , ἄτιμόν τι αὐτῷ ἔδοξεν εἶναι καὶ ἄχος αὐτὸν ἔλαβεν .
But when Cyaxares saw many fine, valiant men in the company of Cyrus, while his own escort was small and of little worth, he thought it a thing dishonourable, and grief gat hold on him.


5.5.6
2862
ἐπεὶ δὲ καταβὰς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἵππου ὁ Κῦρος προσῆλθεν ὡς φιλήσων αὐτὸν κατὰ νόμον , ὁ Κυαξάρης κατέβη μὲν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἵππου , ἀπεστράφη δέ ·
So when Cyrus dismounted from his horse and came up to him, intending to kiss him according to custom, Cyaxares dismounted from his horse but turned away.


5.5.6
2863
καὶ ἐφίλησε μὲν οὔ , δακρύων δὲ φανερὸς ἦν .
He refused to kiss him and could not conceal his tears.


5.5.7
2864
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ὁ Κῦρος τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους πάντας ἀποστάντας ἐκέλευσεν ἀναπαύεσθαι ·
Thereupon Cyrus bade all the rest withdraw and wait.


5.5.7
2865
αὐτὸς δὲ λαβόμενος τῆς δεξιᾶς τοῦ Κυαξάρου καὶ ἀπαγαγὼν αὐτὸν τῆς ὁδοῦ ἔξω ὑπὸ φοίνικάς τινας , τῶν τε Μηδικῶν πίλων ὑποβαλεῖν ἐκέλευσεν αὐτῷ καὶ καθίσας αὐτὸν καὶ παρακαθεζόμενος εἶπεν ὧδε .
And he himself caught Cyaxares by the hand, led him to the shade of some palm-trees away from the road, ordered some Median rugs to be spread for him, and begged him to be seated; then sitting down beside him, he spoke as follows:


5.5.8
2866
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , ὦ θεῖε , τί μοι ὀργίζῃ καὶ τί χαλεπὸν ὁρῶν οὕτω χαλεπῶς φέρεις ;
In the name of all the gods, uncle, said he, tell me why you are angry with me; and what do you find wrong that you take it so amiss?


5.5.8
2867
ἐνταῦθα δὴ ὁ Κυαξάρης ἀπεκρίνατο ·
Cyaxares then made answer:


5.5.8
2868
ὅτι , ὦ Κῦρε , δοκῶν γε δὴ ἐφ’ ὅσον ἀνθρώπων μνήμη ἐφικνεῖται καὶ τῶν πάλαι προγόνων καὶ πατρὸς βασιλέως πεφυκέναι καὶ αὐτὸς βασιλεὺς νομιζόμενος εἶναι , ἐμαυτὸν μὲν ὁρῶ οὕτω ταπεινῶς καὶ ἀναξίως ἐλαύνοντα , σὲ δὲ τῇ ἐμῇ θεραπείᾳ καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ δυνάμει μέγαν τε καὶ μεγαλοπρεπῆ παρόντα .
Because, Cyrus, while I am supposed to be the scion of a royal father and of a line of ancestors who were kings of old as far back as the memory of man extends, and while I am called a king myself, still I see myself riding along with a mean and unworthy equipage, while you come before me great and magnificent in the eyes of my own retinue as well as the rest of your forces.


5.5.9
2869
καὶ ταῦτα χαλεπὸν μὲν οἶμαι καὶ ὑπὸ πολεμίων παθεῖν , πολὺ δ’ , ὦ Ζεῦ , χαλεπώτερον ὑφ’ ὧν ἥκιστα ἐχρῆν ταῦτα πεπονθέναι .
And this I think it a hard thing to suffer even at the enemy’s hands and much harder, O Zeus, at the hands of those from whom I should least of all expect such treatment.


5.5.9
2870
ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ δοκῶ δεκάκις ἂν κατὰ τῆς γῆς καταδῦναι ἥδιον ἢ ὀφθῆναι οὕτω ταπεινὸς καὶ ἰδεῖν τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἐμοῦ ἀμελήσαντας καὶ ἐπεγγελῶντας ἐμοί .
For I think I should rather ten times sink into the earth than be seen so humiliated and see my own men disregarding me and laughing at me;


5.5.9
2871
οὐ γὰρ ἀγνοῶ τοῦτο , ἔφη , ὅτι οὐ σύ μου μόνον μείζων εἶ , ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ ἐμοὶ δοῦλοι ἰσχυρότεροι ἐμοῦ ὑπαντιάζουσί μοι καὶ κατεσκευασμένοι εἰσὶν ὥστε δύνασθαι ποιῆσαι μᾶλλον ἐμὲ κακῶς ἢ παθεῖν ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ .
for I am not ignorant of the fact not only that you are greater than I, but also that even my vassals come to meet me more powerful than I am myself and well enough equipped to do more harm to me than I can do to them.


5.5.10
2872
καὶ ἅμα ταῦτα λέγων πολὺ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐκρατεῖτο ὑπὸ τῶν δακρύων , ὥστε καὶ τὸν Κῦρον ἐπεσπάσατο ἐμπλησθῆναι δακρύων τὰ ὄμματα .
And as he said this he was still more violently overcome with weeping, so that he affected Cyrus, too, till his eyes filled with tears.


5.5.10
2873
ἐπισχὼν δὲ μικρὸν ἔλεξε τοιάδε ὁ Κῦρος .
But after pausing for a moment Cyrus answered him as follows:


5.5.10
2874
ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μέν , ὦ Κυαξάρη , οὔτε λέγεις ἀληθῆ οὔτε ὀρθῶς γιγνώσκεις , εἰ οἴει τῇ ἐμῇ παρουσίᾳ Μήδους κατεσκευάσθαι ὥστε ἱκανοὺς εἶναι σὲ κακῶς ποιεῖν ·
Well, Cyaxares, in this you do not speak truly nor do you judge correctly, if you think that by my presence the Medes have been put in a position to do you harm;


5.5.11
2875
τὸ μέντοι σε θυμοῦσθαι καὶ φοβεῖσθαι οὐ θαυμάζω .
but that you are angered and threaten them gives me no surprise.


5.5.11
2876
εἰ μέντοι γε δικαίως ἢ ἀδίκως αὐτοῖς χαλεπαίνεις , παρήσω τοῦτο ·
However, whether your anger against them is just or unjust, I will not stop to inquire;


5.5.11
2877
οἶδα γὰρ ὅτι βαρέως ἂν φέροις ἀκούων ἐμοῦ ἀπολογουμένου ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ·
for I know that you would be offended to hear me speak in their defence.


5.5.11
2878
τὸ μέντοι ἄνδρα ἄρχοντα πᾶσιν ἅμα χαλεπαίνειν τοῖς ἀρχομένοις , τοῦτο ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ μέγα ἁμάρτημα εἶναι .
To me, however, it seems a serious error for a ruler to be angry with all his subjects at the same time;


5.5.11
2879
ἀνάγκη γὰρ διὰ τὸ πολλοὺς μὲν φοβεῖν πολλοὺς ἐχθροὺς ποιεῖσθαι , διὰ δὲ τὸ πᾶσιν ἅμα χαλεπαίνειν πᾶσιν αὐτοῖς ὁμόνοιαν ἐμβάλλειν .
for, as a matter of course, threatening many makes many enemies, and being angry with all at the same time inspires them all with a common sense of wrong.


5.5.12
2880
ὧν ἕνεκα , εὖ ἴσθι , ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀπέπεμπον ἄνευ ἐμαυτοῦ τούτους , φοβούμενος μή τι γένοιτο διὰ τὴν σὴν ὀργὴν ὅ τι πάντας ἡμᾶς λυπήσοι .
It was for this reason, let me assure you, that I did not let them come back without me, for I was afraid that in consequence of your anger something might happen for which we should all be sorry.


5.5.12
2881
ταῦτα μὲν οὖν σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς ἐμοῦ παρόντος ἀσφαλῶς ἔχει σοι ·
With the help of the gods, therefore, you are secured against that by my presence.


5.5.12
2882
τὸ μέντοι σε νομίζειν ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ ἀδικεῖσθαι , τοῦτο ἐγὼ πάνυ χαλεπῶς φέρω , εἰ ἀσκῶν ὅσον δύναμαι τοὺς φίλους ὡς πλεῖστα ἀγαθὰ ποιεῖν ἔπειτα τ- ἐναντία τούτου δοκῶ ἐξεργάζεσθαι .
As to your supposition that you have been wronged by me — I am exceedingly sorry, if, while I have been striving to the utmost of my ability to do as much good as possible to my friends, I seem after all to be accomplishing just the opposite.


5.5.13
2883
ἀλλὰ γάρ , ἔφη , μὴ οὕτως εἰκῇ ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς αἰτιώμεθα ·
But enough of this; let us not thus idly accuse one another;


5.5.13
2884
ἀλλ’ , εἰ δυνατόν , σαφέστατα κατίδωμεν ποῖόν ἐστι τὸ παρ’ ἐμοῦ ἀδίκημα .
but, if possible, let us examine what sort of wrong it is that has come from me.


5.5.13
2885
καὶ τὴν ἐν φίλοις δικαιοτάτην ὑπόθεσιν ἔχω ὑποτιθέναι ·
I am ready to make you a proposal, the fairest that can be made between friends:


5.5.13
2886
ἐὰν γάρ τί σε φανῶ κακὸν πεποιηκώς , ὁμολογῶ ἀδικεῖν ·
if it appear that I have done you harm, I confess that I am in the wrong;


5.5.13
2887
ἐὰν μέντοι μηδὲν φαίνωμαι κακὸν πεποιηκὼς μηδὲ βουληθείς , οὐ καὶ σὺ αὖ ὁμολογήσεις μηδὲν ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ ἀδικεῖσθαι ;
but if it turn out that I have done you no harm and intended none, will you then on your part confess that you have suffered no wrong at my hands?


5.5.14
2888
ἀλλ’ ἀνάγκη , ἔφη .
Nay, I must, said he.


5.5.14
2889
ἐὰν δὲ δὴ καὶ ἀγαθὰ πεπραχώς σοι δῆλος ὦ καὶ προθυμούμενος πρᾶξαι ὡς ἐγὼ πλεῖστα ἐδυνάμην , οὐκ ἂν καὶ ἐπαίνου σοι ἄξιος εἴην μᾶλλον ἢ μέμψεως ;
And if it is demonstrated that I have done you good and have been eager to do as much for you as I could, pray should I not deserve your praise rather than your blame?


5.5.15
2890
δίκαιον γοῦν , ἔφη .
That is only fair, said he.


5.5.15
2891
ἄγε τοίνυν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , σκοπῶμεν τὰ ἐμοὶ πεπραγμένα πάντα καθ’ ἓν ἕκαστον ·
Come, then, said Cyrus, and let us consider all that I have done, all my acts one by one;


5.5.15
2892
οὕτω γὰρ μάλιστα δῆλον ἔσται ὅ τι τε αὐτῶν ἀγαθόν ἐστι καὶ ὅ τι κακόν .
for so it will be most clearly seen what is good and what is bad.


5.5.16
2893
ἀρξώμεθα δ’ , ἔφη , ἐκ τῆσδε τῆς ἀρχῆς , εἰ καὶ σοὶ ἀρκούντως δοκεῖ ἔχειν .
And let us begin, if you think it far enough back, with my assuming this command.


5.5.16
2894
σὺ γὰρ δήπου ἐπεὶ ᾔσθου πολλοὺς πολεμίους ἡθροισμένους , καὶ τούτους ἐπὶ σὲ καὶ τὴν σὴν χώραν ὁρμωμένους , εὐθὺς ἔπεμπες πρός τε τὸ Περσῶν κοινὸν συμμάχους αἰτούμενος καὶ πρὸς ἐμὲ ἰδίᾳ δεόμενος πειρᾶσθαι αὐτὸν ἐμὲ ἐλθεῖν ἡγούμενον , εἴ τινες Περσῶν ἴοιεν .
Now, you remember, when you learned that the enemy had gathered in great numbers and that they were starting against you and your country, you at once sent to the Persian state to ask for help and to me personally to ask me to try to come myself at the head of the forces, if any of the Persians should come.


5.5.16
2895
οὔκουν ἐγὼ ἐπείσθην τε ταῦτα ὑπὸ σοῦ καὶ παρεγενόμην ἄνδρας ἄγων σοι ὡς ἦν δυνατὸν πλείστους τε καὶ ἀρίστους ;
Did I not comply with your request, and did I not come to you leading for your service as many and as valiant men as I could?


5.5.17
2896
ἦλθες γὰρ οὖν , ἔφη .
Yes said he; you certainly came.


5.5.17
2897
ἐν τούτῳ τοίνυν , ἔφη , πρῶτόν μοι εἰπὲ πότερον ἀδικίαν τινά μου πρὸς σὲ κατέγνως ἢ μᾶλλον εὐεργεσίαν ;
Well then, he answered, tell me first whether in this you impute to me any wrong against you or do you not rather count it a benefit towards you?


5.5.17
2898
δῆλον , ἔφη ὁ Κυαξάρης , ὅτι ἔκ γε τούτων εὐεργεσίαν .
Obviously, Cyaxares replied, in that I see a benefit.


5.5.18
2899
τί γάρ , ἔφη , ἐπεὶ οἱ πολέμιοι ἦλθον καὶ διαγωνίζεσθαι ἔδει πρὸς αὐτούς , ἐν τούτῳ κατενόησάς πού με ἢ πόνου ἀποστάντα ἤ τινος κινδύνου φεισάμενον ;
Good, then,  answered Cyrus ;  and when the enemy came and we had to do battle with them, did you then see me ever shirking toil or avoiding danger?    No, by Zeus,  said he;  I certainly did not.


5.5.19
2900
οὐ μὰ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐ μὲν δή .
Furthermore, when with the help of the gods the victory was ours and the enemy retreated,


5.5.19
2901
τί γάρ , ἐπεὶ νίκης γενομένης σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς ἡμετέρας καὶ ἀναχωρησάντων τῶν πολεμίων παρεκάλουν ἐγώ σε ὅπως κοινῇ μὲν αὐτοὺς διώκοιμεν , κοινῇ δὲ τιμωροίμεθα , κοινῇ δὲ εἴ τι καλὸν κ- ἀγαθὸν συμβαίνοι , τοῦτο καρποίμεθα , ἐν τούτοις ἔχεις τινά μου πλεονεξίαν κατηγορῆσαι ;
when I urged you to come in order that we might together pursue them, together take vengeance upon them, and together reap the fruits of victory if any rich spoil should fall to our lot — can you charge me with any selfish purpose in that?


5.5.20
2902
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κυαξάρης πρὸς τοῦτο ἐσίγα ·
To this Cyaxares said nothing.


5.5.20
2903
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος πάλιν ἔλεγεν ὧδε ·
So Cyrus went on again:


5.5.20
2904
ἀλλ’ ἐπεὶ πρὸς τοῦτο σιωπᾶν ἥδιόν σοι ἢ ἀποκρίνασθαι , τόδε γ’ , ἔφη , εἰπὲ εἴ τι ἀδικεῖσθαι ἐνόμισας ὅτι , ἐπεί σοι οὐκ ἀσφαλὲς ἐδόκει εἶναι τὸ διώκειν , σὲ μὲν αὐτὸν ἀφῆκα τοῦ κινδύνου τούτου μετέχειν , ἱππέας δὲ τῶν σῶν συμπέμψαι μοι ἐδεόμην σου ·
Well, seeing that it suits you better to be silent than to reply to this question, tell me whether you thought you were wronged in any way because, when you did not think it safe to pursue, I excused you from a share in that peril and asked you to let some of your cavalry go with me.


5.5.20
2905
εἰ γὰρ καὶ τοῦτο αἰτῶν ἠδίκουν , ἄλλως τε καὶ προπαρεσχηκὼς ἐμαυτόν σοι σύμμαχον , τοῦτ’ αὖ παρὰ σοῦ , ἔφη , ἐπιδεικνύσθω .
For if I did wrong also in asking that, and that, too, when I had previously given you my own services as an ally, that is yours to prove.


5.5.21
2906
ἐπεὶ δ’ αὖ καὶ πρὸς τοῦτο ἐσίγα ὁ Κυαξάρης , ἀλλ’ εἰ μηδὲ τοῦτο , ἔφη , βούλει ἀποκρίνασθαι , σὺ δὲ τ- ἐντεῦθεν λέγε εἴ τι αὖ ἠδίκουν ὅτι σοῦ ἀποκριναμένου ἐμοὶ ὡς οὐκ ἂν βούλοιο , εὐθυμουμένους ὁρῶν Μήδους , τούτου παύσας αὐτοὺς ἀναγκάζειν κινδυνεύσοντας ἰέναι , εἴ τι αὖ σοι δοκῶ τοῦτο χαλεπὸν ποιῆσαι ὅτι ἀμελήσας τοῦ ὀργίζεσθαί σοι ἐπὶ τούτοις πάλιν ᾔτουν σε οὗ ᾔδη οὔτε σοὶ μεῖον ὂν δοῦναι οὐδὲν οὔτε ῥᾷον Μήδοις ἐπιταχθῆναι ·
And as Cyaxares again said nothing, Cyrus resumed:


5.5.21
2907
τὸν γὰρ βουλόμενον δήπου ἕπεσθαι ᾔτησά σε δοῦναί μοι .
Well, seeing that you do not choose to answer that either, please tell me then if I did you wrong in the next step I took: when you answered that you saw that the Medes were enjoying themselves and that you would not be willing to disturb their pleasures and oblige them to go off into dangers, then, far from being angry with you for that, I asked you again for a favour than which, as I knew, nothing was less for you to grant or easier for you to require of the Medes: I asked you, as you will remember, to allow any one who would to follow me. Was there anything unfair, think you, in that?


5.5.22
2908
οὐκοῦν τούτου τυχὼν παρὰ σοῦ οὐδὲν ἦν , εἰ μὴ τούτους πείσαιμι .
Well then, when I had obtained this concession from you, it amounted to nothing, unless I were to gain their consent.


5.5.22
2909
ἐλθὼν οὖν ἔπειθον αὐτοὺς καὶ οὓς ἔπεισα τούτους ἔχων ἐπορευόμην σοῦ ἐπιτρέψαντος .
So I went to see if I could get their consent; and those whom I persuaded I took with me, by your permission, on my expedition.


5.5.22
2910
εἰ δὲ τοῦτο αἰτίας ἄξιον νομίζεις , οὐδ’ ὅ τι ἂν διδῷς , ὡς ἔοικε , παρὰ σοῦ δέχεσθαι ἀναίτιόν ἐστιν .
But if you think that deserving of blame, then, no matter what you may offer, one may not, it seems, accept it from you without blame.


5.5.23
2911
οὐκοῦν ἐξωρμήσαμεν οὕτως ·
Thus, then, we started;


5.5.23
2912
ἐπειδὴ δ’ ἐξήλθομεν , τί ἡμῖν πεπραγμένον οὐ φανερόν ἐστιν ;
and does not every one know what we did when we were gone?


5.5.23
2913
οὐ τὸ στρατόπεδον ἥλωκε τῶν πολεμίων ;
Did we not capture the enemy’s camp?


5.5.23
2914
οὐ τεθνᾶσι πολλοὶ τῶν ἐπὶ σὲ ἐλθόντων ;
Are not many of those who came against you slain?


5.5.23
2915
ἀλλὰ μὴν τῶν γε ζώντων ἐχθρῶν πολλοὶ μὲν ὅπλων ἐστέρηνται , πολλοὶ δὲ ἵππων ·
Aye, and of the enemy still alive many have been deprived of their arms; many others of their horses;


5.5.23
2916
χρήματά γε μὴν τὰ τῶν φερόντων καὶ ἀγόντων τὰ σὰ πρόσθεν νῦν ὁρᾷς τοὺς σοὺς φίλους καὶ ἔχοντας καὶ ἄγοντας , τὰ μὲν σοί , τὰ δ’ αὖ τοῖς ὑπὸ τὴν σὴν ἀρχήν .
moreover, the belongings of those who before were robbing you and carrying off your property you now see in the hands of your friends and being brought in, some for you, some for those who are under your dominion.


5.5.24
2917
τὸ δὲ πάντων μέγιστον καὶ κάλλιστον , τὴν μὲν σὴν χώραν αὐξανομένην ὁρᾷς , τὴν δὲ τῶν πολεμίων μειουμένην ·
But what is most important and best of all, you see your own territory increasing, that of the enemy diminishing;


5.5.24
2918
καὶ τὰ μὲν τῶν πολεμίων φρούρια ἐχόμενα , τὰ δὲ σὰ τὰ πρότερον εἰς τὴν Σύρων ἐπικράτειαν συντελοῦντα νῦν τ- ἐναντία σοὶ προσκεχωρηκότα ·
you see the enemy’s fortresses in your possession, and your own, which had before all fallen under the Assyrian’s power, now restored again to you.


5.5.24
2919
τούτων δὲ εἴ τι κακόν σοι ἢ εἴ τι μὴ ἀγαθόν σοι μαθεῖν μὲν ἔγωγε βούλεσθαι οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅπως ἂν εἴποιμι ·
Now, I do not know that I can say that I should like to learn whether any one of these results is a bad thing or whether any one is not a good thing for you,


5.5.24
2920
ἀκοῦσαι μέντοι γε οὐδὲν κωλύει .
but at any rate I have no objection to listening to what you have to say. So tell me what your judgment on the question is.


5.5.25
2921
ἀλλὰ λέγε ὅ τι γιγνώσκεις περὶ αὐτῶν .
So tell me what your judgment on the question is.


5.5.25
2922
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κῦρος οὕτως εἰπὼν ἐπαύσατο ·
When he had thus spoken, Cyrus ceased,


5.5.25
2923
ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης ἔλεξε πρὸς ταῦτα τάδε .
and Cyaxares answered as follows:


5.5.25
2924
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Κῦρε , ὡς μὲν ταῦτα ἃ σὺ πεποίηκας κακά ἐστιν οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅπως χρὴ λέγειν ·
Well, Cyrus, I do not see how any one could say that what you have done is bad;


5.5.25
2925
εὖ γε μέντοι , ἔφη , ἴσθι ὅτι ταῦτα τ- ἀγαθὰ τοιαῦτά ἐστιν οἷα ὅσῳ πλείονα φαίνεται , τοσούτῳ μᾶλλον ἐμὲ βαρύνει .
but still, let me tell you, these services of yours are of such a nature that the more numerous they appear to be, the more they burden me.


5.5.26
2926
τήν τε γὰρ χώραν , ἔφη , ἐγὼ ἂν τὴν σὴν ἐβουλόμην τῇ ἐμῇ δυνάμει μείζω ποιεῖν μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν ἐμὴν ὑπὸ σοῦ ὁρᾶν οὕτως αὐξανομένην ·
For as to territory, I should rather extend yours by my power than see mine thus increased by you;


5.5.26
2927
σοὶ μὲν γὰρ ταῦτα ποιοῦντι καλά , ἐμοὶ δέ γέ ἐστί πῃ τ- αὐτὰ ἀτιμίαν φέροντα .
for to you it brings glory to do this, but to me these same things somehow bring disgrace.


5.5.27
2928
καὶ χρήματα οὕτως ἄν μοι δοκῶ ἥδιόν σοι δωρεῖσθαι ἢ παρὰ σοῦ οὕτω λαμβάνειν ὡς σὺ νῦν ἐμοὶ δίδως ·
And as for money, it would be more agreeable for me to bestow it in this way upon you than to receive it from you under such circumstances as those under which you now offer it.


5.5.27
2929
τούτοις γὰρ πλουτιζόμενος ὑπὸ σοῦ καὶ μᾶλλον αἰσθάνομαι οἷς πενέστερος γίγνομαι .
For in being thus enriched by you, I feel even more wherein I am made poorer.


5.5.27
2930
καὶ τούς γ’ ἐμοὺς ὑπηκόους ἰδὼν μικρά γε ἀδικουμένους ὑπὸ σοῦ ἧττον ἂν δοκῶ λυπεῖσθαι ἢ νῦν ὁρῶν ὅτι μεγάλα ἀγαθὰ πεπόνθασιν ὑπὸ σοῦ .
And I think I should be less displeased to see my subjects actually wronged a little by you than to see, as I do, that they have received great benefits from you.


5.5.28
2931
εἰ δέ σοι , ἔφη , ταῦτα δοκῶ ἀγνωμόνως ἐνθυμεῖσθαι , μὴ ἐν ἐμοὶ αὐτὰ ἀλλ’ εἰς σὲ τρέψας πάντα καταθέασαι οἷά σοι φαίνεται .
But, he went on, if it seems to you that it is unreasonable of me to take these things to heart, put yourself in my place and see in what light they appear to you.


5.5.28
2932
τί γὰρ ἄν , εἴ τις κύνας , οὓς σὺ τρέφεις φυλακῆς ἕνεκα σαυτοῦ τε καὶ τῶν σῶν , τούτους θεραπεύων γνωριμωτέρους ἑαυτῷ ἢ σοὶ ποιήσειεν , ἆρ’ ἄν σε εὐφράναι τούτῳ τῷ θεραπεύματι ;
And tell me — if any one should pet your dogs, which you have been training for the protection of yourself and yours, and make them more familiar with himself than with you, would he please you with such petting?


5.5.29
2933
εἰ δὲ τοῦτό σοι δοκεῖ μικρὸν εἶναι , ἐκεῖνο κατανόησον ·
Or if that seems to you a belittling comparison, think on this:


5.5.29
2934
εἴ τις τοὺς σὲ θεραπεύοντας , οὓς σὺ καὶ φρουρᾶς καὶ στρατείας ἕνεκα κέκτησαι , τούτους οὕτω διατιθείη ὥστ’ ἐκείνου μᾶλλον ἢ σοῦ βούλεσθαι εἶναι , ἆρ’ ἂν ἀντὶ ταύτης τῆς εὐεργεσίας χάριν αὐτῷ εἰδείης ;
if any one were to tamper with the attendants that you kept for your body-guard and for service in war, and so dispose them that they would rather be his than yours, would you be grateful to him for such kindness?


5.5.30
2935
τί δέ , ὃ μάλιστα ἄνθρωποι ἀσπάζονταί τε καὶ θεραπεύουσιν οἰκειότατα , εἴ τις τὴν γυναῖκα τὴν σὴν οὕτω θεραπεύσειεν ὥστε φιλεῖν αὐτὴν μᾶλλον ποιήσειεν ἑαυτὸν ἢ σέ , ἆρ’ ἄν σε τῇ εὐεργεσίᾳ ταύτῃ εὐφράναι ;
Again, let us take the object that men love most and most dearly cherish — suppose some one were to court your wife and make her love him more than yourself, would such kindness give you pleasure?


5.5.30
2936
πολλοῦ γ’ ἂν οἶμαι καὶ δέοι ·
Far from it, I think;


5.5.30
2937
ἀλλ’ εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι πάντων ἂν μάλιστα ἀδικοίη σε τοῦτο ποιήσας .
for I am sure that he who should be guilty of such conduct would be doing you the greatest of all injuries.


5.5.31
2938
ἵνα δὲ εἴπω καὶ τὸ μάλιστα τῷ ἐμῷ πάθει ἐμφερές , εἴ τις οὓς σὺ ἤγαγες Πέρσας οὕτω θεραπεύσειεν ὥστε αὐτῷ ἥδιον ἕπεσθαι ἢ σοί , ἆρ’ ἂν φίλον αὐτὸν νομίζοις ;
But to quote an example most nearly akin to my own case — if any one should so treat the Persians whom you have brought here as to make them more glad to follow him than you, would you consider him your friend?


5.5.31
2939
οἶμαι μὲν οὔ , ἀλλὰ πολεμιώτερον ἂν ἢ εἰ πολλοὺς αὐτῶν κατακάνοι .
I trow not; but you would consider him more of an enemy than if he were to slay many of them.


5.5.32
2940
τί δ’ , εἴ τις τῶν σῶν φίλων φιλοφρόνως σου εἰπόντος λαμβάνειν ὁπόσα ἐθέλοι εἶτα τοῦτο ἀκούσας λαβὼν οἴχοιτο ἅπαντα ὁπόσα δύναιτο , καὶ αὐτὸς μέν γε τοῖς σοῖς πλουτοίη , σὺ δὲ μηδὲ μετρίοις ἔχοις χρῆσθαι , ἆρ’ ἂν δύναιο τὸν τοιοῦτον ἄμεμπτον φίλον νομίζειν ;
Or again, if you in your kindness of heart were to tell one of your friends to take whatever of yours he wanted, and if he, accepting your offer, should make off with everything he could and enrich himself with what belonged to you, while you had not even enough left for moderate use, could you consider such a one a blameless friend?


5.5.33
2941
νῦν μέντοι ἐγώ , ὦ Κῦρε , εἰ μὴ ταῦτα ἀλλὰ τοιαῦτα ὑπὸ σοῦ δοκῶ πεπονθέναι .
Well then, Cyrus, it seems to me that your treatment of me has been, if not that, at least something like that;


5.5.33
2942
σὺ γὰρ ἀληθῆ λέγεις ·
for what you say is true:


5.5.33
2943
εἰπόντος ἐμοῦ τοὺς θέλοντας ἄγειν λαβὼν ᾤχου πᾶσάν μου τὴν δύναμιν , ἐμὲ δὲ ἔρημον κατέλιπες ·
I told you to take those who wished to go with you, and off you went with my whole force and left me deserted.


5.5.33
2944
καὶ νῦν ἃ ἔλαβες τῇ ἐμῇ δυνάμει ἄγεις δή μοι καὶ τὴν ἐμὴν χώραν αὔξεις σὺν τῇ ἐμῇ ῥώμῃ ·
And now what you have taken with my forces you bring to me, forsooth, and with my own strength you increase my realm;


5.5.33
2945
ἐγὼ δὲ δοκῶ οὐδὲν συναίτιος ὢν τῶν ἀγαθῶν παρέχειν ἐμαυτὸν ὥσπερ γυνὴ εὖ ποιεῖν , καὶ τοῖς τε ἄλλοις ἀνθρώποις καὶ τοῖσδε τοῖς ἐμοῖς ὑπηκόοις σὺ μὲν ἀνὴρ φαίνῃ , ἐγὼ δ’ οὐκ ἄξιος ἀρχῆς .
and I, it seems, having no share in securing this good fortune, must submit like a mere woman to receive favours, and you are a hero in the eyes of all the world and especially of my subjects here, while I am not considered worthy of my crown.


5.5.34
2946
ταῦτά σοι δοκεῖ εὐεργετήματ’ εἶναι , ὦ Κῦρε ;
Do you think that these are deeds of kindness, Cyrus?


5.5.34
2947
εὖ ἴσθ’ ὅτι εἴ τι ἐμοῦ ἐκήδου , οὐδενὸς ἂν οὕτω με ἀποστερεῖν ἐφυλάττου ὡς ἀξιώματος καὶ τιμῆς .
Let me tell you that if you had any regard for me, there is nothing of which you would be so careful not to rob me as my reputation and my honour.


5.5.34
2948
τί γὰρ ἐμοὶ πλέον τὸ τὴν γῆν πλατύνεσθαι , αὐτὸν δὲ ἀτιμάζεσθαι ;
For what do I gain, if I have my realm extended wide and lose my own honour?


5.5.34
2949
οὐ γάρ τοι ἐγὼ Μήδων ἦρχον διὰ τὸ κρείττων αὐτῶν πάντων εἶναι , ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον διὰ τὸ αὐτοὺς τούτους ἀξιοῦν ἡμᾶς αὑτῶν πάντα βελτίονας εἶναι .
For I was not made king of the Medes because I was more powerful than they all, but rather because they themselves accounted us to be in all things better than themselves.


5.5.35
2950
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἔτι λέγοντος αὐτοῦ ὑπολαβὼν εἶπε ·
By the gods, uncle, said Cyrus, interrupting him before he had finished speaking,


5.5.35
2951
πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , ἔφη , ὦ θεῖε , εἴ τι κ- ἐγώ σοι πρότερον ἐχαρισάμην , καὶ σὺ νῦν ἐμοὶ χάρισαι ὃ ἂν δεηθῶ σου ·
if I have ever done you any favour before, please do me now the favour that I beg of you:


5.5.35
2952
παῦσαι , ἔφη , τὸ νῦν εἶναι μεμφόμενός μοι ·
desist from blaming me for the present,


5.5.35
2953
ἐπειδὰν δὲ πεῖραν ἡμῶν λάβῃς πῶς ἔχομεν πρὸς σέ , ἐὰν μὲν δή σοι φαίνηται τὰ ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ πεπραγμένα ἐπὶ τῷ σῷ ἀγαθῷ πεποιημένα , ἀσπαζομένου τέ μού σε ἀντασπάζου με εὐεργέτην τε νόμιζε , ἐὰν δ’ ἐπὶ θάτερα , τότε μοι μέμφου .
and when you have proof from us how we feel toward you, if it then appears that what I have done was done for your benefit, return my greeting when I greet you and consider me your benefactor; but if it seems the other way, then blame me.


5.5.36
2954
ἀλλ’ ἴσως μέντοι , ἔφη ὁ Κυαξάρης , καλῶς λέγεις ·
Well, said Cyaxares, perhaps you are right after all;


5.5.36
2955
κ- ἐγὼ οὕτω ποιήσω .
I will do so.


5.5.36
2956
τί οὖν ;
Say then, said Cyrus,


5.5.36
2957
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ἦ καὶ φιλήσω σε ;
may I kiss you, too?


5.5.36
2958
εἰ σὺ βούλει , ἔφη .
If you please, said the other.


5.5.36
2959
καὶ οὐκ ἀποστρέψῃ με ὥσπερ ἄρτι ;
And you will not turn away from me, as you did a little while ago?


5.5.36
2960
οὐκ ἀποστρέψομαι , ἔφη .
No, said he.


5.5.36
2961
καὶ ὃς ἐφίλησεν αὐτόν .
So he kissed him.


5.5.37
2962
ὡς δὲ εἶδον οἱ Μῆδοί τε καὶ οἱ Πέρσαι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ( πᾶσι γὰρ ἔμελεν ὅ τι ἐκ τούτων ἔσοιτο ) , εὐθὺς ἥσθησάν τε καὶ ἐφαιδρύνθησαν .
And when the Medes and the Persians and the rest saw that, for they were all concerned to see what the outcome would be, they were satisfied and glad.


5.5.37
2963
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος δὲ καὶ ὁ Κυαξάρης ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἡγοῦντο , καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν τῷ Κυαξάρῃ οἱ Μῆδοι εἵποντο ( Κῦρος γὰρ αὐτοῖς οὕτως ἐπένευσεν ) , ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ Κύρῳ οἱ Πέρσαι , οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἐπὶ τούτοις .
Then Cyrus and Cyaxares mounted their horses and led the way, and the Medes followed after Cyaxares (for Cyrus gave them a nod so to do), the Persians fell in behind Cyrus, and the rest behind them.


5.5.38
2964
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀφίκοντο ἐπὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ κατέστησαν τὸν Κυαξάρην εἰς τὴν κατεσκευασμένην σκηνήν , οἷς μὲν ἐτέτακτο παρεσκεύαζον τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τῷ Κυαξάρῃ ·
And when they came to the camp and had lodged Cyaxares in the tent that had been made ready for him, they who had been detailed to do so supplied him with what he needed;


5.5.39
2965
οἱ δὲ Μῆδοι ὅσον χρόνον σχολὴν πρὸ δείπνου ἦγεν ὁ Κυαξάρης ᾖσαν πρὸς αὐτόν , οἱ μὲν καὶ αὐτοὶ καθ’ ἑαυτούς , οἱ δὲ πλεῖστοι ὑπὸ Κύρου ἐγκέλευστοι , δῶρα ἄγοντες , ὁ μέν τις οἰνοχόον καλόν , ὁ δ’ ὀψοποιὸν ἀγαθόν , ὁ δ’ ἀρτοποιόν , ὁ δὲ μουσουργόν , ὁ δ’ ἐκπώματα , ὁ δ’ ἐσθῆτα καλήν ·
and as long as he had leisure before dinner, Cyaxares received calls from the Medes; some of them came of their own accord, but most of them went at the suggestion of Cyrus, taking presents with them — the one a handsome cup-bearer, another a fine cook, another a baker, another a musician, another a cup, another fine raiment;


5.5.39
2966
πᾶς δέ τις ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ ἕν γέ τι ὧν εἰλήφει ἐδωρεῖτο αὐτῷ ·
and every one of them, as a rule, presented him with at least one of the things that he had himself taken,


5.5.40
2967
ὥστε τὸν Κυαξάρην μεταγιγνώσκειν ὡς οὔτε ὁ Κῦρος ἀφίστη αὐτοὺς ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ οὔθ’ οἱ Μῆδοι ἧττόν τι αὐτῷ προσεῖχον τὸν νοῦν ἢ καὶ πρόσθεν .
so that Cyaxares changed his mind and realized that Cyrus  was not alienating their affections from him and that the Medes were no less attentive to him than before.


5.5.41
2968
ἐπεὶ δὲ δείπνου ὥρα ἦν , καλέσας ὁ Κυαξάρης ἠξίου τὸν Κῦρον διὰ χρόνου ἰδόντα αὐτὸν συνδειπνεῖν .
And when the hour for dinner came, Cyaxares summoned Cyrus and asked him, as he had not seen him for a long time, to dine with him.


5.5.41
2969
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἔφη ·
But Cyrus answered:


5.5.41
2970
μὴ δὴ σὺ κέλευε , ὦ Κυαξάρη ·
Please, Cyaxares, do not ask me.


5.5.41
2971
ἢ οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅτι οὗτοι οἱ παρόντες ὑφ’ ἡμῶν πάντες ἐπαιρόμενοι πάρεισιν ;
Do you not see that all these who are here are here at our instance?


5.5.41
2972
οὔκουν καλῶς ἂν πράττοιμι εἰ τούτων ἀμελῶν τὴν ἐμὴν ἡδονὴν θεραπεύειν δοκοίην .
I should not be doing right, then, if I should let them get the impression that I was neglecting them and pursuing my own pleasure.


5.5.41
2973
ἀμελεῖσθαι δὲ δοκοῦντες στρατιῶται οἱ μὲν ἀγαθοὶ πολὺ ἀθυμότεροι γίγνονται , οἱ δὲ πονηροὶ πολὺ ὑβριστότεροι .
For when soldiers think they are being neglected, the good ones become much more despondent and the bad much more presuming.


5.5.42
2974
ἀλλὰ σὺ μέν , ἔφη , ἄλλως τε καὶ ὁδὸν μακρὰν ἥκων δείπνει ἤδη ·
But do you now go to dinner, especially as you have come a long way;


5.5.42
2975
καὶ εἴ τινές σε τιμῶσιν , ἀντασπάζου καὶ εὐώχει αὐτούς , ἵνα σε καὶ θαρρήσωσιν ·
and if any come to pay their respects to you, do you greet them kindly and entertain them well, so that they may feel confidence toward you also.


5.5.42
2976
ἐγὼ δ’ ἀπιὼν ἐφ’ ἅπερ λέγω τρέψομαι .
For my part, I must go and attend to those matters of which I have been speaking to you.


5.5.43
2977
αὔριον δ’ , ἔφη , πρῲ δεῦρ’ ἐπὶ τὰς σὰς θύρας παρέσονται οἱ ἐπικαίριοι , ὅπως βουλευσώμεθα πάντες σὺν σοὶ ὅ τι χρὴ ποιεῖν τὸ ἐκ τοῦδε .
And tomorrow morning my staff-officers will come with me to your headquarters, in order that we may all consult with you about what we should do next.


5.5.43
2978
σὺ δ’ ἡμῖν ἔμβαλε βουλὴν παρὼν περὶ τούτου , πότερον ἔτι δοκεῖ στρατεύεσθαι ἢ καιρὸς ἤδη διαλύειν τὴν στρατιάν .
Do you then and there lay before us the question whether it seems best to continue the campaign or whether it is now time to disband the armies.


5.5.44
2979
ἐκ τούτου ὁ μὲν Κυαξάρης ἀμφὶ δεῖπνον εἶχεν , ὁ δὲ Κῦρος συλλέξας τοὺς ἱκανωτάτους τῶν φίλων καὶ φρονεῖν καὶ συμπράττειν , εἴ τι δέοι , ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
After this Cyaxares attended to his dinner, while Cyrus collected those of his friends who were most able to think and to co-operate with him when occasion demanded, and addressed them as follows:


5.5.44
2980
ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἃ μὲν δὴ πρῶτα ηὐξάμεθα , πάρεστι σὺν θεοῖς .
My friends, with the help of the gods we have, you see, all that we prayed for at the first.


5.5.44
2981
ὅπῃ γὰρ ἂν πορευώμεθα , κρατοῦμεν τῆς χώρας ·
For wherever we go, we are masters of the country.


5.5.44
2982
καὶ μὲν δὴ τοὺς πολεμίους ὁρῶμεν μειουμένους , ἡμᾶς δὲ αὐτοὺς πλείονάς τε καὶ ἰσχυροτέρους γιγνομένους .
What is more, we see the enemy reduced, and ourselves increased in both numbers and strength.


5.5.45
2983
εἰ δὲ ἡμῖν ἔτι ἐθελήσειαν οἱ νῦν προσγεγενημένοι σύμμαχοι παραμεῖναι , πολλῷ ἂν μᾶλλον ἁνύσαι δυναίμεθα καὶ εἴ τι βιάσασθαι καιρὸς καὶ εἴ τι πεῖσαι δέοι .
Now, if the allies we have gained would only stay on with us, we should be able to accomplish much more both by force, when occasion calls for it, and by persuasion, when that is needed;


5.5.45
2984
ὅπως οὖν τὸ μένειν ὡς πλείστοις συνδοκῇ τῶν συμμάχων , οὐδὲν μᾶλλον τοῦτο ἐμὸν ἔργον ἢ καὶ ὑμέτερον μηχανᾶσθαι , ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ ὅταν μάχεσθαι δέῃ , ὁ πλείστους χειρωσάμενος ἀλκιμώτατος δοξάζεται εἶναι , οὕτω καὶ ὅταν πεῖσαι δέῃ , ὁ πλείστους ὁμογνώμονας ἡμῖν ποιήσας οὗτος δικαίως ἂν λεκτικώτατός τε καὶ πρακτικώτατος κρίνοιτο ἂν εἶναι .
and it is not my business a whit more than it is yours to see to it that as many of the allies as possible agree to stay;


5.5.47
2985
μὴ μέντοι ὡς λόγον ἡμῖν ἐπιδειξόμενοι οἷον ἂν εἴποιτε πρὸς ἕκαστον αὐτῶν τοῦτο μελετᾶτε , ἀλλ’ ὡς τοὺς πεπεισμένους ὑφ’ ἑκάστου δήλους ἐσομένους οἷς ἂν πράττωσιν οὕτω παρασκευάζεσθε .
Do not, however, aim at displaying to us the arguments that you will address to each one of them, but set to work with the feeling that those who are persuaded by any one of you will show what they are by what they do.


5.5.48
2986
καὶ ὑμεῖς μέν , ἔφη , τούτων ἐπιμελεῖσθε ·
Do you, therefore, see to this.


5.5.48
2987
ἐγὼ δὲ ὅπως ἂν ἔχοντες τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ὅσον ἂν ἔγωγε δύνωμαι οἱ στρατιῶται περὶ τοῦ στρατεύεσθαι βουλεύωνται τούτου πειράσομαι ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
And I, for my part, will try to see to it, as far as I can, that the soldiers are supplied with all that they need, while they are deliberating about going on with the campaign.



6.1.1
2988
ταύτην μὲν δὴ τὴν ἡμέραν οὕτω διαγαγόντες καὶ δειπνήσαντες ἀνεπαύοντο .
After spending that day in the manner described, they dined and went to rest.


6.1.1
2989
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ πρῲ ἧκον ἐπὶ τὰς Κυαξάρου θύρας πάντες οἱ σύμμαχοι .
Early on the following morning all the allies came to Cyaxares’s headquarters.


6.1.1
2990
ἕως οὖν ὁ Κυαξάρης ἐκοσμεῖτο , ἀκούων ὅτι πολὺς ὄχλος ἐπὶ ταῖς θύραις εἴη , ἐν τούτῳ οἱ φίλοι τῷ Κύρῳ προσῆγον οἱ μὲν Καδουσίους δεομένους αὐτοῦ μένειν , οἱ δὲ Ὑρκανίους , ὁ δέ τις Σάκας , ὁ δέ τις καὶ Γωβρύαν ·
So while Cyaxares was attiring himself (for he heard that there was a large concourse of people at his doors), various friends were presenting the allies to Cyrus.


6.1.1
2991
Ὑστάσπας δὲ Γαδάταν τὸν εὐνοῦχον προσῆγε , δεόμενον τοῦ Κύρου μένειν .
One group brought the Cadusians, who begged him to stay; another, the Hyrcanians; some one brought forward the Sacians, and some one else, Gobryas; Hystaspas presented Gadatas, the eunuch, and he also begged Cyrus to remain.


6.1.2
2992
ἔνθα δὴ ὁ Κῦρος γιγνώσκων ὅτι Γαδάτας πάλαι ἀπωλώλει τῷ φόβῳ μὴ λυθείη ἡ στρατιά , ἐπιγελάσας εἶπεν ·
Then Cyrus, though he realized that Gadatas had for some time been frightened almost to death for fear the army should be disbanded, laughing said:


6.1.2
2993
ὦ Γαδάτα , δῆλος εἶ , ἔφη , ὑπὸ Ὑστάσπου τοῦδε πεπεισμένος ταῦτα γιγνώσκειν ἃ λέγεις .
It is clear, Gadatas, that Hystaspas here has been instigating you to the ideas that you have been expressing.


6.1.3
2994
καὶ ὁ Γαδάτας ἀνατείνας τὰς χεῖρας πρὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀπώμοσεν ἦ μὴν μὴ ὑπὸ τοῦ Ὑστάσπου πεισθεὶς ταῦτα γιγνώσκειν ·
And Gadatas lifting up his hands toward heaven declared on his oath that he had not been influenced by Hystaspas to entertain those feelings.


6.1.3
2995
ἀλλ’ οἶδα , ἔφη , ὅτι ἂν ὑμεῖς ἀπέλθητε , ἔρρει τ- ἐμὰ παντελῶς ·
But I know, said he, that if you and your men go away, it is all over with me.


6.1.3
2996
διὰ ταῦτ’ , ἔφη , καὶ τούτῳ ἐγὼ αὐτὸς διελεγόμην , ἐρωτῶν εἰ εἰδείη τί ἐν νῷ ἔχεις ὑπὲρ τῆς διαλύσεως τοῦ στρατεύματος ποιεῖν .
For this reason, I introduced the subject with him of my own accord, asking him if he knew what it was your intention to do with reference to disbanding the army.


6.1.4
2997
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
I was wrong, then, as it seems, said Cyrus, in accusing our friend Hystaspas.


6.1.4
2998
ἀδίκως ἄρα ἐγὼ Ὑστάσπαν τόνδε καταιτιῶμαι .
Aye, by Zeus, Cyrus, you were indeed, said Hystaspas.


6.1.4
2999
ἀδίκως μέντοι νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Ὑστάσπας , ὦ Κῦρε ·
For I was only remarking to our friend Gadatas that it was not possible for you to go on with the campaign;


6.1.4
3000
ἐγὼ γὰρ ἔλεγον τῷ Γαδάτᾳ τῷδε τοσοῦτον μόνον ὡς οὐχ οἷόν τέ σοι εἴη στρατεύεσθαι , λέγων ὅτι ὁ πατήρ σε μεταπέμποιτο .
for I told him that your father was sending for you.


6.1.4
3001
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος , τί λέγεις ;
What do you mean? said Cyrus.


6.1.5
3002
ἔφη ·
He spoke.


6.1.5
3003
καὶ σὺ τοῦτο ἐτόλμησας ἐξενεγκεῖν , εἴτ’ ἐγὼ ἐβουλόμην εἴτε μή ;
Did you dare to let that get out, whether I would or no?


6.1.5
3004
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ·
Yes, by Zeus, he answered;


6.1.5
3005
ὁρῶ γάρ σε ὑπερεπιθυμοῦντα ἐν Πέρσαις περίβλεπτον περιελθεῖν καὶ τῷ πατρὶ ἐπιδείξασθαι ᾗ ἕκαστα διεπράξω .
for I observe that you are exceedingly anxious to go around in Persia the cynosure of all eyes, and to parade before your father the way you have managed everything here.


6.1.5
3006
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἔφη ·
And do not you wish to go home yourself? asked Cyrus.


6.1.5
3007
σὺ δ’ οὐκ ἐπιθυμεῖς οἴκαδε ἀπελθεῖν ;
No, by Zeus, said Hystaspas;


6.1.5
3008
οὐ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὁ Ὑστάσπας , οὐδ’ ἄπειμί γε , ἀλλὰ μένων στρατηγήσω , ἔστ’ ἂν ποιήσω Γαδάταν τουτονὶ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου δεσπότην .
and I am not going either; but I shall stay here and be general, until I have made our friend Gadatas master of the Assyrian.


6.1.6
3009
οἱ μὲν δὴ τοιαῦτ’ ἔπαιζον σπουδῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους .
Thus half-seriously did they jest with one another.


6.1.6
3010
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ Κυαξάρης σεμνῶς κεκοσμημένος ἐξῆλθε καὶ ἐπὶ θρόνου Μηδικοῦ ἐκαθέζετο .
Meantime, Cyaxares came out in gorgeous attire and seated himself on a Median throne.


6.1.6
3011
ὡς δὲ πάντες συνῆλθον οὓς ἔδει καὶ σιωπὴ ἐγένετο , ὁ Κυαξάρης ἔλεξεν ὧδε .
And when all whose presence was required had assembled and silence prevailed, Cyaxares addressed them as follows:


6.1.6
3012
ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , ἴσως , ἐπειδὴ παρὼν τυγχάνω καὶ πρεσβύτερός εἰμι Κύρου , εἰκὸς ἄρχειν με λόγου .
Friends and allies, since I happen to be here and am older than Cyrus, it is perhaps proper for me to open the conference.


6.1.6
3013
νῦν οὖν δοκεῖ μοι εἶναι καιρὸς περὶ τούτου πρῶτον διαλέγεσθαι πότερον στρατεύεσθαι ἔτι καιρὸς δοκεῖ εἶναι ἢ διαλύειν ἤδη τὴν στρατιάν ·
To begin with, this seems to me to be an opportune time for us to discuss the question whether it is desirable to continue our campaign longer or at once to disband the armies.


6.1.7
3014
λεγέτω οὖν τις , ἔφη , περὶ αὐτοῦ τούτου ᾗ γιγνώσκει .
Any one, therefore, may express his opinion in regard to this question.


6.1.7
3015
ἐκ τούτου πρῶτος μὲν εἶπεν ὁ Ὑρκάνιος ·
Thereupon the Hyrcanian was the first to speak:


6.1.7
3016
ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , οὐκ οἶδα μὲν ἔγωγε εἴ τι δεῖ λόγων ὅπου αὐτὰ τὰ ἔργα δεικνύει τὸ κράτιστον .
Friends and comrades, I, for my part, cannot see what is the use of words, when the facts themselves point out the best course to follow.


6.1.7
3017
πάντες γὰρ ἐπιστάμεθα ὅτι ὁμοῦ μὲν ὄντες πλείω κακὰ τοὺς πολεμίους ποιοῦμεν ἢ πάσχομεν ·
For we all know that when we are together, we do the enemy more harm than they do us;


6.1.7
3018
ὅτε δὲ χωρὶς ἦμεν ἀλλήλων , ἐκεῖνοι ἡμῖν ἐχρῶντο ὡς ἐκείνοις ἦν ἥδιστον , ἡμῖν γε μὴν ὡς χαλεπώτατον .
whereas as long as we were apart, they treated us as was most agreeable to them and most disagreeable to us.


6.1.8
3019
ἐπὶ τούτῳ ὁ Καδούσιος εἶπεν ·
After him the Cadusian spoke:


6.1.8
3020
ἡμεῖς δὲ τί ἂν λέγοιμεν , ἔφη , περὶ τοῦ οἴκαδε ἀπελθόντες ἕκαστοι χωρὶς εἶναι , ὁπότε γε οὐδὲ στρατευομένοις , ὡς ἔοικε , χωρίζεσθαι συμφέρει ;
Why, said he, should we talk about going back home and being separated from one another, since not even in the field, so it seems, is it well for us to get separated?


6.1.8
3021
ἡμεῖς γοῦν οὐ πολὺν χρόνον δίχα τοῦ ὑμετέρου πλήθους στρατευσάμενοι δίκην ἔδομεν ὡς καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐπίστασθε .
At any rate, we not long ago went off on an expedition apart from your main body and paid for it, as you also know.


6.1.9
3022
ἐπὶ τούτῳ Ἀρτάβαζος ὅ ποτε φήσας εἶναι Κύρου συγγενὴς ἔλεξε τοιάδε ·
After him Artabazus, the one who once claimed to be a kinsman of Cyrus, made the following speech:


6.1.9
3023
ἐγὼ δ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Κυαξάρη , τοσοῦτον διαφέρομαι τοῖς πρόσθεν λέγουσιν ·
In one point, Cyaxares, I beg to differ from the previous speakers:


6.1.9
3024
οὗτοι μὲν γάρ φασιν ἔτι δεῖν μένοντας στρατεύεσθαι , ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὅτι ὅτε μὲν οἴκοι ἦν , ἐστρατευόμην ·
they say that we must stay here and carry on the war; but I say that it was when I was at home that I was carrying on wars.


6.1.10
3025
καὶ γὰρ ἐβοήθουν πολλάκις τῶν ἡμετέρων ἀγομένων καὶ περὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων φρουρίων ὡς ἐπιβουλευσομένων πολλάκις πράγματα εἶχον φοβούμενός τε καὶ φρουρῶν ·
And I say truly; for I often had to go to the rescue when our property was being carried off;


6.1.10
3026
καὶ ταῦτ’ ἔπραττον τὰ οἰκεῖα δαπανῶν .
and when our fortresses were threatened, I often had trouble to defend them;


6.1.10
3027
νῦν δ’ ἔχω μὲν τὰ ἐκείνων φρούρια , οὐ φοβοῦμαι δ’ ἐκείνους , εὐωχοῦμαι δὲ τὰ ἐκείνων καὶ πίνω τὰ τῶν πολεμίων .
I lived in constant fear and was kept continually on guard. And I fared thus at my own expense.


6.1.10
3028
ὡς οὖν τὰ μὲν οἴκοι στρατείαν οὖσαν , τάδε δὲ ἑορτήν , ἐμοὶ μὲν οὐ δοκεῖ , ἔφη , διαλύειν τήνδε τὴν πανήγυριν .
But now we are in possession of their forts; I am in fear of them no longer; I revel in the good things of the enemy and drink what is theirs. Therefore, as life at home was warfare, while life here is a feast, I do not care to have this festal gathering break up.


6.1.11
3029
ἐπὶ τούτῳ ὁ Γωβρύας εἶπεν ·
After him Gobryas spoke:


6.1.11
3030
ἐγὼ δ’ , ὦ ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , μέχρι μὲν τοῦδε ἐπαινῶ τὴν Κύρου δεξιάν ·
Friends and comrades, up to the present time I have only praise for Cyrus’s faithfulness;


6.1.11
3031
οὐδὲν γὰρ ψεύδεται ὧν ὑπέσχετο ·
for he has not proved untrue in anything that he has promised.


6.1.11
3032
εἰ δ’ ἄπεισιν ἐκ τῆς χώρας , δῆλον ὅτι ὁ μὲν Ἀσσύριος ἀναπνεύσεται , οὐ τίνων ποινὰς ὧν τε ὑμᾶς ἐπεχείρησεν ἀδικεῖν καὶ ὧν ἐμὲ ἐποίησεν ·
But if he leaves the country now, it is evident that the Assyrian will take new heart without having to pay any penalty for the wrongs he has attempted to do us all and for those which he has done me;


6.1.11
3033
ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν τῷ μέρει ἐκείνῳ πάλιν δώσω δίκην ὅτι ὑμῖν φίλος ἐγενόμην .
and I, in my turn, shall pay to him the penalty for having been your friend.


6.1.12
3034
ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσι Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Last of all Cyrus spoke:


6.1.12
3035
ὦ ἄνδρες , οὐδ’ ἐμὲ λανθάνει ὅτι ἐὰν μὲν διαλύωμεν τὸ στράτευμα , τὰ μὲν ἡμέτερα ἀσθενέστερα γίγνοιτ’ ἄν , τὰ δὲ τῶν πολεμίων πάλιν αὐξήσεται .
I, too, am not unaware, my friends, that if we disband the army, our own situation would become weaker, while the enemy will again gather force.


6.1.12
3036
ὅσοι τε γὰρ αὐτῶν ὅπλα ἀφῄρηνται , ταχὺ ἄλλα ποιήσονται ·
For as many of them as have been deprived of their arms will soon have new ones made,


6.1.12
3037
ὅσοι τε ἵππους ἀπεστέρηνται , ταχὺ πάλιν ἄλλους ἵππους κτήσονται ·
and as many as have been deprived of their horses will soon again procure others,


6.1.12
3038
ἀντὶ δὲ τῶν ἀποθανόντων ἕτεροι ἐφηβήσουσιν καὶ ἐπιγενήσονται ·
while in place of those who have been killed others will have grown to young manhood to take their places.


6.1.12
3039
ὥστε οὐδὲν θαυμαστὸν εἰ πάνυ ἐν τάχει πάλιν ἡμῖν πράγματα παρέχειν δυνήσονται .
And so it will not be at all surprising, if in a very short time they are able again to give us trouble.


6.1.13
3040
τί δῆτα ἐγὼ Κυαξάρην ἐκέλευσα λόγον ἐμβαλεῖν περὶ καταλύσεως τῆς στρατιᾶς ;
Why then do you suppose I suggested to Cyaxares to bring up the question of disbanding the army?


6.1.13
3041
εὖ ἴστε ὅτι φοβούμενος τὸ μέλλον .
Let me tell you; it was because I feared for the future;


6.1.13
3042
ὁρῶ γὰρ ἡμῖν ἀντιπάλους προσιόντας οἷς ἡμεῖς , εἰ ὧδε στρατευσόμεθα , οὐ δυνησόμεθα μάχεσθαι .
for I see foes advancing against us that we shall never be able to cope with, if we go on campaigning in our present fashion.


6.1.14
3043
προσέρχεται μὲν γὰρ δήπου χειμών , στέγαι δὲ εἰ καὶ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς εἰσιν , ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’ οὐχ ἵπποις οὐδὲ θεράπουσιν οὐδὲ τῷ δήμῳ τῶν στρατιωτῶν , ὧν ἄνευ ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἂν δυναίμεθα στρατεύεσθαι ·
For winter is coming, you know; and even granting that we have shelter for ourselves, still, by Zeus, there will be none for our horses or for our attendants or for the rank and file of the army;


6.1.14
3044
τὰ δ’ ἐπιτήδεια ὅπου μὲν ἡμεῖς ἐληλύθαμεν ὑφ’ ἡμῶν ἀνήλωται ·
and without them we could not carry on the war.


6.1.14
3045
ὅποι δὲ μὴ ἀφίγμεθα , διὰ τὸ ἡμᾶς φοβεῖσθαι ἀνακεκομισμένοι εἰσὶν εἰς ἐρύματα , ὥστε αὐτοὶ μὲν ἔχειν , ἡμᾶς δὲ ταῦτα μὴ δύνασθαι λαμβάνειν .
The provisions, wherever we have gone, we have consumed; and where we have not gone, the people out of fear of us have conveyed them into their strongholds, so that they have them themselves, and we cannot get them.


6.1.15
3046
τίς οὖν οὕτως ἀγαθὸς ἢ τίς οὕτως ἰσχυρὸς ὃς λιμῷ καὶ ῥίγει δύναιτ’ ἂν μαχόμενος στρατεύεσθαι ;
Who then is so valiant and so strong that he can prosecute a war while battling against hunger and cold?


6.1.15
3047
εἰ μὲν οὖν οὕτω στρατευσόμεθα , ἐγὼ μέν φημι χρῆναι ἑκόντας ἡμᾶς καταλῦσαι τὴν στρατιὰν μᾶλλον ἢ ἄκοντας ὑπ’ ἀμηχανίας ἐξελαθῆναι .
If, therefore, we propose to go on with the war as we have been doing, I maintain that we ought of our own free will to disband the army, rather than against our will to be driven out of the country by lack of means.


6.1.15
3048
εἰ δὲ βουλόμεθα ἔτι στρατεύεσθαι , τόδ’ ἐγώ φημι χρῆναι ποιεῖν , ὡς τάχιστα πειρᾶσθαι τῶν μὲν ἐκείνων ὀχυρῶν ὡς πλεῖστα παραιρεῖν , ἡμῖν δ’ αὐτοῖς ὡς πλεῖστα ὀχυρὰ ποιεῖσθαι ·
But if we wish to go on with the war, this I say we must do: we must try as quickly as we may to get possession of as many as possible of their forts and build for ourselves as many as we can.


6.1.15
3049
ἐὰν γὰρ ταῦτα γένηται , τὰ μὲν ἐπιτήδεια πλείω ἕξουσιν ὁπότεροι ἂν πλείω δύνωνται λαβόντες ἀποτίθεσθαι , πολιορκήσονται δὲ ὁπότεροι ἂν ἥττους ὦσι .
For, if this is done, that side will have more provisions which is able to get and store up more, and those will be in a state of siege who are weaker.


6.1.16
3050
νῦν δ’ οὐδὲν διαφέρομεν τῶν ἐν τῷ πελάγει πλεόντων ·
As we are, we are not at all different from those who sail the seas:


6.1.16
3051
καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι πλέουσι μὲν ἀεί , τὸ δὲ πεπλευσμένον οὐδὲν οἰκειότερον τοῦ ἀπλεύστου καταλείπουσιν .
they keep on sailing continually, but they leave the waters over which they have sailed no more their own than those over which they have not sailed.


6.1.16
3052
ἐὰν δὲ φρούρια ἡμῖν γένηται , ταῦτα δὴ τοῖς μὲν πολεμίοις ἀλλοτριώσει τὴν χώραν , ἡμῖν δ’ ὑπ’ εὐδίᾳ μᾶλλον πάντ’ ἔσται .
But if we get fortresses, these will alienate the country from the enemy while everything will be smooth sailing for us.


6.1.17
3053
ὃ δ’ ἴσως ἄν τινες ὑμῶν φοβηθεῖεν , εἰ δεήσει πόρρω τῆς ἑαυτῶν φρουρεῖν , μηδὲν τοῦτο ὀκνήσητε .
But perhaps some of you may fear that you will possibly have to do garrison duty far from your own country.


6.1.17
3054
ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ἐπείπερ καὶ ὣς οἴκοθεν ἀποδημοῦμεν , φρουρήσειν ὑμῖν ἀναδεχόμεθα τὰ ἐγγύτατα χωρία τῶν πολεμίων , ὑμεῖς δὲ τὰ πρόσορα ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς τῆς Ἀσσυρίας ἐκεῖνα κτᾶσθε καὶ ἐργάζεσθε .
You need have no hesitation on that score. For since we are far from home in any event, we will take it upon ourselves to do the garrison duty for you in the places nearest to the enemy; but those parts of Assyria which are on your own borders — do you take possession of them and cultivate them.


6.1.18
3055
ἐὰν γὰρ ἡμεῖς τὰ πλησίον αὐτῶν φρουροῦντες δυνώμεθα σῴζεσθαι , ἐν πολλῇ ὑμεῖς εἰρήνῃ ἔσεσθε οἱ τὰ πρόσω αὐτῶν ἔχοντες ·
For if we can safely guard what is near the enemy, you will enjoy a plenitude of peace in possession of the regions far away from them;


6.1.18
3056
οὐ γὰρ οἶμαι δυνήσονται τῶν ἐγγὺς ἑαυτῶν ὄντων ἀμελοῦντες τοῖς πρόσω ὑμῖν ἐπιβουλεύειν .
for they, I trow, will not be able to neglect those who are close to them, while they lay schemes against those who are far away.


6.1.19
3057
ὡς δὲ ταῦτ’ ἐρρήθη , οἵ τε ἄλλοι πάντες ἀνιστάμενοι συμπροθυμήσεσθαι ταῦτ’ ἔφασαν καὶ Κυαξάρης .
After these speeches all the rest, and Cyaxares with them, stood up and declared that they would be glad to co-operate with him in these plans.


6.1.19
3058
Γαδάτας δὲ καὶ Γωβρύας καὶ τεῖχος ἑκάτερος αὐτῶν , ἢν ἐπιτρέψωσιν οἱ σύμμαχοι , τειχιεῖσθαι ἔφασαν , ὥστε καὶ ταῦτα φίλια τοῖς συμμάχοις ὑπάρχειν .
And Gadatas and Gobryas said that if the allies would permit them, they would each of them build a fortress, so that the allies should have these also on their side.


6.1.20
3059
ὁ οὖν Κῦρος ἐπεὶ πάντας ἑώρα προθύμους ὄντας πράττειν ὅσα ἔλεξε , τέλος εἶπεν ·
Accordingly, when Cyrus saw that all were ready to do whatever he suggested, he finally said:


6.1.20
3060
εἰ τοίνυν περαίνειν βουλόμεθα ὅσα φαμὲν χρῆναι ποιεῖν , ὡς τάχιστ’ ἂν δέοι γενέσθαι μηχανὰς μὲν εἰς τὸ καθαιρεῖν τὰ τῶν πολεμίων τείχη , τέκτονας δὲ εἰς τὸ ἡμῖν ὀχυρὰ πυργοῦσθαι .
Well then, if we wish to put into execution what we say we ought to do, we should as soon as possible procure siege-engines to demolish the enemy’s forts, and builders to erect strong towers for our own defence.


6.1.21
3061
ἐκ τούτου ὑπέσχετο ὁ μὲν Κυαξάρης μηχανὴν αὐτὸς ποιησάμενος παρέξειν , ἄλλην δὲ Γαδάτας καὶ Γωβρύας , ἄλλην δὲ Τιγράνης ·
Hereupon Cyaxares promised to have an engine made at his own expense and to put it at their disposal, Gadatas and Gobryas promised another, and Tigranes a third;


6.1.21
3062
αὐτὸς δὲ Κῦρος ἔφη δύο πειράσεσθαι ποιήσασθαι .
Cyrus said that he would himself try to furnish two.


6.1.22
3063
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτ’ ἔδοξεν , ἐπορίζοντο μὲν μηχανοποιούς , παρεσκευάζοντο δ’ ἕκαστοι εἰς τὰς μηχανὰς ὧν ἔδει ·
When this had been agreed upon, they set to work to procure engine-builders and to furnish whatever was needed for the construction of the engines;


6.1.22
3064
ἄνδρας δ’ ἐπέστησαν οἳ ἐδόκουν ἐπιτηδειότατοι εἶναι ἀμφὶ ταῦτ’ ἔχειν .
and they put in charge of it men whom they considered most competent to attend to this work.


6.1.23
3065
Κῦρος δ’ ἐπεὶ ἔγνω ὅτι διατριβὴ ἔσται ἀμφὶ ταῦτα , ἐκάθισε τὸ στράτευμα ἔνθα ᾤετο ὑγιεινότατον εἶναι καὶ εὐπροσοδώτατον ὅσα ἔδει προσκομίζεσθαι ·
Since Cyrus realized that a long time would be required for the execution of these designs, he encamped with his army in a place which he thought was most healthful and most readily accessible for conveying there everything that was necessary.


6.1.23
3066
ὅσα τε ἐρυμνότητος προσεδεῖτο , ἐποιήσατο , ὡς ἐν ἀσφαλεῖ οἱ αἰεὶ μένοντες εἶεν , εἴ ποτε καὶ πρόσω τῇ ἰσχύι ἀποστρατοπεδεύοιτο .
And wherever any point needed further strengthening, he made provision that those who from time to time remained there should be in safety, even if he should be encamped at a distance with the main body of his forces.


6.1.24
3067
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἐρωτῶν οὓς ᾤετο μάλιστα εἰδέναι τὴν χώραν ὁπόθεν ἂν ὡς πλεῖστα ὠφελοῖτο τὸ στράτευμα , ἐξῆγεν ἀεὶ εἰς προνομάς , ἅμα μὲν ὅπως ὅτι πλεῖστα λαμβάνοι τῇ στρατιᾷ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια , ἅμα δ’ ὅπως μᾶλλον ὑγιαίνοιεν καὶ ἰσχύοιεν διαπονούμενοι ταῖς πορείαις , ἅμα δ’ ὅπως ἐν ταῖς ἀγωγαῖς τὰς τάξεις ὑπομιμνῄσκοιντο .
But in addition to this, he made constant inquiry of those whom he thought likely to know about the country from what parts of it the army might get supplies as plentifully as possible and kept leading his men out on foraging expeditions; this he did partly that he might get supplies for the army in as great abundance as possible, partly that they might become inured to labour through these expeditions and might thus be in better health and strength, and partly that by such marches they might be enabled to keep their respective positions in mind.


6.1.25
3068
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κῦρος ἐν τούτοις ἦν .
Thus, then, Cyrus was occupied.


6.1.25
3069
ἐκ δὲ Βαβυλῶνος οἱ αὐτόμολοι καὶ οἱ ἁλισκόμενοι ταὔτ’ ἔλεγον ὅτι ὁ Ἀσσύριος οἴχοιτο ἐπὶ Λυδίας , πολλὰ τάλαντα χρυσίου καὶ ἀργυρίου ἄγων καὶ ἄλλα κτήματα καὶ κόσμον παντοδαπόν .
From Babylon a report was now brought by deserters and confirmed by his prisoners of war, that the Assyrian king had gone off in the direction of Lydia with many talents of gold and silver and with other treasures and jewels of every sort.


6.1.26
3070
ὁ μὲν οὖν ὄχλος τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἔλεγεν ὡς ὑπεκτίθοιτο ἤδη τὰ χρήματα φοβούμενος ·
So it became general talk among the rank and file of the soldiers that he was already conveying his treasures to a place of safety because he was afraid.


6.1.26
3071
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος γιγνώσκων ὅτι οἴχοιτο συστήσων εἴ τι δύναιτο ἀντίπαλον ἑαυτῷ , ἀντιπαρεσκευάζετο ἐρρωμένως , ὡς μάχης ἔτι δεῆσον ·
But Cyrus, recognizing that he had gone for the purpose of forming, if he could, a coalition against him, made vigorous counter preparation in the expectation that he would have to fight again.


6.1.26
3072
ὥστ’ ἐξεπίμπλη μὲν τὸ τῶν Περσῶν ἱππικόν , τοὺς μὲν ἐκ τῶν αἰχμαλώτων , τοὺς δέ τινας καὶ παρὰ τῶν φίλων λαμβάνων ἵππους ·
And so he set about bringing to its full complement the Persian cavalry, for which he obtained horses, some requisitioned from the captives, and a certain number also presented to him by his friends;


6.1.26
3073
ταῦτα γὰρ παρὰ πάντων ἐδέχετο καὶ ἀπεωθεῖτο οὐδέν , οὔτε εἴ τις ὅπλον διδοίη καλὸν οὔτ’ εἴ τις ἵππον ·
for he accepted such gifts from every one and never refused anything, whether any one offered him a fine weapon or a horse.


6.1.27
3074
κατεσκευάζετο δὲ καὶ ἅρματα ἔκ τε τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ἁρμάτων καὶ ἄλλοθεν ὁπόθεν ἐδύνατο .
Besides, with the chariots taken from the enemy and with whatever others he could get he equipped a corps of chariots of his own.


6.1.27
3075
καὶ τὴν μὲν Τρωικὴν διφρείαν πρόσθεν οὖσαν καὶ τὴν Κυρηναίων ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἁρματηλασίαν κατέλυσε ·
The method of managing a chariot employed of old at Troy and that in vogue among the Cyrenaeans even unto this day he abolished;


6.1.27
3076
τὸν γὰρ πρόσθεν χρόνον καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Μηδίᾳ καὶ Συρίᾳ καὶ Ἀραβίᾳ καὶ πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ τοῖς ἅρμασιν οὕτως ἐχρῶντο ὥσπερ νῦν οἱ Κυρηναῖοι .
for in previous times people in Media and in Syria and in Arabia, and all the people in Asia used the chariot just as the Cyrenaeans now do.


6.1.28
3077
ἔδοξε δ’ αὐτῷ , ὃ κράτιστον εἰκὸς ἦν εἶναι τῆς δυνάμεως , ὄντων τῶν βελτίστων ἐπὶ τοῖς ἅρμασι , τοῦτο ἐν ἀκροβολιστῶν μέρει εἶναι καὶ εἰς τὸ κρατεῖν οὐδὲν μέγα βάρος συμβάλλεσθαι .
But it seemed to him that inasmuch as the best men were mounted on the chariots, that part which might have been the chief strength of the army acted only the part of skirmishers and did not contribute anything of importance to the victory.


6.1.28
3078
ἅρματα γὰρ τριακόσια τοὺς μὲν μαχομένους παρέχεται τριακοσίους , ἵπποις δ’ οὗτοι χρῶνται διακοσίοις καὶ χιλίοις ·
For three hundred chariots call for three hundred combatants and require twelve hundred horses.


6.1.28
3079
ἡνίοχοι δ’ αὐτοῖς εἰσὶ μὲν ὡς εἰκὸς οἷς μάλιστα πιστεύουσιν , οἱ βέλτιστοι ·
And the fighting men must of course have as drivers the men in whom they have most confidence, that is, the best men to be had.


6.1.28
3080
ἄλλοι δὲ εἰσὶ τριακόσιοι οὗτοι , οἳ οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν τοὺς πολεμίους βλάπτουσι .
That makes three hundred more, who do not do the enemy the least harm.


6.1.29
3081
ταύτην μὲν οὖν τὴν διφρείαν κατέλυσεν ·
So he abolished this method of handling chariots,


6.1.29
3082
ἀντὶ δὲ τούτου πολεμιστήρια κατεσκευάσατο ἅρματα τροχοῖς τε ἰσχυροῖς , ὡς μὴ ῥᾳδίως συντρίβηται , ἄξοσί τε μακροῖς ·
and in place of it he had chariots of war constructed with strong wheels, so that they might not easily be broken, and with long axles;


6.1.29
3083
ἧττον γὰρ ἀνατρέπεται πάντα τὰ πλατέα ·
for anything broad is less likely to be overturned.


6.1.29
3084
τὸν δὲ δίφρον τοῖς ἡνιόχοις ἐποίησεν ὥσπερ πύργον ἰσχυρῶν ξύλων ·
The box for the driver he constructed out of strong timbers in the form of a turret;


6.1.29
3085
ὕψος δὲ τούτων ἐστὶ μέχρι τῶν ἀγκώνων , ὡς δύνωνται ἡνιοχεῖσθαι οἱ ἵπποι ὑπὲρ τῶν δίφρων ·
and this rose in height to the drivers’ elbows, so that they could manage the horses by reaching over the top of the box;


6.1.29
3086
τοὺς δ’ ἡνιόχους ἐθωράκισε πάντα πλὴν τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν .
and, besides, he covered the drivers with mail, all except their eyes.


6.1.30
3087
προσέθηκε δὲ καὶ δρέπανα σιδηρᾶ ὡς διπήχη πρὸς τοὺς ἄξονας ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν τῶν τροχῶν καὶ ἄλλα κάτω ὑπὸ τῷ ἄξονι εἰς τὴν γῆν βλέποντα , ὡς ἐμβαλούντων εἰς τοὺς ἐναντίους τοῖς ἅρμασιν .
On both sides of the wheels, moreover, he attached to the axles steel scythes about two cubits long and beneath the axles other scythes pointing down toward the ground; this was so arranged with the intention of hurling the chariots into the midst of the enemy.


6.1.30
3088
ὡς δὲ τότε Κῦρος ταῦτα κατεσκεύασεν , οὕτως ἔτι καὶ νῦν τοῖς ἅρμασι χρῶνται οἱ ἐν τῇ βασιλέως χώρᾳ .
And as Cyrus constructed them at that time, such even to this day are the chariots in use in the king’s dominions.


6.1.30
3089
ἦσαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ κάμηλοι πολλαὶ παρά τε τῶν φίλων συνειλεγμέναι καὶ αἱ αἰχμάλωτοι πᾶσαι συνηθροισμέναι .
He also had a large number of camels, some collected from among his friends and some taken in war, all brought together.


6.1.31
3090
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν οὕτω συνεπεραίνετο .
Thus these plans were being put into execution.


6.1.31
3091
βουλόμενος δὲ κατάσκοπόν τινα πέμψαι ἐπὶ Λυδίας καὶ μαθεῖν ὅ τι πράττοι ὁ Ἀσσύριος , ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ ἐπιτήδειος εἶναι Ἀράσπας ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ τοῦτο ὁ φυλάττων τὴν καλὴν γυναῖκα .
Now, he wished to send some one as a spy into Lydia to find out what the Assyrian was doing, and it seemed to him that Araspas, the guardian of the beautiful woman, was the proper person to go on this mission.


6.1.31
3092
συνεβεβήκει γὰρ τῷ Ἀράσπᾳ τοιάδε .
Now Araspas’s case had taken a turn like this:


6.1.31
3093
ληφθεὶς ἔρωτι τῆς γυναικὸς ἠναγκάσθη προσενεγκεῖν λόγους αὐτῇ περὶ συνουσίας .
he had fallen in love with the lady and could not resist the impulse to approach her with amorous proposals.


6.1.32
3094
ἡ δὲ ἀπέφησε μὲν καὶ ἦν πιστὴ τῷ ἀνδρὶ καίπερ ἀπόντι ·
But she repulsed his advances and was true to her husband, although he was far away;


6.1.32
3095
ἐφίλει γὰρ αὐτὸν ἰσχυρῶς ·
for she loved him devotedly.


6.1.32
3096
οὐ μέντοι κατηγόρησε τοῦ Ἀράσπου πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον , ὀκνοῦσα συμβαλεῖν φίλους ἄνδρας .
Still, she did not accuse Araspas to Cyrus, for she shrank from making trouble between friends.


6.1.33
3097
ἐπεὶ δὲ ὁ Ἀράσπας δοκῶν ὑπηρετήσειν τῷ τυχεῖν ἃ ἐβούλετο ἠπείλησε τῇ γυναικὶ ὅτι εἰ μὴ βούλοιτο ἑκοῦσα , ἄκουσα ποιήσοι ταῦτα , ἐκ τούτου ἡ γυνή , ὡς ἔδεισε τὴν βίαν , οὐκέτι κρύπτει , ἀλλὰ πέμπει τὸν εὐνοῦχον πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον καὶ κελεύει λέξαι πάντα .
But when Araspas, thinking that he should thus further the attainment of his desires, threatened the woman that he would use force if she would not submit willingly, then in fear of outrage the lady no longer kept it secret but sent her eunuch to Cyrus  with instructions to tell him the whole story.


6.1.34
3098
ὁ δ’ ὡς ἤκουσεν , ἀναγελάσας ἐπὶ τῷ κρείττονι τοῦ ἔρωτος φάσκοντι εἶναι , πέμπει Ἀρτάβαζον σὺν τῷ εὐνούχῳ καὶ κελεύει αὐτῷ εἰπεῖν βιάζεσθαι μὲν μὴ τοιαύτην γυναῖκα , πείθειν δὲ εἰ δύναιτο , οὐκ ἔφη κωλύειν .
When Cyrus  heard it he laughed outright at the man who had claimed to be superior to the passion of love; and he sent Artabazus back with the eunuch and bade him warn Araspas not to lay violent hands upon such a woman; but if he could win her consent, he himself would interpose no objection.


6.1.35
3099
ἐλθὼν δ’ ὁ Ἀρτάβαζος πρὸς τὸν Ἀράσπαν ἐλοιδόρησεν αὐτόν , παρακαταθήκην ὀνομάζων τὴν γυναῖκα , ἀσέβειάν τε αὐτοῦ λέγων ἀδικίαν τε καὶ ἀκράτειαν , ὥστε τὸν Ἀράσπαν πολλὰ μὲν δακρύειν ὑπὸ λύπης , καταδύεσθαι δ’ ὑπὸ τῆς αἰσχύνης , ἀπολωλέναι δὲ τῷ φόβῳ μή τι καὶ πάθοι ὑπὸ Κύρου .
So, when Artabazus came to Araspas, he rebuked him severely, saying that the woman had been given to him in trust; and he dwelt upon his ungodliness, sinfulness, and sensuality, until Araspas shed bitter tears of contrition and was overwhelmed with shame and frightened to death lest Cyrus  should punish him.


6.1.36
3100
ὁ οὖν Κῦρος καταμαθὼν ταῦτα ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν καὶ μόνος μόνῳ ἔλεξεν ·
So, when Cyrus learned of this he sent for him and had a talk with him in private.


6.1.36
3101
ὁρῶ σε , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀράσπα , φοβούμενόν τε ἐμὲ καὶ ἐν αἰσχύνῃ δεινῶς ἔχοντα .
I see, Araspas, said he, that you are afraid of me and terribly overcome with shame.


6.1.36
3102
παῦσαι οὖν τούτων ·
Do not feel that way, pray;


6.1.36
3103
ἐγὼ γὰρ θεούς τε ἀκούω ἔρωτος ἡττῆσθαι , ἀνθρώπους τε οἶδα καὶ μάλα δοκοῦντας φρονίμους εἶναι οἷα πεπόνθασιν ὑπ’ ἔρωτος ·
for I have heard say that even gods are victims of love; and as for mortals, I know what even some who are considered very discreet have suffered from love.


6.1.36
3104
καὶ αὐτὸς δ’ ἐμαυτοῦ κατέγνων μὴ ἂν καρτερῆσαι ὥστε συνὼν καλοῖς ἀμελεῖν αὐτῶν .
And I had too poor an opinion of myself to suppose that I should have the strength of will to be thrown in contact with beauty and be indifferent to it.


6.1.36
3105
καὶ σοὶ δὲ τούτου τοῦ πράγματος ἐγὼ αἴτιός εἰμι ·
Besides, I am myself responsible for your condition,


6.1.36
3106
ἐγὼ γάρ σε συγκατεῖρξα τούτῳ τῷ ἀμάχῳ πράγματι .
for it was I that shut you up with this irresistible creature.


6.1.37
3107
καὶ ὁ Ἀράσπας ὑπολαβὼν εἶπεν ·
Aye, Cyrus, said Araspas, interrupting him,


6.1.37
3108
ἀλλὰ σὺ μέν , ὦ Κῦρε , καὶ ταῦτα ὅμοιος εἶ οἷόσπερ καὶ τ- ἄλλα , πρᾷός τε καὶ συγγνώμων τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων ἁμαρτημάτων ·
you are in this, just as in everything else, gentle and forgiving of human errors.


6.1.37
3109
ἐμὲ δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ἄνθρωποι καταδύουσι τῷ ἄχει .
Other men make me ready to sink with my shame;


6.1.37
3110
ὡς γὰρ ὁ θροῦς διῆλθε τῆς ἐμῆς συμφορᾶς , οἱ μὲν ἐχθροὶ ἐφήδονταί μοι , οἱ δὲ φίλοι προσιόντες συμβουλεύουσιν ἐκποδὼν ἔχειν ἐμαυτόν , μή τι καὶ πάθω ὑπὸ σοῦ , ὡς ἠδικηκότος ἐμοῦ μεγάλα .
for ever since the report of my fall got out, my enemies have been exulting over me, while my friends come to me and advise me to keep out of the way, for fear that you punish me for committing so great a wrong.


6.1.38
3111
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Let me tell you then, Araspas, said Cyrus,


6.1.38
3112
εὖ τοίνυν ἴσθι , ὦ Ἀράσπα , ὅτι ταύτῃ τῇ δόξῃ οἷός τ’ εἶ ἐμοί τε ἰσχυρῶς χαρίσασθαι καὶ τοὺς συμμάχους μεγάλα ὠφελῆσαι .
that by reason of this very report which people have heard in regard to you, you are in a position to do me a very great favour and to be of great assistance to our allies.


6.1.38
3113
εἰ γὰρ γένοιτο , ἔφη ὁ Ἀράσπας , ὅ τι ἐγώ σοι ἐν καιρῷ ἂν γενοίμην αὖ χρήσιμος .
Would that some occasion might arise, answered Araspas, in which I could be of service to you.


6.1.39
3114
εἰ τοίνυν , ἔφη , προσποιησάμενος ἐμὲ φεύγειν ἐθέλοις εἰς τοὺς πολεμίους ἐλθεῖν , οἴομαι ἄν σε πιστευθῆναι ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων .
If, then, said the other, under pretence that you were fleeing from me you would go over into the enemy’s country, I believe they would trust you.


6.1.39
3115
ἔγωγε ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Ἀράσπας , καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν φίλων οἶδα ὅτι ὡς σὲ πεφευγὼς λόγον ἂν παρέχοιμι .
Aye, by Zeus, said Araspas, and I know that even with my friends I could start the story that I was running away from you.


6.1.40
3116
ἔλθοις ἂν τοίνυν , ἔφη , ἡμῖν πάντα εἰδὼς τὰ τῶν πολεμίων ·
Then you would return to us, said he, with full information about the enemy’s condition and plans.


6.1.40
3117
οἶμαι δὲ καὶ λόγων καὶ βουλευμάτων κοινωνὸν ἄν σε ποιοῖντο διὰ τὸ πιστεύειν , ὥστε μηδὲ ἕν σε λεληθέναι ὧν βουλόμεθα εἰδέναι .
And I suppose that because of their trusting you they would make you a participant in their discussions and counsels, so that not a single thing that we wish to know would be hidden from you.


6.1.40
3118
ὡς πορευσομένου , ἔφη , ἤδη νυνί ·
Depend upon it, said he, I will start at once;


6.1.40
3119
καὶ γὰρ τοῦτο ἴσως ἓν τῶν πιστῶν ἔσται τὸ δοκεῖν με ὑπὸ σοῦ μελλήσαντά τι παθεῖν ἐκπεφευγέναι .
and one of the circumstances that will gain my story credence will be the appearance that I have run away because I was likely to be punished by you.


6.1.41
3120
ἦ καὶ δυνήσῃ ἀπολιπεῖν , ἔφη , τὴν καλὴν Πάνθειαν ;
And will you be able to give up the beautiful Panthea? asked Cyrus.


6.1.41
3121
δύο γάρ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , σαφῶς ἔχω ψυχάς ·
Yes, Cyrus, said he; for I evidently have two souls.


6.1.41
3122
νῦν τοῦτο πεφιλοσόφηκα μετὰ τοῦ ἀδίκου σοφιστοῦ τοῦ Ἔρωτος .
I have now worked out this doctrine of philosophy in the school of that crooked sophist, Eros.


6.1.41
3123
οὐ γὰρ δὴ μία γε οὖσα ἅμα ἀγαθή τέ ἐστι καὶ κακή , οὐδ’ ἅμα καλῶν τε καὶ αἰσχρῶν ἔργων ἐρᾷ καὶ τ- αὐτὰ ἅμα βούλεταί τε καὶ οὐ βούλεται πράττειν , ἀλλὰ δῆλον ὅτι δύο ἐστὸν ψυχά , καὶ ὅταν μὲν ἡ ἀγαθὴ κρατῇ , τὰ καλὰ πράττεται , ὅταν δὲ ἡ πονηρά , τὰ αἰσχρὰ ἐπιχειρεῖται .
For if the soul is one, it is not both good and bad at the same time, neither can it at the same time desire the right and the wrong, nor at the same time both will and not will to do the same things;


6.1.41
3124
νῦν δὲ ὡς σὲ σύμμαχον ἔλαβε , κρατεῖ ἡ ἀγαθὴ καὶ πάνυ πολύ .
but it is obvious that there are two souls, and when the good one prevails, what is right is done; but when the bad one gains the ascendency, what is wrong is attempted. And now, since she has taken you to be her ally, it is the good soul that has gained the mastery, and that completely.


6.1.42
3125
εἰ τοίνυν καὶ σοὶ δοκεῖ πορεύεσθαι , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὧδε χρὴ ποιεῖν , ἵνα κ- ἐκείνοις πιστότερος ᾖς ·
Well then, answered Cyrus, if you also have decided to go, this is what you must do so as to gain the more credence with them:


6.1.42
3126
ἐξάγγελλέ τε αὐτοῖς τὰ παρ’ ἡμῶν , οὕτω τε ἐξάγγελλε ὡς ἂν αὐτοῖς τὰ παρὰ σοῦ λεγόμενα ἐμποδὼν μάλιστ’ ἂν εἴη ὧν βούλονται πράττειν .
tell them all about our affairs, but frame your account in such a way that your information will be the greatest possible hindrance to the success of their plans.


6.1.42
3127
εἴη δ’ ἂν ἐμποδών , εἰ ἡμᾶς φαίης παρασκευάζεσθαι ἐμβαλεῖν ποι τῆς ἐκείνων χώρας ·
And it would be a hindrance, if you should represent that we were making ready to invade their country at some point;


6.1.42
3128
ταῦτα γὰρ ἀκούοντες ἧττον ἂν παντὶ σθένει ἁθροίζοιντο , ἕκαστός τις φοβούμενος καὶ περὶ τῶν οἴκοι .
for upon hearing this, they would be less likely to gather in full force, as each man would be afraid for his own possessions at home.


6.1.43
3129
καὶ μένε , ἔφη , παρ’ ἐκείνοις ὅτι πλεῖστον χρόνον ·
And stay with them as long as possible;


6.1.43
3130
ἃ γὰρ ἂν ποιῶσιν ὅταν ἐγγύτατα ἡμῶν ὦσι , ταῦτα μάλιστα καιρὸς ἡμῖν εἰδέναι ἔσται .
for the most valuable information we can have will be in regard to what they are doing when they have come nearest to us.


6.1.43
3131
συμβούλευε δ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐκτάττεσθαι ὅπῃ ἂν δοκῇ κράτιστον εἶναι ·
And advise them also to marshal themselves in whatever order seems best;


6.1.43
3132
ὅταν γὰρ σὺ ἀπέλθῃς εἰδέναι δοκῶν τὴν τάξιν αὐτῶν , ἀναγκαῖον οὕτω τετάχθαι αὐτοῖς ·
for when you come away, it will be necessary for them to retain this order, even though they think you are familiar with it.


6.1.43
3133
μετατάττεσθαι γὰρ ὀκνήσουσι , καὶ ἤν πῃ ἄλλῃ μετατάττωνται ἐξ ὑπογύου , ταράξονται .
For they will be slow to change it, and, if on the spur of the moment they make a change anywhere, they will be thrown into confusion.


6.1.44
3134
Ἀράσπας μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἐξελθὼν καὶ συλλαβὼν τοὺς πιστοτάτους θεράποντας καὶ εἰπὼν πρός τινας ἃ ᾤετο συμφέρειν τῷ πράγματι ᾤχετο .
Then Araspas withdrew; he got together the most trusted of his attendants, told some of his friends such things as he thought would contribute to the success of his scheme, and was gone.


6.1.45
3135
ἡ δὲ Πάνθεια ὡς ᾔσθετο οἰχόμενον τὸν Ἀράσπαν , πέμψασα πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον εἶπε ·
When Panthea learned that Araspas had gone away, she sent word to Cyrus, saying:


6.1.45
3136
μὴ λυποῦ , ὦ Κῦρε , ὅτι Ἀράσπας οἴχεται εἰς τοὺς πολεμίους ·
Do not be distressed, Cyrus, that Araspas has gone over to the enemy;


6.1.45
3137
ἢν γὰρ ἐμὲ ἐάσῃς πέμψαι πρὸς τὸν ἐμὸν ἄνδρα , ἐγώ σοι ἀναδέχομαι ἥξειν πολὺ Ἀράσπου πιστότερον φίλον ·
for if you will allow me to send to my husband, I can guarantee you that a much more faithful friend will come to you than Araspas was.


6.1.45
3138
καὶ δύναμιν δὲ οἶδ’ ὅτι ὁπόσην ἂν δύνηται ἔχων παρέσται σοι .
And what is more, I know that he will come to you with as many troops as he can bring.


6.1.45
3139
καὶ γὰρ ὁ μὲν πατὴρ τοῦ νῦν βασιλεύοντος φίλος ἦν αὐτῷ ·
For while the father of the present king was his friend,


6.1.45
3140
ὁ δὲ νῦν βασιλεύων καὶ ἐπεχείρησέ ποτε ἐμὲ καὶ τὸν ἄνδρα διασπάσαι ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων ·
this present king once even attempted to separate me from my husband.


6.1.45
3141
ὑβριστὴν οὖν νομίζων αὐτὸν εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι ἄσμενος ἂν πρὸς ἄνδρα οἷος σὺ εἶ ἀπαλλαγείη .
Inasmuch, therefore, as he considers the king an insolent scoundrel, I am sure that he would be glad to transfer his allegiance to such a man as you.


6.1.46
3142
ἀκούσας ταῦτα ὁ Κῦρος ἐκέλευε πέμπειν πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα ·
When Cyrus heard that, he bade her send word to her husband;


6.1.46
3143
ἡ δ’ ἔπεμψεν .
and she did so.


6.1.46
3144
ὡς δ’ ἔγνω ὁ Ἀβραδάτας τὰ παρὰ τῆς γυναικὸς σύμβολα , καὶ τ- ἄλλα δὲ ᾔσθετο ὡς εἶχεν , ἄσμενος πορεύεται πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον ἵππους ἔχων ἀμφὶ τοὺς χιλίους .
And when Abradatas read the cipher message sent by his wife and was informed how matters stood otherwise, he joyfully proceeded with about a thousand horse to join Cyrus.


6.1.46
3145
ὡς δ’ ἦν πρὸς τοῖς τῶν Περσῶν σκοποῖς , πέμπει πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον εἰπὼν ὃς ἦν .
When he came up to the Persian sentries, he sent to Cyrus to let him know who it was;


6.1.46
3146
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος εὐθὺς ἄγειν κελεύει αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα .
and Cyrus gave orders to take him at once to his wife.


6.1.47
3147
ὡς δ’ εἰδέτην ἀλλήλους ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ὁ Ἀβραδάτας , ἠσπάζοντο ἀλλήλους ὡς εἰκὸς ἐκ δυσελπίστων .
And when Abradatas and his wife saw each other they embraced each other with joy, as was natural, considering they had not expected ever to meet again.


6.1.47
3148
ἐκ τούτου δὴ λέγει ἡ Πάνθεια τοῦ Κύρου τὴν ὁσιότητα καὶ τὴν σωφροσύνην καὶ τὴν πρὸς αὑτὴν κατοίκτισιν .
Thereafter Panthea told of Cyrus’s piety and self-restraint and of his compassion for her.


6.1.47
3149
ὁ δὲ Ἀβραδάτας ἀκούσας εἶπε ·
Tell me, Panthea, said Abradatas when he heard this,


6.1.47
3150
τί ἂν οὖν ἐγὼ ποιῶν , ὦ Πάνθεια , χάριν Κύρῳ ὑπέρ τε σοῦ καὶ ἐμαυτοῦ ἀποδοίην ;
what can I do to pay the debt of gratitude that you and I owe to Cyrus?


6.1.47
3151
τί δὲ ἄλλο , ἔφη ἡ Πάνθεια , ἢ πειρώμενος ὅμοιος εἶναι περὶ ἐκεῖνον οἷόσπερ ἐκεῖνος περὶ σέ ;
What else, pray, said Panthea, than to try to be to him what he has been to you?


6.1.48
3152
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ἔρχεται πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον ὁ Ἀβραδάτας ·
Later Abradatas went to Cyrus.


6.1.48
3153
καὶ ὡς εἶδεν αὐτόν , λαβόμενος τῆς δεξιᾶς εἶπεν ·
When he saw him he took his right hand in his and said:


6.1.48
3154
ἀνθ’ ὧν σὺ εὖ πεποίηκας ἡμᾶς , ὦ Κῦρε , οὐκ ἔχω τί μεῖζον εἴπω ἢ ὅτι φίλον σοι ἐμαυτὸν δίδωμι καὶ θεράποντα καὶ σύμμαχον ·
In return for the kindnesses you have done us, Cyrus, I do not know what more to say than that I offer myself to you to be your friend, your servant, your ally.


6.1.48
3155
καὶ ὅσα ἂν ὁρῶ σε σπουδάζοντα , συνεργὸς πειράσομαι γίγνεσθαι ὡς ἂν δύνωμαι κράτιστος .
And in whatsoever enterprise I see you engage, I shall try to co-operate with you to the very best of my ability.


6.1.49
3156
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Cyrus said:


6.1.49
3157
ἐγὼ δὲ δέχομαι ·
And I accept your offer.


6.1.49
3158
καὶ νῦν μέν σε ἀφίημι , ἔφη , σὺν τῇ γυναικὶ δειπνεῖν ·
And now I will take leave of you and let you go to dinner with your wife.


6.1.49
3159
αὖθις δὲ καὶ παρ’ ἐμοὶ δεήσει σε σκηνοῦν σὺν τοῖς σοῖς τε καὶ ἐμοῖς φίλοις .
Some other time you will be expected to dine at my headquarters with your friends and mine.


6.1.50
3160
ἐκ τούτου ὁρῶν ὁ Ἀβραδάτας σπουδάζοντα τὸν Κῦρον περὶ τὰ δρεπανηφόρα ἅρματα καὶ περὶ τοὺς τεθωρακισμένους ἵππους τε καὶ ἱππέας , ἐπειρᾶτο συντελεῖν αὐτῷ εἰς τὰ ἑκατὸν ἅρματα ἐκ τοῦ ἱππικοῦ τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ ὅμοια ἐκείνῳ ·
After this, as Abradatas observed that Cyrus was busily engaged with the scythe-bearing chariots and the mailed horses and riders, he tried to contribute from his own cavalry as many as a hundred chariots like them;


6.1.50
3161
αὐτὸς δὲ ὡς ἡγησόμενος αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἅρματος παρεσκευάζετο .
and he made ready to lead them in person upon his chariot.


6.1.51
3162
συνεζεύξατο δὲ τὸ ἑαυτοῦ ἅρμα τετράρρυμόν τε καὶ ἵππων ὀκτώ ·
He had the harnessing of his own chariot, moreover, arranged with four poles and eight horses abreast;


6.1.51
3163
ἡ δὲ Πάνθεια ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν ἑαυτῆς χρημάτων χρυσοῦν τε αὐτῷ θώρακα ἐποιήσατο καὶ χρυσοῦν κράνος , ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ περιβραχιόνια .
and his wife, Panthea, with her own money had a golden corselet made for him and a helmet and armlet of gold;


6.1.51
3164
τοὺς δὲ ἵππους τοῦ ἅρματος χαλκοῖς πᾶσι προβλήμασι κατεσκευάσατο .
and he had the horses of his chariot equipped with armour of solid bronze.


6.1.52
3165
Ἀβραδάτας μὲν ταῦτα ἔπραττε ·
Such was the work of Abradatas;


6.1.52
3166
Κῦρος δὲ ἰδὼν τὸ τετράρρυμον αὐτοῦ ἅρμα κατενόησεν ὅτι οἷόν τε εἴη καὶ ὀκτάρρυμον ποιήσασθαι , ὥστε ὀκτὼ ζεύγεσι βοῶν ἄγειν τῶν μηχανῶν τὸ κατώτατον οἴκημα ·
and when Cyrus saw his chariot with four poles, he conceived the idea that it was possible to make one even with eight poles, so as to move with eight yoke of oxen the lowest story of his movable towers;


6.1.52
3167
ἦν δὲ τοῦτο τριώρυγον μάλιστα ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς σὺν τοῖς τροχοῖς .
including the wheels, this portion was about three fathoms high from the ground.


6.1.53
3168
τοιοῦτοι δὲ πύργοι σὺν τάξει ἀκολουθοῦντες ἐδόκουν αὐτῷ μεγάλη μὲν ἐπικουρία γενήσεσθαι τῇ ἑαυτῶν φάλαγγι , μεγάλη δὲ βλάβη τῇ τῶν πολεμίων τάξει .
Moreover, when such towers were taken along with each division of the army, it seemed to him that they were a great help to his own phalanx and would occasion great loss to the ranks of the enemy.


6.1.53
3169
ἐποίησε δὲ ἐπὶ τῶν οἰκημάτων καὶ περιδρόμους καὶ ἐπάλξεις ·
And on the different stories he constructed galleries also and battlements;


6.1.53
3170
ἀνεβίβαζε δ’ ἐπὶ τὸν πύργον ἕκαστον ἄνδρας εἴκοσιν .
and on each tower he stationed twenty men.


6.1.54
3171
ἐπεὶ δὲ πάντα συνειστήκει αὐτῷ τὰ περὶ τοὺς πύργους , ἐλάμβανε τοῦ ἀγωγίου πεῖραν ·
Now when all the appurtenances of his towers were put together, he made an experiment of their draught;


6.1.54
3172
καὶ πολὺ ῥᾷον ἦγε τὰ ὀκτὼ ζεύγη τὸν πύργον καὶ τοὺς ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἄνδρας ἢ τὸ σκευοφορικὸν βάρος ἕκαστον τὸ ζεῦγος .
and the eight yoke of oxen drew the tower with the men upon it more easily than each individual yoke could draw its usual load of baggage;


6.1.54
3173
σκευῶν μὲν γὰρ βάρος ἀμφὶ τὰ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι τάλαντα ἦν ζεύγει ·
for the load of baggage was about twenty-five talents to the yoke;


6.1.54
3174
τοῦ δὲ πύργου , ὥσπερ τραγικῆς σκηνῆς τῶν ξύλων πάχος ἐχόντων , καὶ εἴκοσιν ἀνδρῶν καὶ ὅπλων , τούτων ἐγένετο ἔλαττον ἢ πεντεκαίδεκα τάλαντα ἑκάστῳ ζεύγει τὸ ἀγώγιον .
whereas the weight of the tower, on which the timbers were as thick as those of the tragic stage, together with the twenty men and their arms amounted to less than fifteen talents to each yoke of oxen.


6.1.55
3175
ὡς δ’ ἔγνω εὔπορον οὖσαν τὴν ἀγωγήν , παρεσκευάζετο ὡς ἄξων τοὺς πύργους σὺν τῷ στρατεύματι , νομίζων τὴν ἐν πολέμῳ πλεονεξίαν ἅμα σωτηρίαν τε καὶ δικαιοσύνην εἶναι καὶ εὐδαιμονίαν .
Inasmuch, therefore, as he found that the hauling of the towers was easy, he made ready to take them with the army, for he thought that seizing an advantage in time of war was at once safety and justice and happiness.


6.2.1
3176
ἦλθον δ’ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ χρόνῳ καὶ παρὰ τοῦ Ἰνδοῦ χρήματα ἄγοντες καὶ ἀπήγγελλον αὐτῷ ὅτι ὁ Ἰνδὸς ἐπιστέλλει τοιάδε .
At this juncture, representatives from the Indian king arrived with money; they announced also that the Indian king sent him the following message:


6.2.1
3177
ἐγώ , ὦ Κῦρε , ἥδομαι ὅτι μοι ἐπήγγειλας ὧν ἐδέου , καὶ βούλομαί σοι ξένος εἶναι καὶ πέμπω σοι χρήματα ·
I am glad, Cyrus, that you let me know what you needed. I desire to be your friend, and I am sending you the money,


6.2.1
3178
κἂν ἄλλων δέῃ , μεταπέμπου .
and if you need more, send for it.


6.2.1
3179
ἐπέσταλται δὲ τοῖς παρ’ ἐμοῦ ποιεῖν ὅ τι ἂν σὺ κελεύῃς .
Moreover, my representatives have been instructed to do whatever you ask.


6.2.2
3180
ἀκούσας δὲ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε ·
Well then, said Cyrus, when he heard this,


6.2.2
3181
κελεύω τοίνυν ὑμᾶς τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους μένοντας ἔνθα κατεσκηνώκατε φυλάττειν τὰ χρήματα καὶ ζῆν ὅπως ὑμῖν ἥδιστον ·
I ask some of you to remain where you have been assigned quarters and keep guard of this money and live as best pleases you,


6.2.2
3182
τρεῖς δέ μοι ἐλθόντες ὑμῶν ἐς τοὺς πολεμίους ὡς παρὰ τοῦ Ἰνδοῦ περὶ συμμαχίας , καὶ τὰ ἐκεῖ μαθόντες ὅ τι ἂν λέγωσί τε καὶ ποιῶσιν , ὡς τάχιστα ἀπαγγείλατε ἐμοί τε καὶ τῷ Ἰνδῷ ·
while three of you will please go to the enemy on pretence of having been sent by the king of India to make an alliance between them and him; and when you have learned how things stand there, what they are doing and proposing to do, bring word of it as soon as possible to me and to your king.


6.2.2
3183
κἂν ταῦτά μοι καλῶς ὑπηρετήσητε , ἔτι μᾶλλον ὑμῖν χάριν εἴσομαι τούτου ἢ ὅτι χρήματα πάρεστε ἄγοντες .
And if you perform this service acceptably, I shall be even more grateful to you for that than I am for your bringing the money with which you have come.


6.2.2
3184
καὶ γὰρ οἱ μὲν δούλοις ἐοικότες κατάσκοποι οὐδὲν ἄλλο δύνανται εἰδότες ἀπαγγέλλειν ἢ ὅσα πάντες ἴσασιν ·
And this is service which you are eminently fitted to perform; for spies disguised as slaves can give information of nothing more in their reports than what everyone knows;


6.2.2
3185
οἱ δὲ οἷοίπερ ὑμεῖς ἄνδρες πολλάκις καὶ τὰ βουλευόμενα καταμανθάνουσιν .
whereas men in your capacity often discover even what is being planned.


6.2.3
3186
οἱ μὲν δὴ Ἰνδοὶ ἡδέως ἀκούσαντες καὶ ξενισθέντες τότε παρὰ Κύρῳ , συσκευασάμενοι τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ἐπορεύοντο , ὑποσχόμενοι ἦ μὴν μαθόντες ὅσα ἂν δύνωνται πλεῖστα ἐκ τῶν πολεμίων ἥξειν ὡς δυνατὸν τάχιστα .
The Indians were naturally pleased to hear this, and when they had been entertained by Cyrus , they made ready and set out on the following day with the solemn promise that when they had learned as much as they could they would return from the enemy’s side with all possible dispatch.


6.2.4
3187
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τά τε ἄλλα εἰς τὸν πόλεμον παρεσκευάζετο μεγαλοπρεπῶς , ὡς δὴ ἀνὴρ οὐδὲν μικρὸν ἐπινοῶν πράττειν , ἐπεμελεῖτο δὲ οὐ μόνον ὧν ἔδοξε τοῖς συμμάχοις , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἔριν ἐνέβαλλε πρὸς ἀλλήλους τοῖς φίλοις ὅπως αὐτοὶ ἕκαστοι φανοῦνται καὶ εὐοπλότατοι καὶ ἱππικώτατοι καὶ ἀκοντιστικώτατοι καὶ τοξικώτατοι καὶ φιλοπονώτατοι .
The rest of his preparations for war Cyrus  now continued on a magnificent scale, for he was planning no mean enterprise; and he provided not only for that which his allies had agreed upon but he also inspired his friends to rivalry among themselves, in order that each complement might strive to show its men the best armed soldiers, the most skilled horsemen, the best marksmen with spear or bow, and the most industrious workers.


6.2.5
3188
ταῦτα δὲ ἐξειργάζετο ἐπὶ τὰς θήρας ἐξάγων καὶ τιμῶν τοὺς κρατίστους ἕκαστα ·
And, as a means of accomplishing this, he took them out to hunt and rewarded those who were in each particular most efficient.


6.2.5
3189
καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας δὲ οὓς ἑώρα ἐπιμελομένους τούτου ὅπως οἱ αὑτῶν κράτιστοι ἔσονται στρατιῶται , καὶ τούτους ἐπαινῶν τε παρώξυνε καὶ χαριζόμενος αὐτοῖς ὅ τι δύναιτο .
Furthermore, those officers who, he saw, were eager to have their own soldiers most efficient he spurred on with praise and with whatever favours he could bestow.


6.2.6
3190
εἰ δέ ποτε θυσίαν ποιοῖτο καὶ ἑορτὴν ἄγοι , καὶ ἐν ταύτῃ ὅσα πολέμου ἕνεκα μελετῶσιν ἄνθρωποι πάντων τούτων ἀγῶνας ἐποίει καὶ ἆθλα τοῖς νικῶσι μεγαλοπρεπῶς ἐδίδου , καὶ ἦν πολλὴ εὐθυμία ἐν τῷ στρατεύματι .
And then, too, whenever he performed a sacrifice or celebrated a festival, he instituted in connection with it contests in all those events in which people train as a discipline for war, and to the victors he offered splendid prizes; and the whole camp was in the best of spirits.


6.2.7
3191
τῷ δὲ Κύρῳ σχεδόν τι ἤδη ἀποτετελεσμένα ἦν ὅσα ἐβούλετο ἔχων στρατεύεσθαι πλὴν τῶν μηχανῶν .
Cyrus now had almost everything ready that he wished to have for his expedition except the engines of war.


6.2.7
3192
καὶ γὰρ οἱ Πέρσαι ἱππεῖς ἔκπλεῳ ἤδη ἦσαν εἰς τοὺς μυρίους , καὶ τὰ ἅρματα τὰ δρεπανηφόρα , ἅ τε αὐτὸς κατεσκεύαζεν , ἔκπλεω ἤδη ἦν εἰς τὰ ἑκατόν , ἅ τε Ἀβραδάτας ὁ Σούσιος ἐπεχείρησε κατασκευάζειν ὅμοια τοῖς Κύρου , καὶ ταῦτα ἔκπλεω ἦν εἰς ἄλλα ἑκατόν .
For the ranks of his Persian horse were now filled up to the number of ten thousand, the scythe-bearing chariots that he himself had had constructed had now reached the full number of one hundred, and those which Abradatas of Susa had undertaken to secure like those of Cyrus had also reached the full number of one hundred more.


6.2.8
3193
καὶ τὰ Μηδικὰ δὲ ἅρματα ἐπεπείκει Κῦρος Κυαξάρην εἰς τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον τοῦτον μετασκευάσαι ἐκ τῆς Τρωικῆς καὶ Λιβυκῆς διφρείας ·
And Cyrus had persuaded Cyaxares to transform the Median chariots also from the Trojan and Libyan type to this same style,


6.2.8
3194
καὶ ἔκπλεω καὶ ταῦτα ἦν εἰς ἄλλα ἑκατόν .
and these amounted to another full hundred.


6.2.8
3195
καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς καμήλους δὲ τεταγμένοι ἦσαν ἄνδρες δύο ἐφ’ ἑκάστην τοξόται .
For the camel corps, bowmen were detailed, two upon each camel.


6.2.8
3196
καὶ ὁ μὲν πλεῖστος στρατὸς οὕτως εἶχε τὴν γνώμην ὡς ἤδη παντελῶς κεκρατηκὼς καὶ οὐδὲν ὄντα τὰ τῶν πολεμίων .
Thus the rank and file of the army generally cherished the feeling that the victory was already perfectly assured and that the enemy’s side was as nothing.


6.2.9
3197
ἐπεὶ δὲ οὕτω διακειμένων ἦλθον οἱ Ἰνδοὶ ἐκ τῶν πολεμίων οὓς ἐπεπόμφει Κῦρος ἐπὶ κατασκοπήν , καὶ ἔλεγον ὅτι Κροῖσος μὲν ἡγεμὼν καὶ στρατηγὸς πάντων ᾑρημένος εἴη τῶν πολεμίων , δεδογμένον δ’ εἴη πᾶσι τοῖς συμμάχοις βασιλεῦσι πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει ἕκαστον παρεῖναι , χρήματα δὲ εἰσφέρειν πάμπολλα , ταῦτα δὲ τελεῖν καὶ μισθουμένους οὓς δύναιντο καὶ δωρουμένους οἷς δέοι , ἤδη δὲ καὶ μεμισθωμένους εἶναι πολλοὺς μὲν Θρᾳκῶν μαχαιροφόρους , Αἰγυπτίους δὲ προσπλεῖν , καὶ ἀριθμὸν ἔλεγον εἰς δώδεκα μυριάδας σὺν ἀσπίσι ποδήρεσι καὶ δόρασι μεγάλοις , οἷάπερ καὶ νῦν ἔχουσι , καὶ κοπίσι ·
While they were in this state of mind, the Indians that Cyrus  had sent as spies to the enemy’s camp returned with the report that Croesus had been chosen field-marshal and commander-in-chief of all the enemy’s hosts, that all the allied kings had decided to join him with their entire forces, to contribute vast sums of money, and to expend them in hiring what soldiers they could and in giving presents to those whom they were under obligations to reward.


6.2.10
3198
προσέτι δὲ καὶ Κυπρίων στράτευμα ·
They reported also that many Thracian swordsmen had already been hired and that Egyptians were under sail to join them,


6.2.10
3199
παρεῖναι δ’ ἤδη Κίλικας πάντας καὶ Φρύγας ἀμφοτέρους καὶ Λυκάονας καὶ Παφλαγόνας καὶ Καππαδόκας καὶ Ἀραβίους καὶ Φοίνικας καὶ σὺν τῷ Βαβυλῶνος ἄρχοντι τοὺς Ἀσσυρίους , καὶ Ἴωνας δὲ καὶ Αἰολέας καὶ σχεδὸν πάντας τοὺς Ἕλληνας τοὺς ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ ἐποικοῦντας σὺν Κροίσῳ ἠναγκάσθαι ἕπεσθαι , πεπομφέναι δὲ Κροῖσον καὶ εἰς Λακεδαίμονα περὶ συμμαχίας ·
and they gave the number as one hundred and twenty thousand men armed with shields that came to their feet, with huge spears, such as they carry even to this day, and with sabres. Besides these, there was also the Cyprian army. The Cilicians were all present already, they said, as were also the contingents from both Phrygias, Lycaonia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Arabia, and Phoenicia; the Assyrians were there under the king of Babylon; the Ionians also and the Aeolians and almost all the Greek colonists in Asia had been compelled to join Croesus, and Croesus had even sent to Lacedaemon to negotiate an alliance.


6.2.11
3200
συλλέγεσθαι δὲ τὸ στράτευμα ἀμφὶ τὸν Πακτωλὸν ποταμόν , προϊέναι δὲ μέλλειν αὐτοὺς εἰς Θύμβραρα , ἔνθα καὶ νῦν ὁ σύλλογος τῶν ὑπὸ βασιλέα βαρβάρων τῶν κάτω Συρίας , καὶ ἀγορὰν πᾶσι παρηγγέλθαι ἐνταῦθα κομίζειν ·
This army, they said, was being mustered at the River Pactolus, but it was their intention to advance to Thymbrara,


6.2.11
3201
σχεδὸν δὲ τούτοις τ- αὐτὰ ἔλεγον καὶ οἱ αἰχμάλωτοι ·
where even to-day is the rendezvous of the king’s barbarians from the interior. And a general call had been issued to bring provisions to market there.


6.2.11
3202
ἐπεμελεῖτο γὰρ καὶ τούτου ὁ Κῦρος ὅπως ἁλίσκοιντο παρ’ ὧν ἔμελλε πεύσεσθαί τι ·
The prisoners also told practically the same story as the Indian spies;


6.2.11
3203
ἔπεμπε δὲ καὶ δούλοις ἐοικότας κατασκόπους ὡς αὐτομόλους ·
for this was another thing that Cyrus always looked out for — that prisoners should be taken, from whom he was likely to gain some intelligence. And he used also to send out spies disguised as slaves to pretend that they were deserters from him.


6.2.12
3204
ὡς οὖν ταῦτα ἤκουσεν ὁ στρατὸς τοῦ Κύρου , ἐν φροντίδι τε ἐγένετο , ὥσπερ εἰκός , ἡσυχαίτεροί τε ἢ ὡς εἰώθεσαν διεφοίτων , φαιδροί τε οὐ πάνυ ἐφαίνοντο , ἐκυκλοῦντό τε καὶ μεστὰ ἦν πάντα ἀλλήλους ἐρωτώντων περὶ τούτων καὶ διαλεγομένων .
When Cyrus’s army heard this report, they were disturbed, as was natural; they went about more subdued than had been their wont, they gathered in groups, and every corner was full of people discussing the situation and asking one another’s opinion.


6.2.13
3205
ὡς δὲ ᾔσθετο ὁ Κῦρος φόβον διαθέοντα ἐν τῇ στρατιᾷ , συγκαλεῖ τούς τε ἄρχοντας τῶν στρατευμάτων καὶ πάντας ὁπόσων ἀθυμούντων ἐδόκει βλάβη τις γίγνεσθαι καὶ προθυμουμένων ὠφέλεια .
When Cyrus perceived that a panic was spreading through his army, he called together the officers of the different divisions and all others whose despondency he thought might cause injury and whose enthusiasm would be a help.


6.2.13
3206
προεῖπε δὲ τοῖς ὑπηρέταις , καὶ ἄλλος εἴ τις βούλοιτο τῶν ὁπλοφόρων προσίστασθαι ἀκουσόμενος τῶν λόγων , μὴ κωλύειν .
And he sent word to his aides-de-camp that if any one else of the armed soldiers wished to attend the meeting and listen to the speeches, they should not hinder him.


6.2.13
3207
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνῆλθον , ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
And when they had come together, he addressed them as follows:


6.2.14
3208
ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , ἐγὼ τοίνυν ὑμᾶς συνεκάλεσα ἰδών τινας ὑμῶν , ἐπεὶ αἱ ἀγγελίαι ἦλθον ἐκ τῶν πολεμίων , πάνυ ἐοικότας πεφοβημένοις ἀνθρώποις .
Friends and allies, I have called you together because I observed that when this news came from the enemy, some of you looked as if you were frightened.


6.2.14
3209
δοκεῖ γάρ μοι θαυμαστὸν εἶναι εἴ τις ὑμῶν ὅτι μὲν οἱ πολέμιοι συλλέγονται δέδοικεν , ὅτι δὲ ἡμεῖς πολὺ πλείους συνειλέγμεθα νῦν ἢ ὅτε ἐνικῶμεν ἐκείνους , πολὺ δὲ ἄμεινον σὺν θεοῖς παρεσκευάσμεθα νῦν ἢ πρόσθεν , ταῦτα δὲ ὁρῶντες οὐ θαρρεῖτε .
Now it seems strange to me that any of you should really be afraid because the enemy are mustering; but when you see that we are mustered in much larger numbers than we had when we defeated them and that we are now, thank heaven, much better equipped than we were then — it is strange that when you see this you are not filled with courage!


6.2.15
3210
ὢ πρὸς θεῶν , ἔφη , τί δῆτα ἂν ἐποιήσατε οἱ νῦν δεδοικότες , εἰ ἤγγελλόν τινες τὰ παρ’ ἡμῖν νῦν ὄντα ταῦτα ἀντίπαλα ἡμῖν προσιόντα , καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ἠκούετε , ἔφη , ὅτι οἱ πρότερον νικήσαντες ἡμᾶς οὗτοι πάλιν ἔρχονται ἔχοντες ἐν ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἣν τότε νίκην ἐκτήσαντο ·
What in the name of heaven, pray, would you who are now afraid have done, if the situation were reversed and some one told you that these forces that we have now were coming against us?


6.2.15
3211
ἔπειτα δὲ οἱ τότε ἐκκόψαντες τῶν τοξοτῶν καὶ ἀκοντιστῶν τὰς ἀκροβολίσεις νῦν οὗτοι ἔρχονται καὶ ἄλλοι ὅμοιοι τούτοις πολλαπλάσιοι ·
And what, if you heard, in the first place, that those who had defeated us before were coming again, their hearts full of the victory they then gained; and, in the second place, that those who before made short work of the skirmishing lines of bowmen and spearmen were now coming and others like them many times their number;


6.2.16
3212
ἔπειτα δὲ ὥσπερ οὗτοι ὁπλισάμενοι τοὺς πεζοὺς τότ’ ἐνίκων , νῦν οὕτω καὶ οἱ ἱππεῖς αὐτῶν παρεσκευασμένοι πρὸς τοὺς ἱππέας προσέρχονται , καὶ τὰ μὲν τόξα καὶ ἀκόντια ἀποδεδοκιμάκασι , παλτὸν δὲ ἓν ἰσχυρὸν ἕκαστος λαβὼν προσελαύνειν διανενόηται ὡς ἐκ χειρὸς τὴν μάχην ποιησόμενος ·
and, in the third place, that, equipped in the same armour in which they were armed when their infantry defeated our infantry, they have cavalry now coming to meet our cavalry; that they have rejected the bow and the javelin, and that each man has adopted one heavy lance and is resolved to ride up and fight hand to hand?


6.2.17
3213
ἔτι δὲ ἅρματα ἔρχεται , ἃ οὐχ οὕτως ἑστήξει ὥσπερ πρόσθεν ἀπεστραμμένα ὥσπερ εἰς φυγήν , ἀλλ’ οἵ τε ἵπποι εἰσὶ κατατεθωρακισμένοι οἱ ἐν τοῖς ἅρμασιν , οἵ τε ἡνίοχοι ἐν πύργοις ἑστᾶσι ξυλίνοις τὰ ὑπερέχοντα ἅπαντα συνεστεγασμένοι θώραξι καὶ κράνεσι , δρέπανά τε σιδηρᾶ περὶ τοῖς ἄξοσι προσήρμοσται , ὡς ἐλῶντες καὶ οὗτοι εὐθὺς εἰς τὰς τάξεις τῶν ἐναντίων ·
And again, what would you have done, if you heard that chariots are coming which are not, as before, to stand still facing back as if for flight, but that the horses harnessed to the chariots are covered with mail, while the drivers stand in wooden towers and the parts of their body not defended by the towers are completely panoplied in breast-plates and helmets; and that scythes of steel have been fitted to the axles, and that it is the intention to drive these also into the ranks of the enemy?


6.2.18
3214
πρὸς δ’ ἔτι κάμηλοι εἰσὶν αὐτοῖς ἐφ’ ὧν προσελῶσιν , ὧν μίαν ἑκάστην ἑκατὸν ἵπποι οὐκ ἂν ἀνάσχοιντο ἰδόντες ·
Or again, if you heard that they have camels on which they will ride up to us, and a hundred horses could not endure the sight of any one of them?


6.2.18
3215
ἔτι δὲ πύργους προσίασιν ἔχοντες ἀφ’ ὧν τοῖς μὲν ἑαυτῶν ἀρήξουσιν , ἡμᾶς δὲ βάλλοντες κωλύσουσι τοῖς ἐν τῷ ἰσοπέδῳ μάχεσθαι ·
And again, that they are coming with towers, from which they will protect their comrades and by throwing missiles hinder us from fighting in a fair field?


6.2.19
3216
εἰ δὴ ταῦτα ἀπήγγελλέ τις ὑμῖν ἐν τοῖς πολεμίοις ὄντα , οἱ νῦν φοβούμενοι τί ἂν ἐποιήσατε ;
If any one reported to you that this was the condition of things among the enemy, what would you, who are now so frightened, have done,


6.2.19
3217
ὁπότε ἀπαγγελλομένων ὑμῖν ὅτι Κροῖσος μὲν ᾕρηται τῶν πολεμίων στρατηγός , ὃς τοσούτῳ Σύρων κακίων ἐγένετο ὅσῳ Σύροι μὲν μάχῃ ἡττηθέντες ἔφυγον , Κροῖσος δὲ ἰδὼν ἡττημένους ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀρήγειν τοῖς συμμάχοις φεύγων ᾤχετο ·
seeing that you were terrified when the report came that Croesus had been elected commander-in-chief of the enemy — Croesus, who was a worse coward than the Syrians; for the Syrians fled because they were defeated in the battle, whereas Croesus, instead of standing by his allies, beat a hasty retreat when he saw that they were defeated?


6.2.20
3218
ἔπειτα δὲ διαγγέλλεται δήπου ὅτι αὐτοὶ μὲν οἱ πολέμιοι οὐχ ἱκανοὶ ἡγοῦνται ὑμῖν εἶναι μάχεσθαι , ἄλλους δὲ μισθοῦνται , ὡς ἄμεινον μαχουμένους ὑπὲρ σφῶν ἢ αὐτοί .
And finally, you see, the report is brought that the enemy do not feel that they are strong enough to fight us by themselves, but are hiring others in the hope that these will fight for them more valiantly than they can for themselves.


6.2.20
3219
εἰ μέντοι τισὶ ταῦτα μὲν τοιαῦτα ὄντα δεινὰ δοκεῖ εἶναι , τὰ δὲ ἡμέτερα φαῦλα , τούτους ἐγώ φημι χρῆναι , ὦ ἄνδρες , ἀφεῖναι εἰς τοὺς ἐναντίους ·
However, if there are any to whom the situation over there — such as it is — seems formidable, while our own condition seems contemptible, I say, men, that we ought to send them over to the enemy,


6.2.20
3220
πολὺ γὰρ ἐκεῖ ὄντες πλείω ἂν ἡμᾶς ἢ παρόντες ὠφελοῖεν .
for they would be much more useful to us over there than in our ranks.


6.2.21
3221
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα εἶπεν ὁ Κῦρος , ἀνέστη Χρυσάντας ὁ Πέρσης καὶ ἔλεξεν ὧδε .
When Cyrus had finished his speech, Chrysantas, the Persian, arose and spoke as follows:


6.2.21
3222
ὦ Κῦρε , μὴ θαύμαζε εἴ τινες ἐσκυθρώπασαν ἀκούσαντες τῶν ἀγγελλομένων ·
Do not wonder, Cyrus, that some looked disconsolate when they heard the report;


6.2.21
3223
οὐ γὰρ φοβηθέντες οὕτω διετέθησαν , ἀλλ’ ἀχθεσθέντες ·
for it was not from fear that they felt this, but from vexation —


6.2.21
3224
ὥσπερ γε , ἔφη , εἴ τινων βουλομένων τε καὶ οἰομένων ἤδη ἀριστήσειν ἐξαγγελθείη τι ἔργον ὃ ἀνάγκη εἴη πρὸ τοῦ ἀρίστου ἐξεργάσασθαι , οὐδεὶς ἂν οἶμαι ἡσθείη ἀκούσας ·
just as, if it should be announced, when people are ready and waiting to sit down to luncheon, that there is some work that they must do before they may eat, not one, I venture to say, would be pleased to hear it.


6.2.21
3225
οὕτω τοίνυν καὶ ἡμεῖς ἤδη οἰόμενοι πλουτήσειν , ἐπεὶ ἠκούσαμεν ὅτι ἐστὶ περίλοιπον ἔργον ὃ δεῖ ἐξεργάσασθαι , συνεσκυθρωπάσαμεν , οὐ φοβούμενοι , ἀλλὰ πεποιῆσθαι ἂν ἤδη καὶ τοῦτο βουλόμενοι .
So we also, thinking we were just on the point of getting rich, all put on a disconsolate look when we heard that there was some work left over which we must do; and it was not because we were frightened, but because we wished that this, too, were already accomplished.


6.2.22
3226
ἀλλὰ γὰρ ἐπειδὴ οὐ περὶ Συρίας μόνον ἀγωνιούμεθα , ὅπου σῖτος πολὺς καὶ πρόβατά ἐστι καὶ φοίνικες οἱ καρποφόροι , ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ Λυδίας , ἔνθα πολὺς μὲν οἶνος , πολλὰ δὲ σῦκα , πολὺ δὲ ἔλαιον , θάλαττα δὲ προσκλύζει καθ’ ἣν πλείω ἔρχεται ἢ ὅσα τις ἑώρακεν ἀγαθά , ταῦτα , ἔφη , ἐννοούμενοι οὐκέτι ἀχθόμεθα , ἀλλὰ θαρροῦμεν ὡς μάλιστα , ἵνα θᾶττον καὶ τούτων τῶν Λυδίων ἀγαθῶν ἀπολαύωμεν .
But our disappointment is past, seeing that we are to contend not for Syria only, where there is an abundance of grain and flocks and date-palms, but for Lydia as well; for in that land there is an abundance of wine and figs and olive oil, and its shores are washed by the sea; and over its waters more good things are brought than any one has ever seen — when we think of that, said he, we are no longer vexed, but our courage rises to the highest point, with desire to come all the more quickly into the enjoyment of these good things in Lydia also.


6.2.22
3227
ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπεν ·
Thus he spoke;


6.2.22
3228
οἱ δὲ σύμμαχοι πάντες ἥσθησάν τε τῷ λόγῳ καὶ ἐπῄνεσαν .
and the allies were all pleased with his speech and applauded.


6.2.23
3229
καὶ μὲν δή , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὦ ἄνδρες , δοκεῖ μοι ἰέναι ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ὡς τάχιστα , ἵνα πρῶτον μὲν αὐτοὺς φθάσωμεν ἀφικόμενοι , ἢν δυνώμεθα , ὅπου τὰ ἐπιτήδεια αὐτοῖς συλλέγεται ·
And indeed, my friends, said Cyrus, I propose that we move against them as soon as possible, in the first place that we may reach the place where their supplies are being collected, before they do, if we can;


6.2.23
3230
ἔπειτα δὲ ὅσῳ ἂν θᾶττον ἴωμεν , τοσούτῳ μείω μὲν τὰ παρόντα αὐτοῖς εὑρήσομεν , πλείω δὲ τὰ ἀπόντα .
and in the second place, because the faster we march the less perfected we shall find their arrangements and the greater we shall find their deficiencies.


6.2.24
3231
ἐγὼ μὲν δὴ οὕτω λέγω ·
This, then, is my proposal;


6.2.24
3232
εἰ δέ τις ἄλλῃ πῃ γιγνώσκει ἢ ἀσφαλέστερον εἶναι ἢ ῥᾷον ἡμῖν , διδασκέτω .
but if any one thinks that any other course would be safer or easier for us, let him inform us.


6.2.24
3233
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνηγόρευον μὲν πολλοὶ ὡς χρεὼν εἴη ὅτι τάχιστα πορεύεσθαι ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους , ἀντέλεγε δὲ οὐδείς , ἐκ τούτου δὴ ὁ Κῦρος ἤρχετο λόγου τοιοῦδε .
Many supported him, saying that it was expedient to proceed as soon as possible against the enemy, and no one opposed his plan; so Cyrus began to speak as follows:


6.2.25
3234
ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , αἱ μὲν ψυχαὶ καὶ τὰ σώματα καὶ τὰ ὅπλα οἷς δεήσει χρῆσθαι ἐκ πολλοῦ ἡμῖν σὺν θεῷ παρεσκεύασται ·
Friends and allies, our souls and bodies and the arms that we shall have to use have, with God’s help, long since been made ready.


6.2.25
3235
νῦν δὲ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια δεῖ εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν συσκευάζεσθαι αὐτοῖς τε ἡμῖν καὶ ὁπόσοις τετράποσι χρώμεθα μὴ μεῖον ἢ εἴκοσιν ἡμερῶν .
And now for the march we must get together for ourselves and for the animals that we use provisions for not less than twenty days;


6.2.25
3236
ἐγὼ γὰρ λογιζόμενος εὑρίσκω πλέον ἢ πεντεκαίδεκα ἡμερῶν ἐσομένην ὁδόν , ἐν ᾗ οὐδὲν εὑρήσομεν τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ·
for in reckoning it up, I find that there will be more than fifteen days’ journey in which we shall find no provisions at all;


6.2.25
3237
ἀνεσκεύασται γὰρ τὰ μὲν ὑφ’ ἡμῶν , τὰ δ’ ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων ὅσα ἐδύναντο .
for everything there has been made away with: the enemy took all that they could, and we have taken the rest.


6.2.26
3238
συσκευάζεσθαι οὖν χρὴ σῖτον μὲν ἱκανόν ·
Accordingly, we must put up and carry with us food enough;


6.2.26
3239
ἄνευ γὰρ τούτου οὔτε μάχεσθαι οὔτε ζῆν δυναίμεθ’ ἄν ·
for without this we should be unable either to fight or to live.


6.2.26
3240
οἶνον δὲ τοσοῦτον ἕκαστον ἔχειν χρὴ ὅσος ἱκανὸς ἔσται ἐθίσαι ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς ὑδροποτεῖν ·
As for wine, each one ought to take along only enough to last till we accustom ourselves to drinking water;


6.2.26
3241
πολλὴ γὰρ ἔσται τῆς ὁδοῦ ἄοινος , εἰς ἣν οὐδ’ ἂν πάνυ πολὺν οἶνον συσκευασώμεθα , διαρκέσει .
for the greater part of the march will be through a country where there is no wine, and for that all the wine we can carry will not suffice, even if we take along a very great quantity.


6.2.27
3242
ὡς οὖν μὴ ἐξαπίνης ἄοινοι γενόμενοι νοσήμασι περιπίπτωμεν , ὧδε χρὴ ποιεῖν ·
That we may not, therefore, fall a prey to sickness when we suddenly find ourselves deprived of wine, we must take this course:


6.2.27
3243
ἐπὶ μὲν τῷ σίτῳ νῦν εὐθὺς ἀρχώμεθα πίνειν ὕδωρ ·
let us now begin at once to drink water at our meals,


6.2.27
3244
τοῦτο γὰρ ἤδη ποιοῦντες οὐ πολὺ μεταβαλοῦμεν .
for by so doing we shall not greatly change our manner of living.


6.2.28
3245
καὶ γὰρ ὅστις ἀλφιτοσιτεῖ , ὕδατι μεμαγμένην ἀεὶ τὴν μᾶζαν ἐσθίει , καὶ ὅστις ἀρτοσιτεῖ , ὕδατι δεδευμένον τὸν ἄρτον , καὶ τὰ ἑφθὰ δὲ πάντα μεθ’ ὕδατος τοῦ πλείστου ἐσκεύασται .
For whoever eats barley bread always eats meal that has been kneaded up with water, and whoever eats wheaten bread eats of a loaf that was mixed with water;


6.2.28
3246
μετὰ δὲ τὸν σῖτον ἐὰν οἶνον ἐπιπίνωμεν , οὐδὲν μεῖον ἔχουσα ἡ ψυχὴ ἀναπαύσεται .
and everything boiled is prepared with water in very liberal quantities. So, if after the meal we drink some wine, our soul will lack nothing and find refreshment.


6.2.29
3247
ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τοῦ μετὰ δεῖπνον ἀφαιρεῖν χρή , ἔστ’ ἂν λάθωμεν ὑδροπόται γενόμενοι .
But later on we must also gradually diminish the amount taken after dinner,


6.2.29
3248
ἡ γὰρ κατὰ μικρὸν παράλλαξις πᾶσαν ποιεῖ φύσιν ὑποφέρειν τὰς μεταβολάς ·
until unconsciously we have become teetotalers. For gradual transition helps any nature to bear changes.


6.2.29
3249
διδάσκει δὲ καὶ ὁ θεός , ἀπάγων ἡμᾶς κατὰ μικρὸν ἔκ τε τοῦ χειμῶνος εἰς τὸ ἀνέχεσθαι ἰσχυρὰ θάλπη ἔκ τε τοῦ θάλπους εἰς τὸν ἰσχυρὸν χειμῶνα ·
Why, God teaches us that, by leading us gradually from winter to endure the burning heat of summer, and from the heat of summer to the rigours of winter;


6.2.29
3250
ὃν χρὴ μιμουμένους εἰς ὃ δεῖ ἐλθεῖν προειθισμένους ἡμᾶς ἀφικνεῖσθαι .
and we should imitate Him and reach the end we would attain by accustoming ourselves beforehand.


6.2.30
3251
καὶ τὸ τῶν στρωμάτων δὲ βάρος εἰς τ- ἐπιτήδεια καταδαπανᾶτε ·
For your heavy blankets you may substitute an equal weight of provisions;


6.2.30
3252
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἐπιτήδεια περιττεύοντα οὐκ ἄχρηστα ἔσται ·
for excess of provisions will not be useless.


6.2.30
3253
στρωμάτων δὲ ἐνδεηθέντες μὴ δείσητε ὡς οὐχ ἡδέως καθευδήσετε ·
And do not be afraid that you will not sleep soundly for want of your blankets;


6.2.30
3254
εἰ δὲ μή , ἐμὲ αἰτιᾶσθε .
if you do not, I will take the blame.


6.2.30
3255
ἐσθὴς μέντοι ὅτῳ ἐστὶν ἀφθονωτέρα παροῦσα , πολλὰ καὶ ὑγιαίνοντι καὶ κάμνοντι ἐπικουρεῖ .
However, if any one has a generous supply of clothing with him, that will be of good service to him whether he be well or ill.


6.2.31
3256
ὄψα δὲ χρὴ συνεσκευάσθαι ὅσα ἐστὶν ὀξέα καὶ δριμέα καὶ ἁλμυρά ·
For meats, we must pack up and take along only such as are sharp, pungent, salty;


6.2.31
3257
ταῦτα γὰρ ἐπὶ σῖτόν τε ἄγει καὶ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἀρκεῖ .
for these not only stimulate the appetite but also afford the most lasting nourishment.


6.2.31
3258
ὅταν δ’ ἐκβαίνωμεν εἰς ἀκέραια , ὅπου ἤδη εἰκὸς ἡμᾶς σῖτον λαμβάνειν , χειρομύλας χρὴ αὐτόθεν παρασκευάσασθαι αἷς σιτοποιησόμεθα ·
And when we come out into a country that has not been plundered, where we are at once likely to find grain again, we must then have hand-mills ready made with which to prepare food,


6.2.31
3259
τοῦτο γὰρ κουφότατον τῶν σιτοποιικῶν ὀργάνων .
for these are the lightest of the implements used in making bread.


6.2.32
3260
συνεσκευάσθαι δὲ χρὴ καὶ ὧν ἀσθενοῦντες δέονται ἄνθρωποι ·
Again, we must take with us the things that sick people need;


6.2.32
3261
τούτων γὰρ ὁ μὲν ὄγκος μικρότατος , ἢν δὲ τύχη τοιαύτη γένηται , μάλιστα δεήσει .
for the weight they add is very small and, if we have a case of sickness, they will be very necessary.


6.2.32
3262
ἔχειν δὲ χρὴ καὶ ἱμάντας ·
We must also have plenty of straps;


6.2.32
3263
τὰ γὰρ πλεῖστα καὶ ἀνθρώποις καὶ ἵπποις ἱμᾶσιν ἤρτηται ·
for nearly everything that men and horses have is fastened on with straps,


6.2.32
3264
ὧν κατατριβομένων καὶ ῥηγνυμένων ἀνάγκη ἀργεῖν , ἢν μή τις ἔχῃ περίζυγα .
and when these wear out or break, everything must come to a standstill, unless one has some extra ones.


6.2.32
3265
ὅστις δὲ πεπαίδευται καὶ παλτὸν ξύσασθαι , ἀγαθὸν καὶ ξυήλης μὴ ἐπιλαθέσθαι .
And it will be a good thing for the man who has been taught how to smooth down a spear-shaft not to forget a rasp;


6.2.33
3266
ἀγαθὸν δὲ καὶ ῥίνην φέρεσθαι ·
and it will be well to bring along a file too;


6.2.33
3267
ὁ γὰρ λόγχην ἀκονῶν ἐκεῖνος καὶ τὴν ψυχήν τι παρακονᾷ .
for he that whets his spear whets his courage, in a way, at the same time;


6.2.33
3268
ἔπεστι γάρ τις αἰσχύνη λόγχην ἀκονῶντα κακὸν εἶναι .
for a man must be overcome with shame to be whetting his spear and yet feel himself a coward.


6.2.33
3269
ἔχειν δὲ χρὴ καὶ ξύλα περίπλεω καὶ ἅρμασι καὶ ἁμάξαις ·
We must also have a good supply of lumber for the chariots and the wagons,


6.2.33
3270
ἐν γὰρ πολλαῖς πράξεσι πολλὰ ἀνάγκη καὶ τὰ ἀπαγορεύοντα εἶναι .
for from constant use many parts necessarily become defective.


6.2.34
3271
ἔχειν δὲ δεῖ καὶ τὰ ἀναγκαιότατα ὄργανα ἐπὶ ταῦτα πάντα ·
We must have also the most indispensable tools for all these purposes;


6.2.34
3272
οὐ γὰρ πανταχοῦ χειροτέχναι παραγίγνονται ·
for we shall not find mechanics everywhere,


6.2.34
3273
τὸ δ’ ἐφ’ ἡμέραν ἀρκέσον ὀλίγοι τινὲς οἳ οὐχ ἱκανοὶ ποιῆσαι .
and almost any one can make what will serve for a day.


6.2.34
3274
ἔχειν δὲ χρὴ καὶ ἄμην καὶ σμινύην κατὰ ἅμαξαν ἑκάστην , καὶ κατὰ τὸν νωτοφόρον δὲ ἀξίνην καὶ δρέπανον ·
Besides these, we must have a shovel and mattock for every wagon,and for each pack-animal an axe and a sickle;


6.2.34
3275
ταῦτα γὰρ καὶ ἰδίᾳ ἑκάστῳ χρήσιμα καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ κοινοῦ πολλάκις ὠφέλιμα γίγνεται .
for these are useful to each one individually and often serviceable for the common good as well.


6.2.35
3276
τὰ μὲν οὖν εἰς τροφὴν δέοντα οἱ ἡγεμόνες τῶν ὁπλοφόρων ἐξετάζετε τοὺς ὑφ’ ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς ·
As to what is needed for the commissariat, you officers of the armed soldiers must make inquiry of the men under you,


6.2.35
3277
οὐ γὰρ δεῖ παριέναι ὅτου ἄν τις τούτων ἐνδέηται ·
for we must not overlook anything of this sort that any one may need;


6.2.35
3278
ἡμεῖς γὰρ τούτων ἐνδεεῖς ἐσόμεθα .
for it is we that shall feel the want of it, if it is lacking.


6.2.35
3279
ἃ δὲ κατὰ τὰ ὑποζύγια κελεύω ἔχειν , ὑμεῖς οἱ τῶν σκευοφόρων ἄρχοντες ἐξετάζετε , καὶ τὸν μὴ ἔχοντα κατασκευάζεσθαι ἀναγκάζετε .
In reference to what I order for the pack-animals, you officers of the baggage-train must inquire into the matter, and if any man is not properly provided, require him to procure what is lacking.


6.2.36
3280
ὑμεῖς δ’ αὖ οἱ τῶν ὁδοποιῶν ἄρχοντες ἔχετε μὲν ἀπογεγραμμένους παρ’ ἐμοῦ τοὺς ἀποδεδοκιμασμένους καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῶν ἀκοντιστῶν καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῶν τοξοτῶν καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῶν σφενδονητῶν ·
You superintendents of the engineering corps have here from me a list of the spearmen, the archers, and the slingers, whose names have been stricken from the roster.


6.2.36
3281
τούτων δὲ χρὴ τοὺς μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν ἀκοντιστῶν πέλεκυν ἔχοντας ξυλοκόπον ἀναγκάζειν στρατεύεσθαι , τοὺς δ’ ἀπὸ τῶν τοξοτῶν σμινύην , τοὺς δ’ ἀπὸ τῶν σφενδονητῶν ἄμην ·
You must require those of them who were spearmen to carry on the march a woodcutter’s axe, those who were bowmen a mattock, and those who were slingers a shovel.


6.2.36
3282
τούτους δὲ ἔχοντας ταῦτα πρὸ τῶν ἁμαξῶν κατ’ ἴλας πορεύεσθαι , ὅπως ἤν τι δέῃ ὁδοποιίας , εὐθὺς ἐνεργοὶ ἦτε , καὶ ἐγὼ ἤν τι δέωμαι , ὅπως εἰδῶ ὅθεν δεῖ λαβόντα τούτοις χρῆσθαι .
With these tools they are to march in squads ahead of the wagons, so that, in case there is any need of road-building, you may get to work without delay, and so that, if I require their services, I may know where to find them when the time comes.


6.2.37
3283
ἄξω δὲ καὶ τοὺς ἐν τῇ στρατιωτικῇ ἡλικίᾳ σὺν τοῖς ὀργάνοις χαλκέας τε καὶ τέκτονας καὶ σκυτοτόμους , ὅπως ἄν τι δέῃ καὶ τοιούτων τεχνῶν ἐν τῇ στρατιᾷ μηδὲν ἐλλείπηται .
And finally I shall take along those of an age for military service who are smiths and carpenters and cobblers, in order that, if anything is wanted in the army in the line of their trades also, we may not suffer for lack of it.


6.2.37
3284
οὗτοι δὲ ὁπλοφόρου μὲν τάξεως ἀπολελύσονται , ἃ δὲ ἐπίστανται , τῷ βουλομένῳ μισθοῦ ὑπηρετοῦντες ἐν τῷ τεταγμένῳ ἔσονται .
And they shall be relieved of assignments to duty under arms, but they shall occupy the position assigned to them and there ply their trades for pay at the order of whoever wishes their services.


6.2.38
3285
ἢν δέ τις καὶ ἔμπορος βούληται ἕπεσθαι πωλεῖν τι βουλόμενος , τῶν μὲν προειρημένων ἡμερῶν τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἔχειν ἤν τι πωλῶν ἁλίσκηται , πάντων στερήσεται ·
And any merchant who wishes to accompany us, seeking a market for his wares, may do so;


6.2.38
3286
ἐπειδὰν δ’ αὗται παρέλθωσιν αἱ ἡμέραι , πωλήσει ὅπως ἂν βούληται .
but if he is caught trying to sell anything within the number of days for which the troops are ordered to furnish their own provisions, he shall have all his goods confiscated.


6.2.38
3287
ὅστις δ’ ἂν τῶν ἐμπόρων πλείστην ἀγορὰν παρέχων φαίνηται , οὗτος καὶ παρὰ τῶν συμμάχων καὶ παρ’ ἐμοῦ δώρων καὶ τιμῆς τεύξεται .
But when those days are past, he may sell as he pleases. And the man who seems to offer the largest stock of goods shall receive rewards and preferment both from the allies and from myself.


6.2.39
3288
εἰ δέ τις χρημάτων προσδεῖσθαι νομίζει εἰς ἐμπολήν , γνωστῆρας ἐμοὶ προσαγαγὼν καὶ ἐγγυητὰς ἦ μὴν πορεύσεσθαι σὺν τῇ στρατιᾷ , λαμβανέτω ὧν ἡμεῖς ἔχομεν .
And if any merchant thinks he needs more money for the purchase of supplies, let him bring me vouchers for his respectability and identity, and sureties as a pledge that he is really going with the army, and he shall receive a certain amount from the fund we have.


6.2.39
3289
ἐγὼ μὲν δὴ ταῦτα προαγορεύω ·
These are the directions I have to give in advance.


6.2.39
3290
εἰ δέ τίς τι καὶ ἄλλο δέον ἐνορᾷ , πρὸς ἐμὲ σημαινέτω .
If any one thinks of anything else that we need, let him inform me of it.


6.2.40
3291
καὶ ὑμεῖς μὲν ἀπιόντες συσκευάζεσθε , ἐγὼ δὲ θύσομαι ἐπὶ τῇ ὁρμῇ ·
Now do you go and make ready, and I will sacrifice for a blessing upon our start;


6.2.40
3292
ὅταν δὲ τὰ τῶν θεῶν καλῶς ἔχῃ , σημανοῦμεν .
and when the omens from the gods are favourable, we shall give the signal,


6.2.40
3293
παρεῖναι δὲ χρὴ ἅπαντας τὰ προειρημένα ἔχοντας εἰς τὴν τεταγμένην χώραν πρὸς τοὺς ἡγεμόνας αὐτῶν .
and all must come equipped with what has been prescribed and join their own commanders at the place appointed.


6.2.41
3294
ὑμεῖς δὲ οἱ ἡγεμόνες τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἕκαστος τάξιν εὐτρεπισάμενος πρὸς ἐμὲ πάντες συμβάλλετε , ἵνα τὰς ἑαυτῶν ἕκαστοι χώρας καταμάθητε .
And all of you officers, when you have made ready each his own division, come to me that you may acquaint yourselves with your several positions.


6.3.1
3295
ἀκούσαντες δὲ ταῦτα οἱ μὲν συνεσκευάζοντο , ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐθύετο .
When they heard this they began to make ready for the march, and Cyrus proceeded to sacrifice;


6.3.1
3296
ἐπεὶ δὲ καλὰ τὰ ἱερὰ ἦν , ὡρμᾶτο σὺν τῷ στρατεύματι ·
and when the omens of the sacrifice were favourable, he set out with the army.


6.3.1
3297
καὶ τῇ μὲν πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἐξεστρατοπεδεύσατο ὡς δυνατὸν ἐγγύτατα , ὅπως εἴ τίς τι ἐπιλελησμένος εἴη , μετέλθοι , καὶ εἴ τίς τι ἐνδεόμενος γνοίη , τοῦτο ἐπιπαρασκευάσαιτο .
On the first day he left the position he had occupied and encamped again as near as convenient to it. This he did, in order that, in case any one had forgotten anything, he might go back after it; and if any one discovered that he needed anything, he might still procure it.


6.3.2
3298
Κυαξάρης μὲν οὖν τῶν Μήδων ἔχων τὸ τρίτον μέρος κατέμενεν , ὡς μηδὲ τὰ οἴκοι ἔρημα εἴη .
Cyaxares, however, remained behind with one third of the Medes, so as not to leave the home country unprotected,


6.3.2
3299
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐπορεύετο ὡς ἐδύνατο τάχιστα , τοὺς ἱππέας μὲν πρώτους ἔχων , καὶ πρὸ τούτων διερευνητὰς καὶ σκοποὺς αἰεὶ ἀναβιβάζων ἐπὶ τὰ πρόσθεν εὐσκοπώτατα ·
while Cyrus, with the cavalry at the head of the line, marched as rapidly as possible; but he never failed to send patrols ahead, and scouts up to the heights commanding the widest view before them.


6.3.2
3300
μετὰ δὲ τούτους ἦγε τὰ σκευοφόρα , ὅπου μὲν πεδινὸν εἴη , πολλοὺς ὁρμαθοὺς ποιούμενος τῶν ἁμαξῶν καὶ τῶν σκευοφόρων ·
After these he arranged the baggage train, and where the country was flat he arranged many lines of wagons and pack-animals abreast;


6.3.2
3301
ὄπισθεν δὲ ἡ φάλαγξ ἐφεπομένη , εἴ τι τῶν σκευοφόρων ὑπολείποιτο , οἱ προστυγχάνοντες τῶν ἀρχόντων ἐπεμέλοντο ὡς μὴ κωλύοιντο πορεύεσθαι .
the phalanx followed next, and if any part of the baggage train lagged behind, such of the officers as happened to be at hand took care that they and their men should not be retarded in their advance.


6.3.3
3302
ὅπου δὲ στενωτέρα εἴη ἡ ὁδός , διὰ μέσου ποιούμενοι τὰ σκευοφόρα ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν ἐπορεύοντο οἱ ὁπλοφόροι ·
But when the road was narrower, the soldiers put the baggage in between their lines and marched on either side of it;


6.3.3
3303
καὶ εἴ τι ἐμποδίζοι , οἱ κατὰ ταῦτα γιγνόμενοι τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἐπεμέλοντο .
and if they met with any hindrance, those of the soldiers who were near the place took the matter in hand.


6.3.3
3304
ἐπορεύοντο δὲ ὡς τὰ πολλὰ αἱ τάξεις παρ’ ἑαυταῖς ἔχουσαι τὰ σκευοφόρα ·
For the most part, the companies marched with their own baggage next to them;


6.3.3
3305
ἐπετέτακτο γὰρ πᾶσι τοῖς σκευοφόροις κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἑκάστους τάξιν ἰέναι , εἰ μή τι ἀναγκαῖον ἀποκωλύοι .
for the baggage captains had orders to go along with their own respective companies unless something unavoidable should prevent it.


6.3.4
3306
καὶ σημεῖον δὲ ἔχων ὁ τοῦ ταξιάρχου σκευοφόρος ἡγεῖτο γνωστὸν τοῖς τῆς ἑαυτοῦ τάξεως ·
And the baggage man of each captain went ahead bearing an ensign that was known to the men of his own company.


6.3.4
3307
ὥστε ἁθρόοι ἐπορεύοντο , ἐπεμελοῦντό τε ἰσχυρῶς ἕκαστος τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ὡς μὴ ὑπολείποιντο .
They were thus enabled to march close together, and they were extremely careful, each of his own property, that nothing should be left behind.


6.3.4
3308
καὶ οὕτω ποιούντων οὔτε ζητεῖν ἔδει ἀλλήλους ἅμα τε παρόντα ἅπαντα καὶ σαώτερα ἦν καὶ θᾶττον τὰ δέοντα εἶχον οἱ στρατιῶται .
As they maintained this order, it was never necessary for them to look for one another, and at the same time everything was kept close at hand and in greater safety, and the soldiers always obtained more promptly anything that was wanted.


6.3.5
3309
ὡς δ’ οἱ προϊόντες σκοποὶ ἔδοξαν ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ὁρᾶν ἀνθρώπους λαμβάνοντας καὶ χιλὸν καὶ ξύλα , καὶ ὑποζύγια δὲ ἑώρων ἕτερα τοιαῦτα ἄγοντα , τὰ δὲ καὶ νεμόμενα , καὶ τὰ πρόσω αὖ ἀφορῶντες ἐδόκουν καταμανθάνειν μετεωριζόμενον ἢ καπνὸν ἢ κονιορτόν , ἐκ τούτων πάντων σχεδὸν ἐγίγνωσκον ὅτι εἴη που πλησίον τὸ στράτευμα τῶν πολεμίων .
Now the scouts who went forward thought they saw men getting fodder and fuel on the plain; and they also saw beasts of burden, some loaded with other supplies of that sort and others grazing. Then, as they looked further on into the distance, they thought that they detected smoke or a cloud of dust rising up. From all these evidences they pretty well recognised that the army of the enemy was somewhere in the neighbourhood.


6.3.6
3310
εὐθὺς οὖν πέμπει τινὰ ὁ σκόπαρχος ἀγγελοῦντα ταῦτα τῷ Κύρῳ .
Accordingly, the officer in command of the scouts at once sent a man to report the news to Cyrus;


6.3.6
3311
ὁ δὲ ἀκούσας ταῦτα ἐκείνους μὲν ἐκέλευσε μένοντας ἐπὶ ταύταις ταῖς σκοπαῖς ὅ τι ἂν ἀεὶ καινὸν ὁρῶσιν ἐξαγγέλλειν ·
and when he heard it he ordered them to remain at their look-out place and send him reports from time to time of whatever they saw that was new.


6.3.6
3312
τάξιν δ’ ἔπεμψεν ἱππέων εἰς τὸ πρόσθεν καὶ ἐκέλευσε πειραθῆναι συλλαβεῖν τινας τῶν ἀνὰ τὸ πεδίον ἀνθρώπων , ὅπως σαφέστερον μάθοιεν τὸ ὄν .
Moreover, he sent forward a company of cavalry with orders to try to capture some of the men moving up and down the plain, in order that he might learn more definitely the real state of affairs. Accordingly, those who received these orders proceeded to execute them.


6.3.7
3313
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταχθέντες τοῦτο ἔπραττον .
And those who made the raid into the plain had captured some people and now brought them in;


6.3.7
3314
αὐτὸς δὲ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα αὐτοῦ κατεχώριζεν , ὅπως παρασκευάσαιντο ὅσα ᾤετο χρῆναι πρὶν πάνυ ὁμοῦ εἶναι .
and the prisoners, when cross-questioned by Cyrus, said that they were from the camp and had come out after fodder, passing out beyond their advanced guards, while others had gone after fuel;


6.3.7
3315
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ἀριστᾶν παρηγγύησεν , ἔπειτα δὲ μένοντας ἐν ταῖς τάξεσι τὸ παραγγελλόμενον προνοεῖν ·
for by reason of the vast numbers of their army, everything was scarce.


6.3.8
3316
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠρίστησαν , συνεκάλεσε καὶ ἱππέων καὶ πεζῶν καὶ ἁρμάτων ἡγεμόνας , καὶ τῶν μηχανῶν δὲ καὶ τῶν σκευοφόρων τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τῶν ἁρμαμαξῶν ·
He himself halted the rest of the army there, so that they might make what preparations he considered necessary before they were in too close quarters.


6.3.8
3317
καὶ οὗτοι μὲν συνῇσαν .
And he gave the word to take luncheon first and then to remain at their posts and be on the watch for orders.


6.3.9
3318
οἱ δὲ καταδραμόντες εἰς τὸ πεδίον συλλαβόντες ἀνθρώπους ἤγαγον ·
So, when they had eaten, he summoned together the commanders of the cavalry, the infantry, and the chariot corps, and also the officers in charge of the engines, of the baggage train, and of the wagons, and they came.


6.3.9
3319
οἱ δὲ ληφθέντες ἀνερωτώμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ Κύρου ἔλεγον ὅτι ἀπὸ τοῦ στρατοπέδου εἶεν , προεληλυθότες ἐπὶ χιλόν , οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ ξύλα , παρελθόντες τὰς προφυλακάς ·
And those who made the raid into the plain had captured some people and now brought them in;


6.3.9
3320
διὰ γὰρ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ στρατοῦ σπάνια πάντ’ εἶναι .
and the prisoners, when cross-questioned by Cyrus, said that they were from the camp and had come out after fodder, passing out beyond their advanced guards, while others had gone after fuel; for by reason of the vast numbers of their army, everything was scarce.


6.3.10
3321
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ταῦτα ἀκούσας , πόσον δέ , ἔφη , ἄπεστιν ἐνθένδε τὸ στράτευμα ;
On hearing this, Cyrus asked: How far from here is your army?


6.3.10
3322
οἱ δ’ ἔλεγον ·
They replied:


6.3.10
3323
ὡς δύο παρασάγγας .
About two parasangs,


6.3.10
3324
ἐπὶ τούτοις ἤρετο ὁ Κύρος ·
Cyrus then asked.


6.3.10
3325
ἡμῶν δ’ , ἔφη , λόγος τις ἦν παρ’ αὐτοῖς ;
Was there any talk about us over there?


6.3.10
3326
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφασαν , καὶ πολύς γε ὡς ἐγγὺς ἤδη εἶτε προσιόντες .
Yes, by Zeus, they answered, a great deal, and to the effect that you were already close upon us in your advance.


6.3.10
3327
τί οὖν ;
Tell me, then,


6.3.10
3328
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ἦ καὶ ἔχαιρον ἀκούοντες ἰόντας ;
said Cyrus, were they glad when they heard we were coming?


6.3.10
3329
τοῦτο δὲ ἐπήρετο τῶν παρόντων ἕνεκα .
This question he asked for the benefit of the bystanders.


6.3.10
3330
οὐ μὰ Δί’ , εἶπον ἐκεῖνοι , οὐ μὲν δὴ ἔχαιρον , ἀλλὰ καὶ μάλα ἠνιῶντο .
No, by Zeus, they answered; they were not glad in the least, but were rather very much troubled.


6.3.11
3331
νῦν δ’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , τί ποιοῦσιν ;
And what are they doing now? asked Cyrus.


6.3.11
3332
ἐκτάττονται , ἔφασαν ·
They are being marshalled in battle array, they answered.


6.3.11
3333
καὶ ἐχθὲς δὲ καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἔπραττον .
And yesterday and the day before they were doing the same.


6.3.11
3334
ὁ δὲ τάττων , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , τίς ἐστιν ;
And the marshal, said Cyrus, who is he?


6.3.11
3335
οἱ δὲ ἔφασαν ·
Croesus himself, they replied,


6.3.11
3336
αὐτός τε Κροῖσος καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ Ἕλλην τις ἀνήρ , καὶ ἄλλος δέ τις Μῆδος ·
and with him a Greek and some one else — a Mede; the latter, however, was said to be a deserter from your side.


6.3.11
3337
οὗτος μέντοι ἐλέγετο φυγὰς εἶναι παρ’ ὑμῶν .
Grant, O Zeus almighty,


6.3.11
3338
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
said Cyrus,


6.3.11
3339
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Ζεῦ μέγιστε , λαβεῖν μοι γένοιτο αὐτὸν ὡς ἐγὼ βούλομαι .
that it be mine to get hold of him, as I desire!


6.3.12
3340
ἐκ τούτου τοὺς μὲν αἰχμαλώτους ἀπάγειν ἐκέλευσεν , εἰς δὲ τοὺς παρόντας ὡς λέξων τι ἀνήγετο .
Then he ordered the prisoners to be led away,


6.3.12
3341
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ παρῆν ἄλλος αὖ παρὰ τοῦ σκοπάρχου , λέγων ὅτι ἱππέων τάξις μεγάλη ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ προφαίνοιτο ·
and turned to the bystanders as if to say something.


6.3.12
3342
καὶ ἡμεῖς μέν , ἔφη , εἰκάζομεν ἐλαύνειν αὐτοὺς βουλομένους ἰδεῖν τόδε τὸ στράτευμα .
But at that moment another messenger came from the captain of the scouts with word that a large body of cavalry was within sight on the plain.


6.3.12
3343
καὶ γὰρ πρὸ τῆς τάξεως ταύτης ἄλλοι ὡς τριάκοντα ἱππεῖς συχνὸν προελαύνουσι , καὶ μέντοι , ἔφη , κατ’ αὐτοὺς ἡμᾶς , ἴσως βουλόμενοι λαβεῖν , ἢν δύνωνται , τὴν σκοπήν ·
And we presume, he added, that they are coming with the intention of reconnoitring the army here.


6.3.12
3344
ἡμεῖς δ’ ἐσμὲν μία δεκὰς οἱ ἐπὶ ταύτης τῆς σκοπῆς .
And we have good reasons for the suspicion, for at a considerable distance in advance of this company about thirty other horsemen are riding forward; as a matter of fact, they are riding in the direction of our party, aiming perhaps, if possible, to get possession of our look-out point; and we who are holding this particular point are only ten in number.


6.3.13
3345
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἐκέλευσε τῶν περὶ αὐτὸν ἀεὶ ὄντων ἱππέων ἐλάσαντας ὑπὸ τὴν σκοπὴν ἀδήλους τοῖς πολεμίοις ἀτρεμίαν ἔχειν .
So Cyrus ordered a detachment of the horsemen who formed his body-guard to ride up to the foot of the place of look-out and to remain quiet there out of sight of the enemy.


6.3.13
3346
ὅταν δ’ , ἔφη , ἡ δεκὰς ἡ ἡμετέρα λείπῃ τὴν σκοπήν , ἐξαναστάντες ἐπίθεσθε τοῖς ἀναβαίνουσιν ἐπὶ τὴν σκοπήν .
But, he added, when our ten leave the look-out place, rush up and attack the enemy as they come up it.


6.3.13
3347
ὡς δὲ ὑμᾶς μὴ λυπῶσιν οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς μεγάλης τάξεως , ἀντέξελθε σύ , ἔφη , ὦ Ὑστάσπα , τὴν χιλιοστὺν τῶν ἱππέων λαβὼν καὶ ἐπιφάνηθι ἐναντίος τῇ τῶν πολεμίων τάξει .
But that the horsemen of the large battalion may not bring you to grief, do you, Hystaspas, said he to that officer, take your regiment of cavalry, go out against them, and show yourself over against the enemy’s battalion.


6.3.13
3348
διώξῃς δὲ μηδαμῇ εἰς ἀφανές , ἀλλ’ ὅπως αἱ σκοπαί σοι διαμένωσιν ἐπιμεληθεὶς πάριθι .
But do not by any means allow yourself to pursue into places that you do not know, but when you have made sure that the look-out stations remain in your possession, come back.


6.3.13
3349
ἂν δ’ ἄρα ἀνατείναντές τινες τὰς δεξιὰς προσελαύνωσιν ὑμῖν , δέχεσθε φιλίως τοὺς ἄνδρας .
And if any ride toward you, holding up their right hands, receive them as friends.


6.3.14
3350
ὁ μὲν δὴ Ὑστάσπας ἀπιὼν ὡπλίζετο ·
Accordingly, Hystaspas went away and donned his armour;


6.3.14
3351
οἱ δ’ ὑπηρέται ἤλαυνον εὐθὺς ὡς ἐκέλευσεν .
the men from Cyrus’s body-guard rode off at once, as he had ordered.


6.3.14
3352
ἀπαντᾷ δ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ δὴ ἐντὸς τῶν σκοπῶν σὺν τοῖς θεράπουσιν ὁ πεμφθεὶς πάλαι κατάσκοπος , ὁ φύλαξ τῆς Σουσίδος γυναικός .
And just within the picket line there met them, with his attendants, the man who had been sent some time since as a spy, the guardian of the lady of Susa.


6.3.15
3353
ὁ μὲν οὖν Κῦρος ὡς ἤκουσεν , ἀναπηδήσας ἐκ τῆς ἕδρας ὑπήντα τε αὐτῷ καὶ ἐδεξιοῦτο ·
So when Cyrus heard this, he sprang up from his seat, went to meet him, and welcomed him cordially;


6.3.15
3354
οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι , ὥσπερ εἰκὸς μηδὲν εἰδότας , ἐκπεπληγμένοι ἦσαν τῷ πράγματι , ἕως Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
and the rest, knowing nothing of the facts, were naturally astonished at his actions until Cyrus said:


6.3.15
3355
ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἥκει ἡμῖν ἀνὴρ ἄριστος .
My friends, here has come a man most loyal;


6.3.15
3356
νῦν γὰρ ἤδη πάντας ἀνθρώπους δεῖ εἰδέναι τὰ τούτου ἔργα .
for now all the world must know at once what he has done.


6.3.15
3357
οὗτος οὔτε αἰσχροῦ ἡττηθεὶς οὐδενὸς ᾤχετο οὔτ’ ἐμὲ φοβηθείς , ἀλλ’ ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ πεμφθεὶς ὅπως ἡμῖν μαθὼν τὰ τῶν πολεμίων σαφῶς τὰ ὄντα ἐξαγγείλειεν .
He went away not because his disgrace was too great for him to bear, nor because he feared my displeasure, but because I sent him to discover for us the exact condition of the enemy and to report to us the true state of affairs.


6.3.16
3358
ἃ μὲν οὖν ἐγώ σοι ὑπεσχόμην , ὦ Ἀράσπα , μέμνημαί τε καὶ ἀποδώσω σὺν τούτοις πᾶσι .
And now, Araspas, I have not forgotten what I promised you, and I will fulfil it, and all these men shall help me;


6.3.16
3359
δίκαιον δὲ καὶ ὑμᾶς ἅπαντας , ὦ ἄνδρες , τοῦτον τιμᾶν ὡς ἀγαθὸν ἄνδρα ·
for it is only right, my friends, that you also should all honour him as a valiant man.


6.3.16
3360
ἐπὶ γὰρ τῷ ἡμετέρῳ ἀγαθῷ καὶ ἐκινδύνευσε καὶ αἰτίαν ὑπέσχεν , ᾗ ἐβαρύνετο .
For, for our general good, he has risked his life and borne the stigma that was put upon him.


6.3.17
3361
ἐκ τούτου δὴ πάντες ἠσπάζοντο τὸν Ἀράσπαν καὶ ἐδεξιοῦντο .
Then all embraced Araspas and gave him a hearty welcome.


6.3.17
3362
εἰπόντος δὲ Κύρου ὅτι τούτων μὲν τοίνυν εἴη ἅλις , ἃ δὲ καιρὸς ἡμῖν εἰδέναι , ταῦτ’ , ἔφη , διηγοῦ , ὦ Ἀράσπα ·
But Cyrus, remarking that there had been enough of that, added, Tell us, Araspas, what it is of the first importance for us to know;


6.3.17
3363
καὶ μηδὲν ἐλάττου τοῦ ἀληθοῦς μηδὲ μείου τὰ τῶν πολεμίων .
and do not detract anything from the truth nor underrate the real strength of the enemy.


6.3.17
3364
κρεῖττον γὰρ μείζω οἰηθέντας μείονα ἰδεῖν ἢ μείω ἀκούσαντας ἰσχυρότερα εὑρίσκειν .
For it is better for us to think it greater and find it less than to hear that it is less and find it really more formidable.


6.3.18
3365
καὶ μήν , ἔφη ὁ Ἀράσπας , ὡς ἂν ἀσφαλέστατά γε εἰδείην ὁπόσον τὸ στράτευμά ἐστιν ἐποίουν ·
Aye said Araspas, but I did take steps to get the most accurate information about the size of their army;


6.3.18
3366
συνεξέταττον γὰρ παρὼν αὐτός .
for I was present in person and helped to draw it up in battle order.


6.3.18
3367
σὺ μὲν ἄρα , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , οὐ τὸ πλῆθος μόνον οἶσθα , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν τάξιν αὐτῶν .
And so, said Cyrus, you are acquainted not only with their numbers but also with their order of battle.


6.3.18
3368
ἐγὼ μὲν ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Ἀράσπας , καὶ ὡς διανοοῦνται τὴν μάχην ποιεῖσθαι .
Yes, by Zeus, answered Araspas, I am; and I know also how they are planning to conduct the battle.


6.3.18
3369
ἀλλ’ ὅμως , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , τὸ πλῆθος ἡμῖν πρῶτον εἰπὲ ἐν κεφαλαίῳ .
Good said Cyrus; still, tell us first, in round numbers, how many of them there are.


6.3.19
3370
ἐκεῖνοι τοίνυν , ἔφη , πάντες τεταγμένοι ἐπὶ τριάκοντα τὸ βάθος καὶ πεζοὶ καὶ ἱππεῖς πλὴν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἐπέχουσιν ἀμφὶ τὰ τετταράκοντα στάδια ·
Well, he replied, with the exception of the Egyptians, they are all drawn up thirty deep, both foot and horse, and their front extends about forty stadia;


6.3.19
3371
πάνυ γάρ μοι , ἔφη , ἐμέλησεν ὥστε εἰδέναι ὁπόσον κατεῖχον χωρίον .
for I took especial pains to find out how much space they covered.


6.3.20
3372
οἱ δ’ Αἰγύπτιοι , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , πῶς εἰσι τεταγμένοι ;
And how are the Egyptians drawn up? asked Cyrus;


6.3.20
3373
ὅτι εἶπας πλὴν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων .
for you said with the exception of the Egyptians.


6.3.20
3374
τούτους δὲ οἱ μυρίαρχοι ἔταττον εἰς ἑκατὸν πανταχῇ τὴν μυριοστὺν ἑκάστην ·
The brigadier-generals drew them up — each one ten thousand men, a hundred square;


6.3.20
3375
τοῦτον γὰρ σφίσι καὶ οἴκοι νόμον ἔφασαν εἶναι τῶν τάξεων .
for this, they said, was their manner of arranging their order of battle at home.


6.3.20
3376
καὶ ὁ Κροῖσος μέντοι μάλα ἄκων συνεχώρησεν αὐτοῖς οὕτω τάττεσθαι ·
And Croesus consented to their being so drawn up, but very reluctantly,


6.3.20
3377
ἐβούλετο γὰρ ὅτι πλεῖστον ὑπερφαλαγγῆσαι τοῦ σοῦ στρατεύματος .
for he wished to outflank your army as much as possible.


6.3.20
3378
πρὸς τί δή , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , τοῦτο ἐπιθυμῶν ;
And what is his object in doing that, pray?


6.3.20
3379
ὡς ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , τῷ περιττῷ κυκλωσόμενος .
In order, by Zeus, he replied, to surround you with the part that extends beyond your line.


6.3.20
3380
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
asked Cyrus.


6.3.20
3381
ἀλλ’ οὔτοι ἂν εἰδεῖεν εἰ οἱ κυκλούμενοι κυκλωθεῖεν .
Well, said Cyrus, they may have an opportunity to find out whether the surrounders may not be surrounded.


6.3.21
3382
ἀλλ’ ἃ μὲν παρὰ σοῦ καιρὸς μαθεῖν , ἀκηκόαμεν ·
Now we have heard from you what it is of the first importance for us to learn.


6.3.21
3383
ὑμᾶς δὲ χρή , ὦ ἄνδρες , οὕτω ποιεῖν ·
And you, my men, must carry out the following programme:


6.3.21
3384
νῦν μὲν ἐπειδὰν ἐνθένδε ἀπέλθητε , ἐπισκέψασθε καὶ τὰ τῶν ἵππων καὶ τὰ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν ὅπλα ·
when you leave me, look at once to your own accoutrement and that of your horses;


6.3.21
3385
πολλάκις γὰρ μικροῦ ἐνδείᾳ καὶ ἀνὴρ καὶ ἵππος καὶ ἅρμα ἀχρεῖον γίγνεται ·
for often, for want of a trifle, man or horse or chariot becomes useless.


6.3.21
3386
αὔριον δὲ πρῴ , ἕως ἂν ἐγὼ θύωμαι , πρῶτον μὲν χρὴ ἀριστῆσαι καὶ ἄνδρας καὶ ἵππους , ὅπως ὅ τι ἂν πράττειν ἀεὶ καιρὸς ᾖ μὴ τούτου ἡμῖν ἐνδέῃ ·
And early to-morrow morning, during the time that I shall be sacrificing, first you must all breakfast, both men and horses, so that we may not fail in anything that it may be of importance for us to do in any exigency.


6.3.21
3387
ἔπειτα δὲ σύ , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρσάμα , G? , τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας ἔχε ὥσπερ καὶ ἔχεις , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι μυρίαρχοι ᾗπερ νῦν ἔχετε ·
And then do you, Arsamas, take charge of the right wing, as you always have done, and the rest of you brigadier-generals take the posts you now have.


6.3.21
3388
ὁμοῦ δὲ τοῦ ἀγῶνος ὄντος οὐδενὶ ἅρματι καιρὸς ἵππους μεταζευγνύναι .
When the race is on, it is not the time for any chariot to change horses.


6.3.21
3389
παραγγείλατε δὲ τοῖς ταξιάρχοις καὶ λοχαγοῖς ἐπὶ φάλαγγος καθίστασθαι εἰς δύο ἔχοντας ἕκαστον τὸν λόχον .
So instruct your captains and lieutenants to form a line with each separate platoon two deep.


6.3.21
3390
ὁ δὲ λόχος ἦν ἕκαστος εἴκοσι τέτταρες .
Now each platoon contained twenty-four men.


6.3.22
3391
καί τις εἶπε τῶν μυριάρχων ·
And one of the generals said:


6.3.22
3392
καὶ δοκοῦμέν σοι , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ἱκανῶς ἕξειν εἰς τοσούτους τεταγμένοι πρὸς οὕτω βαθεῖαν φάλαγγα ;
Do you think, Cyrus, that drawn up with lines so shallow we shall be a match for so deep a phalanx?


6.3.22
3393
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
When phalanxes are too deep to reach the enemy with weapons, answered Cyrus,


6.3.22
3394
αἱ δὲ βαθύτεραι φάλαγγες ἢ ὡς ἐξικνεῖσθαι τοῖς ὅπλοις τῶν ἐναντίων τί σοι , ἔφη , δοκοῦσιν ἢ τοὺς πολεμίους βλάπτειν ἢ τοὺς συμμάχους ὠφελεῖν ;
how do you think they can either hurt their enemy or help their friends?


6.3.23
3395
ἐγὼ μὲν γάρ , ἔφη , τοὺς εἰς ἑκατὸν τούτους ὁπλίτας εἰς μυρίους ἂν μᾶλλον βουλοίμην τετάχθαι ·
For my part, I would rather have these hoplites who are arranged in columns a hundred deep drawn up ten thousand deep;


6.3.23
3396
οὕτω γὰρ ἂν ἐλαχίστοις μαχοίμεθα .
for in that case we should have very few to fight against.


6.3.23
3397
ἐξ ὅσων μέντοι ἐγὼ τὴν φάλαγγα βαθυνῶ οἴομαι ὅλην ἐνεργὸν καὶ σύμμαχον ποιήσειν αὐτὴν ἑαυτῇ .
According to the depth that I shall give my line of battle, I think I shall bring the entire line into action and make it everywhere mutually helpful.


6.3.24
3398
ἀκοντιστὰς μὲν ἐπὶ τοῖς θωρακοφόροις τάξω , ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς ἀκοντισταῖς τοὺς τοξότας .
I shall bring up the spearmen immediately behind the heavy-armed troops,


6.3.24
3399
τούτους γὰρ πρωτοστάτας μὲν τί ἄν τις τάττοι , οἳ καὶ αὐτοὶ ὁμολογοῦσι μηδεμίαν μάχην ἂν ὑπομεῖναι ἐκ χειρός ;
and the bowmen immediately behind the spearmen;


6.3.24
3400
προβεβλημένοι δὲ τοὺς θωρακοφόρους μενοῦσί τε , καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀκοντίζοντες , οἱ δὲ τοξεύοντες , ὑπὲρ τῶν πρόσθεν πάντων λυμανοῦνται τοὺς πολεμίους .
for why should any one put in the front ranks those who themselves acknowledge that they could never withstand the shock of battle in a hand-to-hand encounter?


6.3.24
3401
ὅ τι δ’ ἂν κακουργῇ τις τοὺς ἐναντίους , δῆλον ὅτι παντὶ τούτῳ τοὺς συμμάχους κουφίζει .
But with the heavy-armed troops as a shield in front of them, they will stand their ground; and the one division with their spears, the other with their arrows will rain destruction upon the enemy, over the heads of all the lines in front. And whatever harm any one does to the enemy, in all this he obviously lightens the task of his comrades.


6.3.25
3402
τελευταίους μέντοι στήσω τοὺς ἐπὶ πᾶσι καλουμένους .
Behind all the rest I shall station the so-called rear-guard of veteran reserves.


6.3.25
3403
ὥσπερ γὰρ οἰκίας οὔτε ἄνευ λιθολογήματος ὀχυροῦ οὔτε ἄνευ τῶν στέγειν ποιούντων οὐδὲν ὄφελος , οὕτως οὐδὲ φάλαγγος οὔτ’ ἄνευ τῶν πρώτων οὔτ’ ἄνευ τῶν τελευταίων , εἰ μὴ ἀγαθοὶ ἔσονται , ὄφελος οὐδέν .
For just as a house, without a strong foundation or without the things that make a roof, is good for nothing, so likewise a phalanx is good for nothing, unless both front and rear are composed of valiant men.


6.3.26
3404
ἀλλ’ ὑμεῖς τ’ , ἔφη , ὡς παραγγέλλω τάττεσθε , καὶ ὑμεῖς οἱ τῶν πελταστῶν ἄρχοντες ἐπὶ τούτοις ὡσαύτως τοὺς λόχους καθίστατε , καὶ ὑμεῖς οἱ τῶν τοξοτῶν ἐπὶ τοῖς πελτασταῖς ὡσαύτως .
Do you, therefore, take your positions as I direct, and you also, the officers of the light-armed troops, bring up your platoons immediately behind them, and you, the officers of the archery, fall in, in the same way, directly behind the light-armed troops.


6.3.27
3405
σὺ δέ , ὃς τῶν ἐπὶ πᾶσιν ἄρχεις , τελευταίους ἔχων τοὺς ἄνδρας παράγγελλε τοῖς σαυτοῦ ἐφορᾶν τε ἑκάστῳ τοὺς καθ’ αὑτὸν καὶ τοῖς μὲν τὸ δέον ποιοῦσιν ἐπικελεύειν , τοῖς δὲ μαλακυνομένοις ἀπειλεῖν ἰσχυρῶς ·
Now you, the commander of the rear-guard, as you are behind all the rest with your men, issue orders to your own division that each man watch those immediately in front of him, encourage those who are doing their duty, threaten violently those who lag behind,


6.3.27
3406
ἢν δέ τις στρέφηται προδιδόναι θέλων , θανάτῳ ζημιοῦν .
and punish with death any one who turns his back with traitorous intent.


6.3.27
3407
ἔργον γάρ ἐστι τοῖς μὲν πρωτοστάταις θαρρύνειν τοὺς ἑπομένους καὶ λόγῳ καὶ ἔργῳ ·
For it is the duty of the men in the front ranks with word and deed to encourage those who follow them,


6.3.27
3408
ὑμᾶς δὲ δεῖ τοὺς ἐπὶ πᾶσι τεταγμένους πλείω φόβον παρέχειν τοῖς κακοῖς τοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων .
while it is your business, who occupy the rear, to inspire the cowardly with greater fear than the enemy does.


6.3.28
3409
καὶ ὑμεῖς μὲν ταῦτα ποιεῖτε .
That is what you have to attend to.


6.3.28
3410
σὺ δέ , ὦ Εὐφράτα , ὃς ἄρχεις τῶν ἐπὶ ταῖς μηχαναῖς , οὕτω ποίει ὅπως τὰ ζεύγη τὰ τοὺς πύργους ἄγοντα ἕψεται ὡς ἐγγύτατα τῆς φάλαγγος .
Now you, Euphratas, who are commander of the division in charge of the engines, manage to have the teams that draw the towers follow as close as possible behind the phalanx.


6.3.29
3411
σὺ δ’ , ὦ Δαοῦχε , ὃς ἄρχεις τῶν σκευοφόρων , ἐπὶ τοῖς πύργοις ἄγε πάντα τὸν τοιοῦτον στρατόν ·
And you, Daüchus, who have command of the baggage-train, bring up all your division of the army next after the towers,


6.3.29
3412
οἱ δὲ ὑπηρέται σου ἰσχυρῶς κολαζόντων τοὺς προϊόντας τοῦ καιροῦ ἢ λειπομένους .
and let your adjutants punish severely those who advance or fall behind further than is expedient.


6.3.30
3413
σὺ δέ , ὦ Καρδοῦχε , ὃς ἄρχεις τῶν ἁρμαμαξῶν αἳ ἄγουσι τὰς γυναῖκας , κατάστησον αὐτὰς τελευταίας ἐπὶ τοῖς σκευοφόροις .
And you, Carduchus, who have charge of the carriages which convey the women, bring them up in the rear next after the baggage-train.


6.3.30
3414
ἑπόμενα γὰρ ταῦτα πάντα καὶ πλήθους δόξαν παρέξει καὶ ἐνεδρεύειν ἡμῖν ἐξουσία ἔσται , καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους , ἢν κυκλοῦσθαι πειρῶνται , μείζω τὴν περιβολὴν ἀναγκάσει ποιεῖσθαι ·
For, if all this follows, it will give an impression of numbers and will afford us an opportunity for an ambuscade; and if the enemy try to surround us, they will have to make a wider circuit;


6.3.30
3415
ὅσῳ δ’ ἂν μεῖζον χωρίον περιβάλλωνται , τοσούτῳ ἀνάγκη αὐτοὺς ἀσθενεστέρους γίγνεσθαι .
and the greater the circuit they have to make, the weaker they must necessarily make their line.


6.3.31
3416
καὶ ὑμεῖς μὲν οὕτω ποιεῖτε ·
That is your course to pursue.


6.3.31
3417
σὺ δέ , ὦ Ἀρτάοζε καὶ Ἀρταγέρσα , τὴν χιλιοστὺν ἑκάτερος τῶν σὺν ὑμῖν πεζῶν ἐπὶ τούτοις ἔχετε .
But do you, Artaozus and Artagerses, have each of you a regiment of your infantry behind the carriages.


6.3.32
3418
καὶ σύ , ὦ Φαρνοῦχε καὶ Ἀσιαδάτα , τὴν τῶν ἱππέων χιλιοστὺν ἧς ἑκάτερος ἄρχει ὑμῶν μὴ συγκατατάττετε εἰς τὴν φάλαγγα , ἀλλ’ ὄπισθεν τῶν ἁρμαμαξῶν ἐξοπλίσθητε καθ’ ὑμᾶς αὐτούς ·
And you, Pharnuchus and Asiadatas, keep each of you the regiment of cavalry under your command out of the main line and take your stand by yourselves behind the carriages,


6.3.32
3419
ἔπειτα πρὸς ἐμὲ ἥκετε σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἡγεμόσιν .
and then come to me with the rest of the officers.


6.3.32
3420
οὕτω δὲ δεῖ ὑμᾶς παρεσκευάσθαι ὡς πρώτους δεῆσον ἀγωνίζεσθαι .
You must be just as fully ready, though in the rear, as if you were to be the first to have to join battle.


6.3.33
3421
καὶ σὺ δὲ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν ἐπὶ ταῖς καμήλοις ἀνδρῶν , ὄπισθεν τῶν ἁρμαμαξῶν ἐκτάττου ·
And you, the commander of the men on camels, take your position also behind the women’s carriages


6.3.33
3422
ποίει δ’ ὅ τι ἄν σοι παραγγέλλῃ Ἀρταγέρσης .
and do whatever Artagerses commands you.


6.3.34
3423
ὑμεῖς δ’ οἱ τῶν ἁρμάτων ἡγεμόνες διακληρωσάμενοι , ὁ μὲν λαχὼν ὑμῶν πρὸ τῆς φάλαγγος τὰ μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ ἑκατὸν ἔχων ἅρματα καταστησάτω ·
And you officers of the chariot forces cast lots, and let the one to whose lot it falls bring up his hundred chariots in front of the main line;


6.3.34
3424
αἱ δ’ ἕτεραι ἑκατοστύες τῶν ἁρμάτων , ἡ μὲν κατὰ τὸ δεξιὸν πλευρὸν τῆς στρατιᾶς στοιχοῦσα ἑπέσθω τῇ φάλαγγι ἐπὶ κέρως , ἡ δὲ κατὰ τὸ εὐώνυμον .
of the other two hundred, one shall take its place in line upon the right flank of the army, the other on the left, and follow the phalanx each in single file.


6.3.34
3425
Κῦρος μὲν οὕτω διέταττεν .
Thus did Cyrus plan his order of battle.


6.3.35
3426
Ἀβραδάτας δὲ ὁ Σούσων βασιλεὺς εἶπεν ·
But Abradatas, the king of Susa, said:


6.3.35
3427
ἐγώ σοι , Κῦρε , ἐθελούσιος ὑφίσταμαι τὴν κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς ἀντίας φάλαγγος τάξιν ἔχειν , εἰ μή τί σοι ἄλλο δοκεῖ .
I will gladly volunteer to hold for you the post immediately in front of the enemy’s phalanx, Cyrus, unless you have some better plan.


6.3.36
3428
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἀγασθεὶς αὐτὸν καὶ δεξιωσάμενος ἐπήρετο τοὺς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅρμασι Πέρσας ·
And Cyrus admired his spirit and clasped his hand, and turning to the Persians in command of the other chariots he asked:


6.3.36
3429
ἦ καὶ ὑμεῖς , ἔφη , ταῦτα συγχωρεῖτε ;
Do you consent to this?


6.3.36
3430
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐκεῖνοι ἀπεκρίναντο ὅτι οὐ καλὸν εἴη ταῦτα ὑφίεσθαι , διεκλήρωσεν αὐτούς , καὶ ἔλαχεν ὁ Ἀβραδάτας ᾗπερ ὑφίστατο , καὶ ἐγένετο κατὰ τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους .
But they answered that it was inconsistent with their idea of honour to yield the place to him; accordingly, he had them cast lots; and Abradatas was assigned by lot to the place for which he had volunteered, and took his place over against the Egyptians.


6.3.37
3431
τότε μὲν δὴ ἀπιόντες καὶ ἐπιμεληθέντες ὧν προεῖπον ἐδειπνοποιοῦντο καὶ φυλακὰς καταστησάμενοι ἐκοιμήθησαν .
This done, they went away, and when they had attended to the details of all that I have mentioned, they went to dinner; and then they stationed their pickets and went to bed.


6.4.1
3432
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ πρῲ Κῦρος μὲν ἐθύετο , ὁ δ’ ἄλλος στρατὸς ἀριστήσας καὶ σπονδὰς ποιησάμενος ἐξωπλίζετο πολλοῖς μὲν καὶ καλοῖς χιτῶσι , πολλοῖς δὲ καὶ καλοῖς θώραξι καὶ κράνεσιν ·
Early on the following day Cyrus  was sacrificing, and the rest of the army, after breakfasting and pouring libations, proceeded to array themselves with many fine tunics and corselets and helms.


6.4.1
3433
ὥπλιζον δὲ καὶ ἵππους προμετωπιδίοις καὶ προστερνιδίοις ·
And they armed their horses also with frontlets and breastplates;


6.4.1
3434
καὶ τοὺς μὲν μονίππους παραμηριδίοις , τοὺς δ’ ὑπὸ τοῖς ἅρμασιν ὄντας παραπλευριδίοις ·
the saddle-horses also they armed with thigh-pieces and the chariot teams with side-armour.


6.4.1
3435
ὥστε ἤστραπτε μὲν χαλκῷ , ἤνθει δὲ φοινικίσι πᾶσα ἡ στρατιά .
And so the whole army flashed with bronze and was resplendent in purple.


6.4.2
3436
καὶ τῷ Ἀβραδάτᾳ δὲ τὸ τετράρρυμον ἅρμα καὶ ἵππων ὀκτὼ παγκάλως ἐκεκόσμητο .
And Abradatas’s chariot with its four poles and eight horses was adorned most handsomely;


6.4.2
3437
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἔμελλε τὸν λινοῦν θώρακα , ὃς ἐπιχώριος ἦν αὐτοῖς , ἐνδύεσθαι , προσφέρει αὐτῷ ἡ Πάνθεια χρυσοῦν καὶ χρυσοῦν κράνος καὶ περιβραχιόνια καὶ ψέλια πλατέα περὶ τοὺς καρποὺς τῶν χειρῶν καὶ χιτῶνα πορφυροῦν ποδήρη στολιδωτὸν τὰ κάτω καὶ λόφον ὑακινθινοβαφῆ .
and when he came to put on his linen corselet, such as they used in his country, Panthea brought him one of gold, also a helmet, arm-pieces, broad bracelets for his wrists — all of gold — and a purple tunic that hung down in folds to his feet, and a helmet-plume of hyacinth dye.


6.4.2
3438
ταῦτα δ’ ἐποιήσατο λάθρᾳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἐκμετρησαμένη τὰ ἐκείνου ὅπλα .
All these she had had made without her husband’s knowledge, taking the measure for them from his armour.


6.4.3
3439
ὁ δὲ ἰδὼν ἐθαύμασέ τε καὶ ἐπήρετο τὴν Πάνθειαν ·
And when he saw them he was astonished and turning to Panthea, he asked:


6.4.3
3440
οὐ δήπου , ὦ γύναι , συγκόψασα τὸν σαυτῆς κόσμον τὰ ὅπλα μοι ἐποιήσω ;
Tell me, wife, you did not break your own jewels to pieces, did you, to have this armour made for me?


6.4.3
3441
μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ἡ Πάνθεια , οὔκουν τόν γε πλείστου ἄξιον ·
No, by Zeus, answered Panthea, at any rate, not my most precious jewel;


6.4.3
3442
σὺ γὰρ ἔμοιγε , ἢν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις φανῇς οἷόσπερ ἐμοὶ δοκεῖς εἶναι , μέγιστος κόσμος ἔσῃ .
for you, if you appear to others as you seem to me, shall be my noblest jewel.


6.4.3
3443
ταῦτα δὲ λέγουσα ἅμα ἐνέδυε τὰ ὅπλα , καὶ λανθάνειν μὲν ἐπειρᾶτο , ἐλείβετο δὲ αὐτῇ τὰ δάκρυα κατὰ τῶν παρειῶν .
With these words, she began to put the armour on him, and though she tried to conceal them, the tears stole down her cheeks.


6.4.4
3444
ἐπεὶ δὲ καὶ πρόσθεν ὢν ἀξιοθέατος ὁ Ἀβραδάτας ὡπλίσθη τοῖς ὅπλοις τούτοις , ἐφάνη μὲν κάλλιστος καὶ ἐλευθεριώτατος , ἅτε καὶ τῆς φύσεως ὑπαρχούσης ·
And when Abradatas was armed in his panoply he looked most handsome and noble, for he had been favoured by nature and, even unadorned, was well worth looking at;


6.4.4
3445
λαβὼν δὲ παρὰ τοῦ ὑφηνιόχου τὰς ἡνίας παρεσκευάζετο ὡς ἀναβησόμενος ἤδη ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα .
and taking the reins from his groom he was now making ready to mount his chariot.


6.4.5
3446
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ ἡ Πάνθεια ἀποχωρῆσαι κελεύσασα τοὺς παρόντας πάντας ἔλεξεν ·
But at this moment Panthea bade all who stood near to retire and then she said:


6.4.5
3447
ἀλλ’ ὅτι μέν , ὦ Ἀβραδάτα , εἴ τις καὶ ἄλλη πώποτε γυνὴ τὸν ἑαυτῆς ἄνδρα μεῖζον τῆς αὑτῆς ψυχῆς ἐτίμησεν , οἶμαί σε γιγνώσκειν ὅτι καὶ ἐγὼ μία τούτων εἰμί .
Abradatas, if ever any woman loved her husband more than her own life, I think you know that I, too, am such a one.


6.4.5
3448
τί οὖν ἐμὲ δεῖ καθ’ ἓν ἕκαστον λέγειν ;
Why, then, should I tell of these things one by one?


6.4.5
3449
τὰ γὰρ ἔργα οἶμαί σοι πιθανώτερα παρεσχῆσθαι τῶν νῦν λεχθέντων λόγων .
For I think that my conduct has given you better proof of it than any words I now might say.


6.4.6
3450
ὅμως δὲ οὕτως ἔχουσα πρὸς σὲ ὥσπερ σὺ οἶσθα , ἐπομνύω σοι τὴν ἐμὴν καὶ σὴν φιλίαν ἦ μὴν ἐγὼ βούλεσθαι ἂν μετὰ σοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἀγαθοῦ γενομένου κοινῇ γῆν ἐπιέσασθαι μᾶλλον ἢ ζῆν μετ’ αἰσχυνομένου αἰσχυνομένη ·
Still, with the affection that you know I have for you, I swear to you by my love for you and yours for me that, of a truth, I would far rather go down into the earth with you, if you approve yourself a gallant soldier, than live disgraced with one disgraced:


6.4.6
3451
οὕτως ἐγὼ καὶ σὲ τῶν καλλίστων καὶ ἐμαυτὴν ἠξίωκα .
so worthy of the noblest lot have I deemed both you and myself.


6.4.7
3452
καὶ Κύρῳ δὲ μεγάλην τινὰ δοκῶ ἡμᾶς χάριν ὀφείλειν , ὅτι με αἰχμάλωτον γενομένην καὶ ἐξαιρεθεῖσαν αὑτῷ οὔτε ὡς δούλην ἠξίωσε κεκτῆσθαι οὔτε ὡς ἐλευθέραν ἐν ἀτίμῳ ὀνόματι , διεφύλαξε δὲ σοὶ ὥσπερ ἀδελφοῦ γυναῖκα λαβών .
And to Cyrus  I think we owe a very large debt of gratitude, because, when I was his prisoner and allotted to him, he did not choose to keep me either as his slave or as a freewoman under a dishonourable name, but took me and kept me for you as one would a brother’s wife.


6.4.8
3453
πρὸς δὲ καὶ ὅτε Ἀράσπας ἀπέστη αὐτοῦ ὁ ἐμὲ φυλάττων , ὑπεσχόμην αὐτῷ , εἴ με ἐάσειε πρὸς σὲ πέμψαι , ἥξειν αὐτῷ σὲ πολὺ Ἀράσπου ἄνδρα καὶ πιστότερον καὶ ἀμείνονα .
And then, too, when Araspas, who had been charged with my keeping, deserted him, I promised him that if he would let me send to you, a far better and truer friend than Araspas would come to him, in you.


6.4.9
3454
ἡ μὲν ταῦτα εἶπεν ·
Thus she spoke;


6.4.9
3455
ὁ δὲ Ἀβραδάτας ἀγασθεὶς τοῖς λόγοις καὶ θιγὼν αὐτῆς τῆς κεφαλῆς ἀναβλέψας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐπηύξατο ·
and Abradatas, touched by her words, laid his hand upon her head and lifting up his eyes toward heaven prayed, saying:


6.4.9
3456
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Ζεῦ μέγιστε , δός μοι φανῆναι ἀξίῳ μὲν Πανθείας ἀνδρί , ἀξίῳ δὲ Κύρου φίλῳ τοῦ ἡμᾶς τιμήσαντος .
Grant me, I pray, almighty Zeus, that I may show myself a husband worthy of Panthea and a friend worthy of Cyrus, who has shown us honour.


6.4.9
3457
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν κατὰ τὰς θύρας τοῦ ἁρματείου δίφρου ἀνέβαινεν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα .
As he said this, he mounted his car by the doors in the chariot-box.


6.4.10
3458
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀναβάντος αὐτοῦ κατέκλεισε τὸν δίφρον ὁ ὑφηνίοχος , οὐκ ἔχουσα ἡ Πάνθεια πῶς ἂν ἔτι ἄλλως ἀσπάσαιτο αὐτόν , κατεφίλησε τὸν δίφρον ·
And when he had entered and the groom closed the box, Panthea, not knowing how else she could now kiss him good-bye, touched her lips to the chariot-box.


6.4.10
3459
καὶ τῷ μὲν προῄει ἤδη τὸ ἅρμα , ἡ δὲ λαθοῦσα αὐτὸν συνεφείπετο , ἕως ἐπιστραφεὶς καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὴν Ἀβραδάτας εἶπε ·
And then at once his chariot rolled away, but she followed after, unknown to him, until Abradatas turned round and saw her and said:


6.4.11
3460
θάρρει , Πάνθεια , καὶ χαῖρε καὶ ἄπιθι ἤδη .
Have a brave heart, Panthea, and farewell! And now go back.


6.4.11
3461
ἐκ τούτου δὴ οἱ εὐνοῦχοι καὶ αἱ θεράπαιναι λαβοῦσαι ἀπῆγον αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν ἁρμάμαξαν καὶ κατακλίναντες κατεκάλυψαν τῇ σκηνῇ .
Then the eunuchs and maid-servants took her and conducted her to her carriage, where they bade her recline, and hid her completely from view with the hood of the carriage.


6.4.11
3462
οἱ δὲ ἄνθρωποι , καλοῦ ὄντος τοῦ θεάματος τοῦ τε Ἀβραδάτου καὶ τοῦ ἅρματος , οὐ πρόσθεν ἐδύναντο θεάσασθαι αὐτὸν πρὶν ἡ Πάνθεια ἀπῆλθεν .
And the people, beautiful as was the sight of Abradatas and his chariot, had no eyes for him, until Panthea was gone.


6.4.12
3463
ὡς δ’ ἐκεκαλλιερήκει μὲν ὁ Κῦρος , ἡ δὲ στρατιὰ παρετέτακτο αὐτῷ ὥσπερ παρήγγειλε , κατέχων σκοπὰς ἄλλας πρὸ ἄλλων συνεκάλεσε τοὺς ἡγεμόνας καὶ ἔλεξεν ὧδε .
Now when Cyrus  found the omens from his sacrifice favourable, and when his army was arranged as he had instructed, he had posts of observation occupied, one in advance of another, and then called his generals together and addressed them as follows:


6.4.13
3464
ἄνδρες φίλοι καὶ σύμμαχοι , τὰ μὲν ἱερὰ οἱ θεοὶ ἡμῖν φαίνουσιν οἷάπερ ὅτε τὴν πρόσθεν νίκην ἔδοσαν ·
Friends and allies, the gods have sent us omens from the sacrifice just like those we had when they gave the former victory into our hands.


6.4.13
3465
ὑμᾶς δ’ ἐγὼ βούλομαι ἀναμνῆσαι ὧν μοι δοκεῖτε μεμνημένοι πολὺ ἂν εὐθυμότεροι εἰς τὸν ἀγῶνα ἰέναι .
So I wish to remind you of some things which, if you will remember them, I think will make you go into battle with much stouter hearts.


6.4.14
3466
ἠσκήκατε μὲν γὰρ τὰ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον πολὺ μᾶλλον τῶν πολεμίων , συντέτραφθε δὲ καὶ συντέταχθε ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ πολὺ πλείω ἤδη χρόνον ἢ οἱ πολέμιοι καὶ συννενικήκατε μετ’ ἀλλήλων ·
On the one hand, you have received much better training in the arts of war than the enemy, you have lived together and drilled together in the same place for a much longer time now than they, and together you have won a victory;


6.4.14
3467
τῶν δὲ πολεμίων οἱ πολλοὶ συνήττηνται μεθ’ αὑτῶν , οἱ δὲ ἀμάχητοι ἑκατέρων οἱ μὲν τῶν πολεμίων ἴσασιν ὅτι προδότας τοὺς παραστάτας ἔχουσιν , ὑμεῖς δὲ οἱ μεθ’ ἡμῶν ἴστε ὅτι μετὰ θελόντων τοῖς συμμάχοις ἀρήγειν μαχεῖσθε .
most of the enemy, on the other hand, have together suffered defeat. Some on both sides, however, were not in the battle; among these our enemies know that they have traitors by their sides, while you who are with us know that you are doing battle in company with those who are glad to stand by their comrades.


6.4.15
3468
εἰκὸς δὲ τοὺς μὲν πιστεύοντας ἀλλήλοις ὁμόνως μάχεσθαι μένοντας , τοὺς δὲ ἀπιστοῦντας ἀναγκαῖον βουλεύεσθαι πῶς ἂν ἕκαστοι τάχιστα ἐκποδὼν γένοιντο .
And it is a matter of course that those who trust one another will stand their ground and fight with one heart and mind, and that those who distrust each other will necessarily be scheming, each how he may get out of the way as quickly as possible.


6.4.16
3469
ἴωμεν δή , ὦ ἄνδρες , ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους , ἅρματα μὲν ἔχοντες ὡπλισμένα πρὸς ἄοπλα τὰ τῶν πολεμίων , ὡς δ’ αὔτως καὶ ἱππέας καὶ ἵππους ὡπλισμένους πρὸς ἀόπλους , ὡς ἐκ χειρὸς μάχεσθαι .
Therefore, my men, let us go against the enemy, to fight in a hand-to-hand encounter, with our chariots armed, against theirs unarmed; and our horses and riders in like manner armed, against theirs unarmed.


6.4.17
3470
πεζοῖς δὲ τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις οἷς καὶ πρόσθεν μαχεῖσθε , Αἰγύπτιοι δὲ ὁμοίως μὲν ὡπλισμένοι εἰσίν , ὁμοίως δὲ τεταγμένοι ·
The infantry that you will fight against, you have fought before — all but the Egyptians; and they are armed and drawn up alike badly;


6.4.17
3471
τάς τε γὰρ ἀσπίδας μείζους ἔχουσιν ἢ ὡς ποιεῖν τι καὶ ὁρᾶν , τεταγμένοι τε εἰς ἑκατὸν δῆλον ὅτι κωλύσουσιν ἀλλήλους μάχεσθαι πλὴν πάνυ ὀλίγων .
for with those big shields which they have they cannot do anything or see anything; and drawn up a hundred deep, it is clear that they will hinder one another from fighting — all except a few.


6.4.18
3472
εἰ δὲ ὠθοῦντες ἐξώσειν πιστεύουσιν , ἵπποις αὐτοὺς πρῶτον δεήσει ἀντέχειν καὶ σιδήρῳ ὑφ’ ἵππων ἰσχυριζομένῳ ·
But if they believe that by rushing they will rush us off the field, they will first have to sustain the charge of horses and of steel driven upon them by the force of horses;


6.4.18
3473
ἢν δέ τις αὐτῶν καὶ ὑπομείνῃ , πῶς ἅμα δυνήσεται ἱππομαχεῖν τε καὶ φαλαγγομαχεῖν καὶ πυργομαχεῖν ;
and if any of them should hold his ground, how will he be able to fight at the same time against cavalry and phalanxes and towers?


6.4.18
3474
καὶ γὰρ οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πύργων ἡμῖν μὲν ἐπαρήξουσι , τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους παίοντες ἀμηχανεῖν ἀντὶ τοῦ μάχεσθαι ποιήσουσιν .
And that he will have to do, for those upon our towers will come to our aid and raining their missiles upon the enemy will drive them to distraction rather than to fighting.


6.4.19
3475
εἰ δέ τινος ἔτι ἐνδεῖσθαι δοκεῖτε , πρὸς ἐμὲ λέγετε ·
Still, if you think we need anything more, tell me;


6.4.19
3476
σὺν γὰρ θεοῖς οὐδενὸς ἀπορήσομεν .
for with the help of the gods, we shall lack for nothing.


6.4.19
3477
καὶ εἰ μέν τις εἰπεῖν τι βούλεται , λεξάτω ·
So, if any one wishes to make any remarks, let him speak.


6.4.19
3478
εἰ δὲ μή , ἐλθόντες πρὸς τὰ ἱερὰ καὶ προσευξάμενοι οἷς ἐθύσαμεν θεοῖς ἴτε ἐπὶ τὰς τάξεις ·
If not, do you go to the place of sacrifice and pray to the gods to whom we have sacrificed and then go back to your posts.


6.4.20
3479
καὶ ἕκαστος ὑμῶν ὑπομιμνῃσκέτω τοὺς μεθ’ αὑτοῦ ἅπερ ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς , καὶ ἐπιδεικνύτω τις τοῖς ἀρχομένοις ἑαυτὸν ἄξιον ἀρχῆς , ἄφοβον δεικνὺς καὶ σχῆμα καὶ πρόσωπον καὶ λόγους .
And each one of you remind his own men of what I have called to your attention, and let each man prove to those whom he commands that he is himself worthy of command, by showing himself fearless in his bearing, in his countenance, and in his words.




7.1.1
3480
οἱ μὲν δὴ εὐξάμενοι τοῖς θεοῖς ἀπῇσαν πρὸς τὰς τάξεις ·
So when they had prayed to the gods they went back to their posts;


7.1.1
3481
τῷ δὲ Κύρῳ καὶ τοῖς ἀμφ’ αὐτὸν προσήνεγκαν οἱ θεράποντες ἐμφαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν ἔτι οὖσιν ἀμφὶ τὰ ἱερά .
and while Cyrus and his staff were still engaged with the sacrifice, their attendants brought them meat and drink.


7.1.1
3482
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὥσπερ εἶχεν ἑστηκὼς ἀπαρξάμενος ἠρίστα καὶ μετεδίδου ἀεὶ τῷ μάλιστα δεομένῳ ·
And Cyrus remained standing just as he was and first offered to the gods a part and then began his breakfast, and kept giving a share of it also from time to time to any one who most needed it.


7.1.1
3483
καὶ σπείσας καὶ εὐξάμενος ἔπιε , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι δὲ οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν οὕτως ἐποίουν .
And when he had poured a libation and prayed, he drank; and the rest, his staff-officers, followed his example.


7.1.1
3484
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα αἰτησάμενος Δία πατρῷον ἡγεμόνα εἶναι καὶ σύμμαχον ἀνέβαινεν ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον καὶ τοὺς ἀμφ’ αὑτὸν ἐκέλευεν .
After that, he prayed to ancestral Zeus to be their guide and helper and then mounted his horse and bade his staff do the same.


7.1.2
3485
ὡπλισμένοι δὲ πάντες ἦσαν οἱ περὶ τὸν Κῦρον τοῖς αὐτοῖς Κύρῳ ὅπλοις , χιτῶσι φοινικοῖς , θώραξι χαλκοῖς , κράνεσι χαλκοῖς , λόφοις λευκοῖς , μαχαίραις , παλτῷ κρανεΐνῳ ἑνὶ ἕκαστος ·
Now all Cyrus’s staff were panoplied in armour the same as his: purple tunics, bronze corselets, bronze helmets with white plumes, and sabres; and each had a single spear with a shaft of cornel wood.


7.1.2
3486
οἱ δὲ ἵπποι προμετωπιδίοις καὶ προστερνιδίοις καὶ παραμηριδίοις χαλκοῖς ·
Their horses were armed with frontlets, breast-pieces, and thigh-pieces of bronze;


7.1.2
3487
τὰ δ’ αὐτὰ ταῦτα παραμηρίδια ἦν καὶ τῷ ἀνδρί ·
these served to protect the thighs of the rider as well.


7.1.2
3488
τοσοῦτον μόνον διέφερον τὰ Κύρου ὅπλα ὅτι τὰ μὲν ἄλλα ἐκέχριτο τῷ χρυσοειδεῖ χρώματι , τὰ δὲ Κύρου ὅπλα ὥσπερ κάτοπτρον ἐξέλαμπεν .
The arms of Cyrus differed from those of the rest in this only, that while the rest were overlaid with the ordinary gold colour, Cyrus’s arms flashed like a mirror.


7.1.3
3489
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀνέβη καὶ ἔστη ἀποβλέπων ᾗπερ ἔμελλε πορεύεσθαι , βροντὴ δεξιὰ ἐφθέγξατο ·
Then, when he had mounted his horse and sat looking off in the direction he was to take, there was a clap of thunder on the right.


7.1.3
3490
ὁ δ’ εἶπεν ·
Almighty Zeus, we will follow thee,


7.1.3
3491
ἑψόμεθά σοι , ὦ Ζεῦ μέγιστε .
he cried,


7.1.3
3492
καὶ ὡρμᾶτο ἐν μὲν δεξιᾷ ἔχων Χρυσάνταν τὸν ἵππαρχον καὶ τοὺς ἱππέας , ἐν ἀριστερᾷ δὲ Ἀρσάμαν καὶ τοὺς πεζούς .
and started, with Chrysantas, the master of the horse, and the cavalry on the right, and on the left Arsamas and the infantry.


7.1.4
3493
παρηγγύησε δὲ παρορᾶν πρὸς τὸ σημεῖον καὶ ἐν ἴσῳ ἕπεσθαι ·
And he gave orders to keep an eye upon his ensign and advance in even step.


7.1.4
3494
ἦν δὲ αὐτῷ τὸ σημεῖον ἀετὸς χρυσοῦς ἐπὶ δόρατος μακροῦ ἀνατεταμένος .
Now his ensign was a golden eagle with outspread wings mounted upon a long shaft.


7.1.4
3495
καὶ νῦν δ’ ἔτι τοῦτο τὸ σημεῖον τῷ Περσῶν βασιλεῖ διαμένει .
And this continues even unto this day as the ensign of the Persian king.


7.1.4
3496
πρὶν δὲ ὁρᾶν τοὺς πολεμίους εἰς τρὶς ἀνέπαυσε τὸ στράτευμα .
Before they came in sight of the enemy, he halted the army as many as three times.


7.1.5
3497
ἐπεὶ δὲ προεληλύθεσαν ὡς εἴκοσι σταδίους , ἤρχοντο ἤδη τὸ τῶν πολεμίων στράτευμα ἀντιπροσιὸν καθορᾶν .
But when they had advanced about twenty stadia, then they began to get sight of the enemy’s army coming on to meet them.


7.1.5
3498
ὡς δ’ ἐν τῷ καταφανεῖ πάντες ἀλλήλοις ἐγένοντο καὶ ἔγνωσαν οἱ πολέμιοι πολὺ ἑκατέρωθεν ὑπερφαλαγγοῦντες , στήσαντες τὴν αὑτῶν φάλαγγα ( οὐ γὰρ ἔστιν ἄλλως κυκλοῦσθαι ) , ἐπέκαμπτον εἰς κύκλωσιν , ὥσπερ γάμμα ἑκατέρωθεν τὴν ἑαυτῶν τάξιν ποιήσαντες , ὡς πάντοθεν ἅμα μάχοιντο .
And when they were all in sight of one another and the enemy became aware that they greatly outflanked the Persians on both sides, Croesus halted his centre — for otherwise it is impossible to execute a surrounding manoeuvre — and began to wheel the wings around to encompass the Persians, thus making his own lines on either flank in form like a gamma, so as to close in and attack on all three sides at once.


7.1.6
3499
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὁρῶν ταῦτα οὐδέν τι μᾶλλον ἀφίστατο , ἀλλ’ ὡσαύτως ἡγεῖτο .
But Cyrus, although he saw this movement, did not any the more recede but led on just as before.


7.1.6
3500
κατανοῶν δὲ ὡς πρόσω τὸν καμπτῆρα ἑκατέρωθεν ἐποιήσαντο περὶ ὃν κάμπτοντες ἀνέτεινον τὰ κέρατα , ἐννοεῖς , ἔφη , ὦ Χρυσάντα , ἔνθα τὴν ἐπικαμπὴν ποιοῦνται ;
Do you observe, Chrysantas, where the wings are drawing off to form their angle with the centre?


7.1.6
3501
πάνυ γε , ἔφη ὁ Χρυσάντας , καὶ θαυμάζω γε ·
he asked, as he noticed at what a distance from the centre column on both sides they made their turning point, and how far they were pushing forward their wings in executing their flanking movement.


7.1.6
3502
πολὺ γάρ μοι δοκοῦσιν ἀποσπᾶν τὰ κέρατα ἀπὸ τῆς ἑαυτῶν φάλαγγος .
Indeed I do, answered Chrysantas, and I am surprised, too; for it strikes me that they are drawing their wings a long way off from their centre.


7.1.6
3503
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καὶ ἀπό γε τῆς ἡμετέρας .
Aye, by Zeus, said Cyrus, and from ours, too.


7.1.7
3504
τί δὴ τοῦτο ;
What, pray, is the reason for that?


7.1.7
3505
δῆλον ὅτι φοβούμενοι μὴ ἢν ἐγγὺς ἡμῶν γένωνται τὰ κέρατα τῆς φάλαγγος ἔτι πρόσω οὔσης , ἐπιθώμεθα αὐτοῖς .
Evidently because they are afraid their wings will get too close to us while their centre is still far away and that we shall thus close with them.


7.1.7
3506
ἔπειτ’ , ἔφη ὁ Χρυσάντας , πῶς δυνήσονται ὠφελεῖν οἱ ἕτεροι τοὺς ἑτέρους οὕτω πολὺ ἀπέχοντες ἀλλήλων ;
Then said Chrysantas, how will the one division be able to support the other, when they are so far apart?


7.1.7
3507
ἀλλὰ δῆλον , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὅτι ἡνίκα ἂν γένωνται τὰ κέρατα ἀναβαίνοντα κατ’ ἀντιπέρας τῶν πλαγίων τοῦ ἡμετέρου στρατεύματος , στραφέντες ὡς εἰς φάλαγγα ἅμα πάντοθεν ἡμῖν προσίασι μαχούμενοι .
Well, answered Cyrus, it is obvious that just as soon as the wings now advancing in column get directly opposite the flanks of our army, they will face about so as to form front and then advance upon us from all three sides simultaneously; for it is their intention to close in on us on all sides at once.


7.1.8
3508
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Χρυσάντας , εὖ σοι δοκοῦσι βουλεύεσθαι ;
Well said Chrysantas, do you then think their plan a good one?


7.1.8
3509
πρός γε ἃ ὁρῶσι ·
Yes; to meet what they see.


7.1.8
3510
πρὸς δὲ ἃ οὐχ ὁρῶσιν ἔτι κάκιον ἢ εἰ κατὰ κέρας προσῇσαν .
But in the face of what they do not see, it is even worse than if they were coming on in column.


7.1.8
3511
ἀλλὰ σὺ μέν , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρσάμα , ἡγοῦ τῷ πεζῷ ἠρέμα ὥσπερ ἐμὲ ὁρᾷς ·
But do you, Arsamas, said he, lead on your infantry slowly, just as you see me moving;


7.1.8
3512
καὶ σύ , ὦ Χρυσάντα , ἐν ἴσῳ τούτῳ τὸ ἱππικὸν ἔχων συμπαρέπου .
and you, Chrysantas, follow along with the cavalry in an even line with him;


7.1.8
3513
ἐγὼ δὲ ἄπειμι ἐκεῖσε ὅθεν μοι δοκεῖ καιρὸς εἶναι ἄρχεσθαι τῆς μάχης ·
meanwhile I shall go to the point where it seems to me most advantageous to open the battle;


7.1.8
3514
ἅμα δὲ παριὼν ἐπισκέψομαι ἕκαστα πῶς ἡμῖν ἔχει .
and at the same time, as I pass along, I will take observations and see how everything is with our side.


7.1.9
3515
ἐπειδὰν δ’ ἐκεῖ γένωμαι , ὅταν ἤδη ὁμοῦ προσιόντες ἀλλήλοις γιγνώμεθα , παιᾶνα ἐξάρξω , ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐπείγεσθε .
But when I reach the spot, and as soon as in our advance we are near enough together, I will begin the paean, and then do you press on.


7.1.9
3516
ἡνίκα δ’ ἂν ἡμεῖς ἐγχειρῶμεν τοῖς πολεμίοις , αἰσθήσεσθε μέν , οὐ γὰρ οἶμαι ὀλίγος θόρυβος ἔσται , ὁρμήσεται δὲ τηνικαῦτα Ἀβραδάτας ἤδη σὺν τοῖς ἅρμασιν εἰς τοὺς ἐναντίους ·
And the moment we come to close quarters with the enemy, you will perceive it, for there will be no little noise, I presume; and at the same moment Abradatas will charge with his chariots upon the enemy’s lines —


7.1.9
3517
οὕτω γὰρ αὐτῷ εἰρήσεται ·
for so he will be instructed to do —


7.1.9
3518
ὑμᾶς δὲ χρὴ ἕπεσθαι ἐχομένους ὅτι μάλιστα τῶν ἁρμάτων .
and you must follow him, keeping as close as possible behind the chariots.


7.1.9
3519
οὕτω γὰρ μάλιστα τοῖς πολεμίοις τεταραγμένοις ἐπιπεσούμεθα .
For in this way we shall best throw the enemy into confusion and then fall upon them.


7.1.9
3520
παρέσομαι δὲ κ- ἐγὼ ᾗ ἂν δύνωμαι τάχιστα διώκων τοὺς ἄνδρας , ἢν οἱ θεοὶ θέλωσι .
And I also shall be there as soon as I can, please God, to join in the pursuit.


7.1.10
3521
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν καὶ ξύνθημα παρεγγυήσας Ζεὺς σωτὴρ καὶ ἡγεμὼν ἐπορεύετο .
When he had spoken these words, he passed along the lines the watchword, Zeus our Saviour and Guide, and rode on.


7.1.10
3522
μεταξὺ δὲ τῶν ἁρμάτων καὶ τῶν θωρακοφόρων διαπορευόμενος ὁπότε προσβλέψειέ τινας τῶν ἐν ταῖς τάξεσι , τότε μὲν εἶπεν ἄν ·
And as he passed between the lines of chariots and heavy-armed infantry and bestowed a glance upon some of those in the lines, he would say:


7.1.10
3523
ὦ ἄνδρες , ὡς ἡδὺ ὑμῶν τὰ πρόσωπα θεάσασθαι .
What a pleasure it is, my friends, to look into your faces.


7.1.10
3524
τοτὲ δ’ αὖ ἐν ἄλλοις ἂν ἔλεξεν ·
And then again in the presence of others he would say:


7.1.10
3525
ἆρα ἐννοεῖτε , ἄνδρες , ὅτι ὁ νῦν ἀγών ἐστιν οὐ μόνον περὶ τῆς τήμερον νίκης , ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ τῆς πρόσθεν ἣν νενικήκατε καὶ περὶ πάσης εὐδαιμονίας ;
I trust you remember, men, that in the present battle not only is to-day’s victory at stake, but also the first victory you won and all our future success.


7.1.11
3526
ἐν ἄλλοις δ’ ἂν παριὼν εἶπεν ·
Before still others, as he passed along, he would remark:


7.1.11
3527
ὦ ἄνδρες , τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε οὐδέν ποτε ἔτι θεοὺς αἰτιατέον ἔσται ·
For all time to come, my men, we shall never have any more fault to find with the gods;


7.1.11
3528
παραδεδώκασι γὰρ ἡμῖν πολλά τε καὶ ἀγαθὰ κτήσασθαι .
for they have given us the opportunity of winning many blessings.


7.1.12
3529
ἀλλ’ ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ γενώμεθα .
So let us prove ourselves valiant men.


7.1.12
3530
κατ’ ἄλλους δ’ αὖ τοιάδε ·
Passing still others he said:


7.1.12
3531
ὦ ἄνδρες , εἰς τίνα ποτ’ ἂν καλλίονα ἔρανον ἀλλήλους παρακαλέσαιμεν ἢ εἰς τόνδε ;
To what fairer common feast could we ever invite each other, my men, than to this one?


7.1.12
3532
νῦν γὰρ ἔξεστιν ἀγαθοῖς ἀνδράσι γενομένοις πολλὰ κ- ἀγαθὰ ἀλλήλοις εἰσενεγκεῖν .
For now by showing ourselves brave men we may each contribute many good things for our mutual benefit.


7.1.13
3533
κατ’ ἄλλους δ’ αὖ ·
Passing others he would say:


7.1.13
3534
ἐπίστασθε μέν , οἶμαι , ὦ ἄνδρες , ὅτι νῦν ἆθλα πρόκειται τοῖς νικῶσι μὲν διώκειν , παίειν , κατακαίνειν , ἀγαθὰ ἔχειν , καλὰ ἀκούειν , ἐλευθέροις εἶναι , ἄρχειν ·
I suppose that you understand, men, that pursuing, dealing blows and death, plunder, fame, freedom, power — all these are now held up as prizes for the victors;


7.1.13
3535
τοῖς δὲ κακοῖς δῆλον ὅτι τ- ἐναντία τούτων .
the cowardly, of course, have the reverse of all this.


7.1.13
3536
ὅστις οὖν αὑτὸν φιλεῖ , μετ’ ἐμοῦ μαχέσθω ·
Whoever, therefore, cares for himself, let him fight with me;


7.1.13
3537
ἐγὼ γὰρ κακὸν οὐδὲν οὐδ’ αἰσχρὸν ἑκὼν εἶναι προσήσομαι .
for I will never bring myself to do anything base or cowardly, if I can help it.


7.1.14
3538
ὁπότε δ’ αὖ γένοιτο κατά τινας τῶν πρόσθεν συμμαχεσαμένων , εἶπεν ἄν ·
But whenever he came past any of those who had fought under him before, he would say:


7.1.14
3539
πρὸς δὲ ὑμᾶς , ὦ ἄνδρες , τί δεῖ λέγειν ;
What need to say anything to you, my men?


7.1.14
3540
ἐπίστασθε γὰρ οἵαν τε οἱ ἀγαθοὶ ἐν ταῖς μάχαις ἡμέραν ἄγουσι καὶ οἵαν οἱ κακοί .
For you know how the brave celebrate a day in battle, and how cowards.


7.1.15
3541
ὡς δὲ παριὼν κατὰ Ἀβραδάταν ἐγένετο , ἔστη ·
And as he passed along and came to Abradatas, he stopped;


7.1.15
3542
καὶ ὁ Ἀβραδάτος παραδοὺς τῷ ὑφηνιόχῳ τὰς ἡνίας προσῆλθεν αὐτῷ ·
and Abradatas, handing the reins to his groom, came toward him,


7.1.15
3543
προσέδραμον δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι τῶν πλησίον τεταγμένων καὶ πεζῶν καὶ ἁρματηλατῶν .
and others also of those whose positions were near, both foot and chariot-drivers, ran up.


7.1.15
3544
ὁ δ’ αὖ Κῦρος ἐν τοῖς παραγεγενημένοις ἔλεξεν ·
And then to the company gathered about him Cyrus said:


7.1.15
3545
ὁ μὲν θεός , ὦ Ἀβραδάτα , ὥσπερ σὺ ἠξίους , συνηξίωσέ σε καὶ τοὺς σὺν σοὶ πρωτοστάτας εἶναι τῶν συμμάχων ·
Abradatas, God has approved your request that you and your men should take the front ranks among the allies.


7.1.15
3546
σὺ δὲ τοῦτο μέμνησο , ὅταν δέῃ σε ἤδη ἀγωνίζεσθαι , ὅτι Πέρσαι οἵ τε θεασόμενοι ὑμᾶς ἔσονται καὶ οἱ ἑψόμενοι ὑμῖν καὶ οὐκ ἐάσοντες ἐρήμους ὑμᾶς ἀγωνίζεσθαι .
So now remember this, when presently it becomes necessary for you to enter the conflict, that Persians will not only be your witnesses but will also follow you and will not let you go into the conflict unsupported.


7.1.16
3547
καὶ ὁ Ἀβραδάτας εἶπεν ·
Well, answered Abradatas,


7.1.16
3548
ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν καθ’ ἡμᾶς ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ , ὦ Κῦρε , καλῶς ἔχειν ·
to me at least our part of the army seems to be all right;


7.1.16
3549
ἀλλὰ τὰ πλάγια λυπεῖ με , ὅτι τὰ μὲν τῶν πολεμίων κέρατα ἰσχυρὰ ὁρῶ ἀνατεινόμενα καὶ ἅρμασι καὶ παντοδαπῇ στρατιᾷ ·
but I am anxious for the flanks; for I see the enemy’s wings stretching out strong with chariots and troops of every description,


7.1.16
3550
ἡμέτερον δ’ οὐδὲν ἄλλο αὐτοῖς ἀντιτέτακται ἢ ἅρματα ·
while in the centre there is nothing opposed to our side except chariots;


7.1.16
3551
ὥστ’ ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη , εἰ μὴ ἔλαχον τήνδε τὴν τάξιν , ᾐσχυνόμην ἂν ἐνθάδε ὤν ·
and so if I had not obtained this position by lot, I should, for my part, be ashamed of being here,


7.1.16
3552
οὕτω πολύ μοι δοκῶ ἐν ἀσφαλεστάτῳ εἶναι .
so much the safest position do I think I occupy.


7.1.17
3553
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Well said Cyrus,


7.1.17
3554
ἀλλ’ εἰ τὰ παρὰ σοὶ καλῶς ἔχει , θάρρει ὑπὲρ ἐκείνων ·
if your part is all right, never fear for the others;


7.1.17
3555
ἐγὼ γάρ σοι σὺν θεοῖς ἔρημα τῶν πολεμίων τὰ πλάγια ταῦτα ἀποδείξω .
for with the help of the gods I will clear those flanks of enemies for you.


7.1.17
3556
καὶ σὺ μὴ πρότερον ἔμβαλλε τοῖς ἐναντίοις , διαμαρτύρομαι , πρὶν ἂν φεύγοντας τούτους οὓς νῦν φοβῇ θεάσῃ ·
And do not you hurl yourself upon the opposing ranks, I adjure you, until you see in flight those whom you now fear.


7.1.17
3557
τοιαῦτα δ’ ἐμεγαληγόρει , μελλούσης τῆς μάχης γίγνεσθαι ·
Cyrus indulged in such boastful speech only on the eve of battle;


7.1.17
3558
ἄλλως δ’ οὐ μάλα μεγαλήγορος ἦν ·
at other times he was never boastful at all;


7.1.17
3559
ὅταν μέντοι ἴδῃς τούτους φεύγοντας , ἐμέ τε ἤδη παρεῖναι νόμιζε καὶ ὅρμα εἰς τοὺς ἄνδρας ·
but when you see them in flight, then be sure that I am already at hand, and charge upon those fellows;


7.1.17
3560
καὶ σὺ γὰρ τότε τοῖς μὲν ἐναντίοις κακίστοις ἂν χρήσαιο , τοῖς δὲ μετὰ σαυτοῦ ἀρίστοις .
for at that moment you will find your opponents most cowardly and your own men valiant.


7.1.18
3561
ἀλλ’ ἕως ἔτι σοι σχολή , ὦ Ἀβραδάτα , πάντως παρελάσας παρὰ τὰ σαυτοῦ ἅρματα παρακάλει τοὺς σὺν σοὶ εἰς τὴν ἐμβολήν , τῷ μὲν προσώπῳ παραθαρρύνων , ταῖς δ’ ἐλπίσιν ἐπικουφίζων .
But now, Abradatas, while you have time, by all means ride along your line of chariots and exhort your men to the charge, cheering them by your own looks and buoying them up with hopes.


7.1.18
3562
ὅπως δὲ κράτιστοι φανεῖσθε τῶν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἅρμασι , φιλονικίαν αὐτοῖς ἔμβαλλε ·
Furthermore, inspire them with a spirit of rivalry that you and your division may prove yourselves the best of the charioteers.


7.1.18
3563
καὶ γάρ , εὖ ἴσθι , ἢν τάδε εὖ γένηται , πάντες ἐροῦσι τὸ λοιπὸν μηδὲν εἶναι κερδαλεώτερον ἀρετῆς .
And that will be worth while; for be assured that if we are successful to-day, all men in future will say that nothing is more profitable than valour.


7.1.18
3564
ὁ μὲν δὴ Ἀβραδάτας ἀναβὰς παρήλαυνε καὶ ταῦτ’ ἐποίει .
Abradatas accordingly mounted and drove along and did as Cyrus had suggested.


7.1.19
3565
ὁ δ’ αὖ Κῦρος παριὼν ὡς ἐγένετο πρὸς τῷ εὐωνύμῳ , ἔνθα ὁ Ὑστάσπας τοὺς ἡμίσεις ἔχων ἦν τῶν Περσῶν ἱππέων , ὀνομάσας αὐτὸν εἶπεν ·
And as Cyrus passed along again, he came to the left wing, where Hystaspas was with half the Persian cavalry; he called him and said:


7.1.19
3566
ὦ Ὑστάσπα , νῦν ( ὁρᾷς ; ) ἔργον τῆς σῆς ταχυεργίας ·
Now, Hystaspas, you see some use for your speed;


7.1.19
3567
νῦν γὰρ ἢν φθάσωμεν τοὺς πολεμίους κατακανόντες , οὐδεὶς ἡμῶν ἀποθανεῖται .
for now, if we can kill the enemy before they kill us, not one of us will perish.


7.1.20
3568
καὶ ὁ Ὑστάσπας ἐπιγελάσας εἶπεν ·
Well said Hystaspas laughing,


7.1.20
3569
ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν τῶν ἐξ ἐναντίας ἡμῖν μελήσει , τοὺς δ’ ἐκ πλαγίου σὺ ἄλλοις πρόσταξον , ὅπως μηδ’ οὗτοι σχολάζωσι .
we will take care of those opposite us; assign those on the flank to another division, so that they also may have something to do.


7.1.20
3570
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Why said Cyrus,


7.1.20
3571
ἀλλ’ ἐπί γε τούτους ἐγὼ αὐτὸς παρέρχομαι ·
I am going on to them myself.


7.1.20
3572
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Ὑστάσπα , τόδε μέμνησο , ὅτῳ ἂν ἡμῶν ὁ θεὸς νίκην διδῷ , ἤν τί που μένῃ πολέμιον , πρὸς τὸ μαχόμενον ἀεὶ συμβάλλωμεν .
But remember this, Hystaspas, no matter to which of us God gives the victory first, if afterwards anything is left of any part of the enemy, let us all engage any force that still continues the fight.


7.1.21
3573
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν προῄει .
Thus he spoke and passed on.


7.1.21
3574
ἐπεὶ δὲ κατὰ τὸ πλευρὸν παριὼν ἐγένετο καὶ κατὰ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν ταύτῃ ἁρμάτων , πρὸς τοῦτον ἔλεξεν ·
And as he went along the flank, he came to the general in command of the chariots there and to him he said:


7.1.21
3575
ἐγὼ δὲ ἔρχομαι ὑμῖν ἐπικουρήσων ·
Yes, I am coming to help you;


7.1.21
3576
ἀλλ’ ὁπόταν αἴσθησθε ἡμᾶς ἐπιτιθεμένους κατ’ ἄκρον , τότε καὶ ὑμεῖς πειρᾶσθε ἅμα διὰ τῶν πολεμίων ἐλαύνειν ·
but when you see us charging on the extremity of the enemy’s wing, then do you try at the same time to break through their lines;


7.1.21
3577
πολὺ γὰρ ἐν ἀσφαλεστέρῳ ἔσεσθε ἔξω γενόμενοι ἢ ἔνδον ἀπολαμβανόμενοι .
for you will be in a much securer position if you get clear through than if you are enclosed within their line.


7.1.22
3578
ἐπεὶ δ’ αὖ παριὼν ἐγένετο ὄπισθεν τῶν ἁρμαμαξῶν , Ἀρταγέρσαν μὲν καὶ Φαρνοῦχον ἐκέλευσεν ἔχοντας τήν τε τῶν πεζῶν χιλιοστὺν καὶ τὴν τῶν ἱππέων μένειν αὐτοῦ .
And as he passed on again and came behind the women’s carriages, he ordered Artagerses and Pharnuchus with their respective regiments of infantry and cavalry to stay there.


7.1.22
3579
ἐπειδὰν δ’ , ἔφη , αἰσθάνησθε ἐμοῦ ἐπιτιθεμένου τοῖς κατὰ τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας , τότε καὶ ὑμεῖς τοῖς καθ’ ὑμᾶς ἐπιχειρεῖτε ·
But said he, when you see me charging against those opposite our right wing, do you also attack those opposite you.


7.1.22
3580
μαχεῖσθε δ’ , ἔφη , πρὸς κέρας , ᾗπερ ἀσθενέστατον στράτευμα γίγνεται , φάλαγγα δ’ ἔχοντες , ὥσπερ ἂν ἰσχυρότατοι εἴητε .
And you will be in a phalanx — the formation in which you would be strongest — and take the enemy on their flank, the position in which an army is weakest.


7.1.22
3581
καὶ εἰσὶ μέν , ὡς ὁρᾶτε , τῶν πολεμίων ἱππεῖς οἱ ἔσχατοι ·
And, as you see, their cavalry stands furthest out;


7.1.22
3582
πάντως δὲ πρόετε πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν τῶν καμήλων τάξιν , καὶ εὖ ἴστε ὅτι καὶ πρὶν μάχεσθαι γελοίους τοὺς πολεμίους θεάσεσθε .
so by all means send against them the brigade of camels, and be assured that even before the battle begins you will see the enemy in a ridiculous plight.


7.1.23
3583
ὁ μὲν δὴ Κῦρος ταῦτα διαπραξάμενος ἐπὶ τὸ δεξιὸν παρῄει ·
When Cyrus had completed his round of the troops, he passed on to the right wing.


7.1.23
3584
ὁ δὲ Κροῖσος νομίσας ἤδη ἐγγύτερον εἶναι τῶν πολεμίων τὴν φάλαγγα σὺν ᾗ αὐτὸς ἐπορεύετο ἢ τὰ ἀνατεινόμενα κέρατα , ἦρε τοῖς κέρασι σημεῖον μηκέτι ἄνω πορεύεσθαι , ἀλλ’ αὐτοῦ ἐν χώρᾳ στραφῆναι .
And Croesus, thinking that the centre, which he commanded in person, was already nearer to the enemy than the wings that were spreading out beyond, gave a signal to his wings not to go out any further but to halt and face about.


7.1.23
3585
ὡς δ’ ἔστησαν ἀντία πρὸς τὸ τοῦ Κύρου στράτευμα ὁρῶντες , ἐσήμηνεν αὐτοῖς πορεύεσθαι πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους .
And when they had halted, and stood facing Cyrus’s army, Croesus gave them the signal to advance against the foe.


7.1.24
3586
καὶ οὕτω δὴ προσῇσαν τρεῖς φάλαγγες ἐπὶ τὸ Κύρου στράτευμα , ἡ μὲν μία κατὰ πρόσωπον , τὼ δὲ δύο , ἡ μὲν κατὰ τὸ δεξιόν , ἡ δὲ κατὰ τὸ εὐώνυμον ·
And so the three phalanxes advanced upon the army of Cyrus, one from in front, the other two against his wings, one from the right, the other from the left;


7.1.24
3587
ὥστε πολὺν φόβον παρεῖναι πάσῃ τῇ Κύρου στρατιᾷ .
in consequence, great fear came upon all his army.


7.1.24
3588
ὥσπερ γὰρ μικρὸν πλινθίον ἐν μεγάλῳ τεθέν , οὕτω καὶ τὸ Κύρου στράτευμα πάντοθεν περιείχετο ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων καὶ ἱππεῦσι καὶ ὁπλίταις καὶ πελτοφόροις καὶ τοξόταις καὶ ἅρμασι πλὴν ἐξόπισθεν .
For just like a little tile set inside a large one, Cyrus’s army was encompassed by the enemy on every side, except the rear, with horsemen and hoplites, with targeteers and bowmen and chariots.


7.1.25
3589
ὅμως δὲ ὡς ὁ Κῦρος ἐπεὶ παρήγγειλεν , ἐστράφησαν πάντες ἀντιπρόσωποι τοῖς πολεμίοις ·
Still, when Cyrus gave the command, they all turned and faced the enemy.


7.1.25
3590
καὶ ἦν μὲν πολλὴ πανταχόθεν σιγὴ ὑπὸ τοῦ τὸ μέλλον ὀκνεῖν ·
And deep silence reigned on every hand because of their apprehension as to what was coming.


7.1.25
3591
ἡνίκα δὲ ἔδοξε τῷ Κύρῳ καιρὸς εἶναι , ἐξῆρχε παιᾶνα , συνεπήχησε δὲ πᾶς ὁ στρατός .
Then, when it seemed to Cyrus to be just the right time, he began the paean and all the army joined in the chant.


7.1.26
3592
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο τῷ Ἐνυαλίῳ τε ἅμα ἐπηλάλαξαν καὶ ἐξανίσταται ὁ Κῦρος , καὶ εὐθὺς μὲν μετὰ τῶν ἱππέων λαβὼν πλαγίους τοὺς πολεμίους ὁμόσε αὐτοῖς τὴν ταχίστην συνεμίγνυεν ·
After it was finished, together they raised the battle-shout to Enyalius, and in that instant Cyrus dashed forward; and at once he hurled his cavalry upon the enemy’s flank and in a moment he was engaged with them hand to hand.


7.1.26
3593
οἱ δὲ πεζοὶ αὐτῷ συντεταγμένοι ταχὺ ἐφείποντο , καὶ περιεπτύσσοντο ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν , ὥστε πολὺ ἐπλεονέκτει ·
With a rapid movement the infantry followed him in good order and began to envelop the enemy on this side and on that, so that he had them at a great disadvantage;


7.1.26
3594
φάλαγγι γὰρ κατὰ κέρας προσέβαλλεν ·
for he clashed with a phalanx against their flank;


7.1.26
3595
ὥστε ταχὺ ἰσχυρὰ φυγὴ ἐγένετο τοῖς πολεμίοις .
and as a result, the enemy soon were in headlong flight.


7.1.27
3596
ὡς δὲ ᾔσθετο Ἀρταγέρσης ἐν ἔργῳ ὄντα τὸν Κῦρον , ἐπιτίθεται καὶ αὐτὸς κατὰ τὰ εὐώνυμα , προεὶς τὰς καμήλους ὥσπερ Κῦρος ἐκέλευσεν .
As soon as Artagerses saw Cyrus in action, he delivered his attack on the enemy’s left, putting forward the camels, as Cyrus had directed.


7.1.27
3597
οἱ δὲ ἵπποι αὐτὰς ἐκ πάνυ πολλοῦ οὐκ ἐδέχοντο , ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν ἔκφρονες γιγνόμενοι ἔφευγον , οἱ δ’ ἐξήλλοντο , οἱ δ’ ἐνέπιπτον ἀλλήλοις .
But while the camels were still a great way off, the horses gave way before them; some took fright and ran away, others began to rear, while others plunged into one another;


7.1.27
3598
τοιαῦτα γὰρ πάσχουσιν ἵπποι ὑπὸ καμήλων .
for such is the usual effect that camels produce upon horses.


7.1.28
3599
ὁ δὲ Ἀρταγέρσης συντεταγμένους ἔχων τοὺς μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ ταραττομένοις ἐπέκειτο ·
And Artagerses, with his men in order, fell upon them in their confusion;


7.1.28
3600
καὶ τὰ ἅρματα δὲ κατὰ τὸ δεξιὸν καὶ τὸ εὐώνυμον ἅμα ἐνέβαλλε .
and at the same moment the chariots also charged on both the right and the left.


7.1.28
3601
καὶ πολλοὶ μὲν τὰ ἅρματα φεύγοντες ὑπὸ τῶν κατὰ κέρας ἑπομένων ἀπέθνῃσκον , πολλοὶ δὲ τούτους φεύγοντες ὑπὸ τῶν ἁρμάτων ἡλίσκοντο .
And many in their flight from the chariots were slain by the cavalry following up their attack upon the flank, and many also trying to escape from the cavalry were caught by the chariots.


7.1.29
3602
καὶ ὁ Ἀβραδάτας δὲ οὐκέτι ἔμελλεν , ἀλλ’ ἀναβοήσας ·
And Abradatas also lost no more time, but shouting,


7.1.29
3603
ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἕπεσθε , ἐνίει οὐδὲν φειδόμενος τῶν ἵππων , ἀλλ’ ἰσχυρῶς ἐξαιμάττων τῷ κέντρῳ ·
Now, friends, follow me, he swept forward, showing no mercy to his horses but drawing blood from them in streams with every stroke of the lash.


7.1.29
3604
συνεξώρμησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ἁρματηλάται .
And the rest of the chariot-drivers also rushed forward with him.


7.1.29
3605
καὶ τὰ μὲν ἅρματα ἔφευγεν αὐτοὺς εὐθύς , τὰ μὲν ἀναλαβόντα τοὺς παραβάτας , τὰ δὲ καὶ ἀπολιπόντα .
And the opposing chariots at once broke into flight before them; some, as they fled, took up their dismounted fighting men, others left theirs behind.


7.1.30
3606
ὁ δὲ Ἀβραδάτας ἀντικρὺ διᾴττων εἰς τὴν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων φάλαγγα ἐμβάλλει ·
But Abradatas plunged directly through them and hurled himself upon the Egyptian phalanx;


7.1.30
3607
συνεισέβαλον δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ ἐγγύτατα τεταγμένοι .
and the nearest of those who were arrayed with him also joined in the charge.


7.1.30
3608
πολλαχοῦ μὲν οὖν καὶ ἄλλοθι δῆλον ὡς οὐκ ἔστιν ἰσχυροτέρα φάλαγξ ἢ ὅταν ἐκ φίλων συμμάχων ἡθροισμένη ᾖ , καὶ ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἐδήλωσεν .
Now, it has been demonstrated on many other occasions that there is no stronger phalanx than that which is composed of comrades that are close friends;


7.1.30
3609
οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἑταῖροί τε αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁμοτράπεζοι συνεισέβαλλον ·
and it was shown to be true on this occasion.


7.1.30
3610
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ἡνίοχοι ὡς εἶδον ὑπομένοντας πολλῷ στίφει τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους , ἐξέκλιναν κατὰ τὰ φεύγοντα ἅρματα καὶ τούτοις ἐφείποντο .
For it was only the personal friends and mess-mates of Abradatas who pressed home the charge with him, while the rest of the charioteers, when they saw that the Egyptians with their dense throng withstood them, turned aside after the fleeing chariots and pursued them.


7.1.31
3611
οἱ δὲ ἀμφὶ Ἀβραδάταν ᾗ μὲν ἐνέβαλλον , ἅτε οὐ δυναμένων διαχάσασθαι τῶν Αἰγυπτίων διὰ τὸ μένειν τοὺς ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν αὐτῶν , τοὺς μὲν ὀρθοὺς τῇ ῥύμῃ τῇ τῶν ἵππων παίοντες ἀνέτρεπον , τοὺς δὲ πίπτοντας κατηλόων καὶ αὐτοὺς καὶ ὅπλα καὶ ἵπποις καὶ τροχοῖς .
But in the place where Abradatas and his companions charged, the Egyptians could not make an opening for them because the men on either side of them stood firm; consequently, those of the enemy who stood upright were struck in the furious charge of the horses and overthrown, and those who fell were crushed to pieces by the horses and the wheels, they and their arms;


7.1.31
3612
ὅτου δ’ ἐπιλάβοιτο τὰ δρέπανα , πάντα βίᾳ διεκόπτετο καὶ ὅπλα καὶ σώματα .
and whatever was caught in the scythes — everything, arms and men, was horribly mangled.


7.1.32
3613
ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀδιηγήτῳ τούτῳ ταράχῳ ὑπὸ τῶν παντοδαπῶν σωρευμάτων ἐξαλλομένων τῶν τροχῶν ἐκπίπτει ὁ Ἀβραδάτας καὶ ἄλλοι δὲ τῶν συνεισβαλόντων , καὶ οὗτοι μὲν ἐνταῦθα ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ γενόμενοι κατεκόπησαν καὶ ἀπέθανον ·
As in this indescribable confusion the wheels bounded over the heaps of every sort, Abradatas and others of those who went with him into the charge were thrown to the ground, and there, though they proved themselves men of valour, they were cut down and slain.


7.1.32
3614
οἱ δὲ Πέρσαι συνεπισπόμενοι , ᾗ μὲν ὁ Ἀβραδάτας ἐνέβαλε καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ , ταύτῃ ἐπεισπεσόντες τεταραγμένους ἐφόνευον , ᾗ δὲ ἀπαθεῖς ἐγένοντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ( πολλοὶ δ’ οὗτοι ἦσαν ) , ἐχώρουν ἐναντίοι τοῖς Πέρσαις .
Then the Persians, following up the attack at the point where Abradatas and his men had made their charge, made havoc of the enemy in their confusion; but where the Egyptians were still unharmed — and there were many such — they advanced to oppose the Persians.


7.1.33
3615
ἔνθα δὴ δεινὴ μάχη ἦν καὶ δοράτων καὶ ξυστῶν καὶ μαχαιρῶν ·
Here, then, was a dreadful conflict with spears and lances and swords.


7.1.33
3616
ἐπλεονέκτουν μέντοι οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι καὶ πλήθει καὶ τοῖς ὅπλοις .
The Egyptians, however, had the advantage both in numbers and in weapons;


7.1.33
3617
τά τε γὰρ δόρατα ἰσχυρὰ καὶ μακρὰ ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἔχουσιν , αἵ τε ἀσπίδες πολὺ μᾶλλον τῶν θωράκων καὶ τῶν γέρρων καὶ στεγάζουσι τὰ σώματα καὶ πρὸς τὸ ὠθεῖσθαι συνεργάζονται πρὸς τοῖς ὤμοις οὖσαι .
for the spears that they use even unto this day are long and powerful, and their shields cover their bodies much more effectually than corselets and targets, and as they rest against the shoulder they are a help in shoving.


7.1.33
3618
συγκλείσαντες οὖν τὰς ἀσπίδας ἐχώρουν καὶ ἐώθουν .
So, locking their shields together, they advanced and shoved.


7.1.34
3619
οἱ δὲ Πέρσαι οὐκ ἐδύναντο ἀντέχειν , ἅτε ἐν ἄκραις ταῖς χερσὶ τὰ γέρρα ἔχοντες , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ πόδα ἀνεχάζοντο παίοντες καὶ παιόμενοι , ἕως ὑπὸ ταῖς μηχαναῖς ἐγένοντο .
And because the Persians had to hold out their little shields clutched in their hands, they were unable to hold the line, but were forced back foot by foot, giving and taking blows, until they came up under cover of the moving towers.


7.1.34
3620
ἐπεὶ μέντοι ἐνταῦθα ἦλθον , ἐπαίοντο αὖθις οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἀπὸ τῶν πύργων ·
When they reached that point, the Egyptians in turn received a volley from the towers;


7.1.34
3621
καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ πᾶσι δὲ οὐκ εἴων φεύγειν οὔτε τοὺς τοξότας οὔτε τοὺς ἀκοντιστάς , ἀλλ’ ἀνατεταμένοι τὰς μαχαίρας ἠνάγκαζον καὶ τοξεύειν καὶ ἀκοντίζειν .
and the forces in the extreme rear would not allow any retreat on the part of either archers or lancers, but with drawn swords they compelled them to shoot and hurl.


7.1.35
3622
ἦν δὲ πολὺς μὲν ἀνδρῶν φόνος , πολὺς δὲ κτύπος ὅπλων καὶ βελῶν παντοδαπῶν , πολλὴ δὲ βοὴ τῶν μὲν ἀνακαλούντων ἀλλήλους , τῶν δὲ παρακελευομένων , τῶν δὲ θεοὺς ἐπικαλουμένων .
Then there was a dreadful carnage, an awful din of arms and missiles of every sort, and a great tumult of men, as they called to one another for aid, or exhorted one another, or invoked the gods.


7.1.36
3623
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ Κῦρος διώκων τοὺς καθ’ αὑτὸν παραγίγνεται .
At this juncture Cyrus came up in pursuit of the part that had been opposed to him;


7.1.36
3624
ὡς δ’ εἶδε τοὺς Πέρσας ἐκ τῆς χώρας ἐωσμένους , ἤλγησέ τε καὶ γνοὺς ὅτι οὐδαμῶς ἂν θᾶττον σχοίη τοὺς πολεμίους τῆς εἰς τὸ πρόσθεν προόδου ἢ εἰ εἰς τὸ ὄπισθεν περιελάσειεν αὐτῶν , παραγγείλας ἕπεσθαι τοῖς μεθ’ αὑτοῦ περιήλαυνεν εἰς τὸ ὄπισθεν ·
and when he saw that the Persians had been forced from their position, he was grieved; but as he realized that he could in no way check the enemy’s progress more quickly than by marching around behind them, he ordered his men to follow him and rode around to the rear;


7.1.36
3625
καὶ εἰσπεσόντες παίουσιν ἀφορῶντας καὶ πολλοὺς κατακαίνουσιν .
There he fell upon the enemy as they faced the other way and smote them and slew many of them.


7.1.37
3626
οἱ δὲ Αἰγύπτιοι ὡς ᾔσθοντο , ἐβόων τε ὅτι ὄπισθεν οἱ πολέμιοι καὶ ἐστρέφοντο ἐν ταῖς πληγαῖς .
And when the Egyptians became aware of their position they shouted out that the enemy was in their rear, and amidst the blows they faced about.


7.1.37
3627
καὶ ἐνταῦθα δὴ φύρδην ἐμάχοντο καὶ πεζοὶ καὶ ἱππεῖς , πεπτωκὼς δέ τις ὑπὸ τῷ Κύρου ἵππῳ καὶ πατούμενος παίει εἰς τὴν γαστέρα τῇ μαχαίρᾳ τὸν ἵππον αὐτοῦ ·
And then they fought promiscuously both foot and horse; and a certain man, who had fallen under Cyrus’s horse and was under the animal’s heels, struck the horse in the belly with his sword.


7.1.37
3628
ὁ δὲ ἵππος πληγεὶς σφαδᾴζων ἀποσείεται τὸν Κῦρον .
And the horse thus wounded plunged convulsively and threw Cyrus off.


7.1.38
3629
ἔνθα δὴ ἔγνω ἄν τις ὅσου ἄξιον εἴη τὸ φιλεῖσθαι ἄρχοντα ὑπὸ τῶν περὶ αὐτόν .
Then one might have realized how much it is worth to an officer to be loved by his men;


7.1.38
3630
εὐθὺς γὰρ ἀνεβόησάν τε πάντες καὶ προσπεσόντες ἐμάχοντο ·
for they all at once cried out and leaping forward they fought,


7.1.38
3631
ἐώθουν , ἐωθοῦντο , ἔπαιον , ἐπαίοντο .
They shoved and were shoved, gave and received blows.


7.1.38
3632
καταπηδήσας δέ τις ἀπὸ τοῦ ἵππου τῶν τοῦ Κύρου ὑπηρετῶν ἀναβάλλει αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν ἑαυτοῦ ἵππον .
And one of his aides-de-camp leaped down from his own horse and helped him mount upon it;


7.1.39
3633
ὡς δ’ ἀνέβη ὁ Κῦρος , κατεῖδε πάντοθεν ἤδη παιομένους τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους ·
and when Cyrus had mounted he saw that the Egyptians were now assailed on every side;


7.1.39
3634
καὶ γὰρ Ὑστάσπας ἤδη παρῆν σὺν τοῖς Περσῶν ἱππεῦσι καὶ Χρυσάντας .
for Hystaspas also and Chrysantas had now come up with the Persian cavalry.


7.1.39
3635
ἀλλὰ τούτους ἐμβάλλειν μὲν οὐκέτι εἴα εἰς τὴν φάλαγγα τῶν Αἰγυπτίων , ἔξωθεν δὲ τοξεύειν καὶ ἀκοντίζειν ἐκέλευεν .
But he did not permit them yet to charge into the Egyptian phalanx, but bade them shoot and hurl from a distance.


7.1.39
3636
ὡς δ’ ἐγένετο περιελαύνων παρὰ τὰς μηχανάς , ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ ἀναβῆναι ἐπὶ τῶν πύργων τινὰ καὶ κατασκέψασθαι εἴ πῃ καὶ ἄλλο τι μένοι τῶν πολεμίων καὶ μάχοιτο .
And when, as he rode round, he came to the engines, he decided to ascend one of the towers and take a view to see if anywhere any part of the enemy’s forces were making a stand to fight.


7.1.40
3637
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀνέβη , κατεῖδε μεστὸν τὸ πεδίον ἵππων , ἀνθρώπων , ἁρμάτων , φευγόντων , διωκόντων , κρατούντων , κρατουμένων ·
And when he had ascended the tower, he looked down upon the field full of horses and men and chariots, some fleeing, some pursuing, some victorious, other vanquished;


7.1.40
3638
μένον δ’ οὐδαμοῦ οὐδὲν ἔτι ἐδύνατο κατιδεῖν πλὴν τὸ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ·
but nowhere could he discover any division that was still standing its ground, except that of the Egyptians;


7.1.40
3639
οὗτοι δὲ ἐπειδὴ ἠποροῦντο , πάντοθεν κύκλον ποιησάμενοι , ὥστε ὁρᾶσθαι τὰ ὅπλα , ὑπὸ ταῖς ἀσπίσιν ἐκάθηντο ·
and they, inasmuch as they found themselves in a desperate condition, formed in a complete circle and crouched behind their shields, so that only their weapons were visible;


7.1.40
3640
καὶ ἐποίουν μὲν οὐδὲν ἔτι , ἔπασχον δὲ πολλὰ καὶ δεινά .
but they were no longer accomplishing anything, but were suffering very heavy loss.


7.1.41
3641
ἀγασθεὶς δὲ ὁ Κῦρος αὐτοὺς καὶ οἰκτίρων ὅτι ἀγαθοὶ ἄνδρες ὄντες ἀπώλλυντο , ἀνεχώρισε πάντας τοὺς περιμαχομένους καὶ μάχεσθαι οὐδένα ἔτι εἴα .
And Cyrus, filled with admiration for their conduct and moved to pity for them that men as brave as they were should be slain, drew off all those who were fighting around the ring and allowed no one to fight any more.


7.1.41
3642
πέμπει δὲ πρὸς αὐτοὺς κήρυκα ἐρωτῶν πότερα βούλονται ἀπολέσθαι πάντες ὑπὲρ τῶν προδεδωκότων αὐτοὺς ἢ σωθῆναι ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ δοκοῦντες εἶναι .
Then he sent a herald to them to ask whether they all wished to die for those who had treacherously deserted them or to save their lives and at the same time be accounted brave men.


7.1.41
3643
οἱ δ’ ἀπεκρίναντο ·
They answered:


7.1.41
3644
πῶς δ’ ἂν ἡμεῖς σωθείημεν ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ δοκοῦντες εἶναι ;
How could we save our lives  and at the same time be accounted brave men?


7.1.42
3645
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος πάλιν ἔλεγεν ·
Cyrus replied:


7.1.42
3646
ὅτι ἡμεῖς ὑμᾶς ὁρῶμεν μόνους καὶ μένοντας καὶ μάχεσθαι θέλοντας .
You can, because we are witnesses that you are the only ones who stood your ground and were willing to fight.


7.1.42
3647
ἀλλὰ τ- ἐντεῦθεν , ἔφασαν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι , τί καλὸν ἂν ποιοῦντες σωθείημεν ;
Well, answered the Egyptians, granting that, what can we do consistently with honour to save our lives?


7.1.42
3648
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος αὖ πρὸς τοῦτο εἶπεν ·
Cyrus answered again:


7.1.42
3649
εἰ τῶν τε συμμαχομένων μηδένα προδόντες σωθείητε τά τε ὅπλα παραδόντες φίλοι τε γενόμενοι τοῖς αἱρουμένοις ὑμᾶς σῶσαι , ἐξὸν ἀπολέσαι .
You could surrender your arms and become friends of those who choose to save you, when it is in their power to destroy you.


7.1.43
3650
ἀκούσαντες ταῦτα ἐπήροντο ·
On hearing that, they asked,


7.1.43
3651
ἢν δὲ γενώμεθά σοι φίλοι , τί ἡμῖν ἀξιώσεις χρῆσθαι ;
And if we become your friends, how will you see fit to deal with us?


7.1.43
3652
ἀπεκρίνατο ὁ Κῦρος εὖ ποιεῖν καὶ εὖ πάσχειν .
I will do you favours and expect favours from you, answered Cyrus.


7.1.43
3653
ἐπηρώτων πάλιν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τίνα εὐεργεσίαν ·
What sort of favours? asked the Egyptians in turn.


7.1.43
3654
πρὸς τοῦτο εἶπεν ὁ Κῦρος ·
As long as the war continues, Cyrus made answer to this,


7.1.43
3655
μισθὸν μὲν ὑμῖν δοίην ἂν πλείονα ἢ νῦν ἐλαμβάνετε ὅσον ἂν χρόνον πόλεμος ᾖ ·
I would give you larger pay than you were now receiving;


7.1.43
3656
εἰρήνης δὲ γενομένης τῷ βουλομένῳ ὑμῶν μένειν παρ’ ἐμοὶ χώραν τε δώσω καὶ πόλεις καὶ γυναῖκας καὶ οἰκέτας .
and when peace is made, to those of you who care to stay with me I will give lands and cities and wives and servants.


7.1.44
3657
ἀκούσαντες ταῦτα οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὸ μὲν ἐπὶ Κροῖσον συστρατεύειν ἀφελεῖν σφίσιν ἐδεήθησαν ·
On hearing this, the Egyptians begged to be excused from taking part in any campaign against Croesus,


7.1.44
3658
τούτῳ γὰρ μόνῳ γιγνώσκεσθαι ἔφασαν ·
for with him alone, they said, they were acquainted;


7.1.44
3659
τὰ δ’ ἄλλα συνομολογήσαντες ἔδοσαν πίστιν καὶ ἔλαβον .
all other stipulations they accepted, and gave and received pledges of good faith.


7.1.45
3660
καὶ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοί τε οἱ καταμείναντες τότε ἔτι καὶ νῦν βασιλεῖ πιστοὶ διαμένουσι , Κῦρός τε πόλεις αὐτοῖς ἔδωκε , τὰς μὲν ἄνω , αἳ ἔτι καὶ νῦν πόλεις Αἰγυπτίων καλοῦνται , Λάρισαν δὲ καὶ Κυλλήνην παρὰ Κύμην πλησίον θαλάττης , ἃς ἔτι καὶ νῦν οἱ ἀπ’ ἐκείνων ἔχουσι .
And the Egyptians who then stayed in the country have continued loyal subjects to the king even unto this day; and Cyrus gave them cities, some in the interior, which even to this day are called Egyptian cities, and besides these Larissa and Cyllene near Cyme on the coast; and their descendants dwell there even unto this day.


7.1.45
3661
ταῦτα δὲ διαπραξάμενος ὁ Κῦρος ἤδη σκοταῖος ἀναγαγὼν ἐστρατοπεδεύσατο ἐν Θυμβράροις .
When he had accomplished this, it was already dark; and Cyrus led back his forces and encamped in Thymbrara.


7.1.46
3662
ἐν δὲ τῇ μάχῃ τῶν πολεμίων Αἰγύπτιοι μόνοι ηὐδοκίμησαν , τῶν δὲ σὺν Κύρῳ τὸ Περσῶν ἱππικὸν κράτιστον ἔδοξεν εἶναι ·
The Egyptians were the only ones of all the enemy that distinguished themselves in the battle,


7.1.46
3663
ὥστ’ ἔτι καὶ νῦν διαμένει ἡ ὅπλισις ἣν τότε Κῦρος τοῖς ἱππεῦσι κατεσκεύασεν .
while of those under Cyrus the Persian cavalry seemed to be the most efficient; and therefore the equipment which Cyrus had then provided for his cavalry continues in use even to our own times.


7.1.47
3664
ηὐδοκίμησε δὲ ἰσχυρῶς καὶ τὰ δρεπανηφόρα ἅρματα ·
The scythe-bearing chariots also won extraordinary distinction,


7.1.47
3665
ὥστε καὶ τοῦτο ἔτι καὶ νῦν διαμένει τὸ πολεμιστήριον τῷ ἀεὶ βασιλεύοντι .
so that this military device also has been retained even to our day by each successive king.


7.1.48
3666
αἱ μέντοι κάμηλοι ἐφόβουν μόνον τοὺς ἵππους , οὐ μέντοι κατέκαινόν γε οἱ ἐπ’ αὐτῶν ἱππεῖς , οὐδ’ αὐτοί γε ἀπέθνῃσκον ὑπὸ ἱππέων ·
The camels, however, did nothing more than frighten the horses;


7.1.48
3667
οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἵππος ἐπέλαζε .
their riders could neither kill any one nor be killed by any of the enemy’s cavalry, for not a horse would come near them.


7.1.49
3668
καὶ χρήσιμον μὲν ἐδόκει εἶναι ·
What they did do seemed useful enough;


7.1.49
3669
ἀλλὰ γὰρ οὔτε τρέφειν οὐδεὶς ἐθέλει καλὸς κ- ἀγαθὸς κάμηλον ὥστ’ ἐποχεῖσθαι οὔτε μελετᾶν ὡς πολεμήσων ἀπὸ τούτων .
but be that as it may, no gentleman is willing to keep a camel for riding or to practise for fighting in war upon one.


7.1.49
3670
οὕτω δὴ ἀπολαβοῦσαι πάλιν τὸ ἑαυτῶν σχῆμα ἐν τοῖς σκευοφόροις διάγουσι .
And so they have again taken their proper position and do service among the pack-animals.


7.2.1
3671
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀμφὶ τὸν Κῦρον δειπνοποιησάμενοι καὶ φυλακὰς καταστησάμενοι , ὥσπερ ἔδει , ἐκοιμήθησαν .
When Cyrus and his men had finished dinner and stationed guards, as was necessary, they went to rest.


7.2.1
3672
Κροῖσος μέντοι εὐθὺς ἐπὶ Σάρδεων ἔφευγε σὺν τῷ στρατεύματι ·
As for Croesus and his army, they fled straight towards Sardis,


7.2.1
3673
τὰ δ’ ἄλλα φῦλα ὅποι ἐδύνατο προσωτάτω ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ τῆς ἐπ’ οἶκον ὁδοῦ ἕκαστος ἀπεχώρει .
while the other contingents got away, each man as far as he could under cover of the night on his way toward home.


7.2.2
3674
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο , εὐθὺς ἐπὶ Σάρδεις ἦγε Κῦρος .
When daylight came, Cyrus led his army straight on against Sardis.


7.2.2
3675
ὡς δ’ ἐγένετο πρὸς τῷ τείχει τῷ ἐν Σάρδεσι , τάς τε μηχανὰς ἀνίστη ὡς προσβαλῶν πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος καὶ κλίμακας παρεσκευάζετο .
And as soon as he came up to the walls of the city, he set up his engines as if intending to assault it and made ready his scaling ladders.


7.2.3
3676
ταῦτα δὲ ποιῶν κατὰ τὰ ἀποτομώτατα δοκοῦντα εἶναι τοῦ Σαρδιανῶν ἐρύματος τῆς ἐπιούσης νυκτὸς ἀναβιβάζει Χαλδαίους τε καὶ Πέρσας .
But though he did this, in the course of the following night he sent some Chaldaeans and Persians to climb up by what was considered the most precipitous side of the Sardian citadel.


7.2.3
3677
ἡγήσατο δ’ αὐτοῖς ἀνὴρ Πέρσης δοῦλος γεγενημένος τῶν ἐν τῇ ἀκροπόλει τινὸς φρουρῶν καὶ καταμεμαθηκὼς κατάβασιν εἰς τὸν ποταμὸν καὶ ἀνάβασιν τὴν αὐτήν .
The way was shown them by a Persian who had been the slave of one of the guards of the acropolis and had discovered a way down to the river and up again by the same route.


7.2.4
3678
ὡς δ’ ἐγένετο τοῦτο δῆλον ὅτι εἴχετο τὰ ἄκρα , πάντες δὴ ἔφευγον οἱ Λυδοὶ ἀπὸ τῶν τειχῶν ὅποι ἐδύνατο ἕκαστος τῆς πόλεως .
When it became known that the citadel was taken, all the Lydians immediately fled from the walls to whatever part of the city they could.


7.2.4
3679
Κῦρος δὲ ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ εἰσῄει εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ παρήγγειλεν ἐκ τῆς τάξεως μηδένα κινεῖσθαι .
And Cyrus at daybreak entered the city and gave orders that not a man of his should stir from his post.


7.2.5
3680
ὁ δὲ Κροῖσος κατακλεισάμενος ἐν τοῖς βασιλείοις Κῦρον ἐβόα ·
But Croesus shut himself up in his palace and called for Cyrus.


7.2.5
3681
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τοῦ μὲν Κροίσου φύλακας κατέλιπεν , αὐτὸς δὲ ἀπαγαγὼν πρὸς τὴν ἐχομένην ἄκραν ὡς εἶδε τοὺς μὲν Πέρσας φυλάττοντας τὴν ἄκραν , ὥσπερ ἔδει , τὰ δὲ τῶν Χαλδαίων ὅπλα ἔρημα ( κατεδεδραμήκεσαν γὰρ ἁρπασόμενοι τὰ ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ) , εὐθὺς συνεκάλεσεν αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἀπιέναι ἐκ τοῦ στρατεύματος ὡς τάχιστα .
Cyrus, however, left behind a guard to watch Croesus, while he himself drew off his army to the citadel now in his possession; for he saw that the Persians were holding guard over it, as it was their duty to do, but that the quarters of the Chaldaeans were deserted, for they had run down into the city to get plunder from the houses. He at once called their officers together and told them to leave his army with all speed.


7.2.6
3682
οὐ γὰρ ἄν , ἔφη , ἀνασχοίμην πλεονεκτοῦντας ὁρῶν τοὺς ἀτακτοῦντας .
For said he, I could not endure to see men who are guilty of insubordination better off than others.


7.2.6
3683
καὶ εὖ μέν , ἔφη , ἐπίστασθε ὅτι παρεσκευαζόμην ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς τοὺς ἐμοὶ συστρατευομένους πᾶσι Χαλδαίοις μακαριστοὺς ποιῆσαι ·
And let me tell you, he added, that I was getting ready to make you Chaldaeans who have been helping in my campaigns objects of envy in the eyes of all other Chaldaeans;


7.2.6
3684
νῦν δ’ , ἔφη , μὴ θαυμάζετε ἤν τις καὶ ἀπιοῦσιν ὑμῖν κρείττων ἐντύχῃ .
but, as it is, you need not be surprised if some one who is your superior in strength should fall in with you, even as you go away.


7.2.7
3685
ἀκούσαντες ταῦτα οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ἔδεισάν τε καὶ ἱκέτευον παύσασθαι ὀργιζόμενον καὶ τὰ χρήματα πάντα ἀποδώσειν ἔφασαν .
When they heard this, the Chaldaeans were afraid; they besought him to lay aside his wrath and promised to give up their plunder.


7.2.7
3686
ὁ δ’ εἶπεν ὅτι οὐδὲν αὐτῶν δέοιτο .
But he said he did not want it.


7.2.7
3687
ἀλλ’ εἴ με , ἔφη , βούλεσθε παύσασθαι ἀχθόμενον , ἀπόδοτε πάντα ὅσα ἐλάβετε τοῖς διαφυλάξασι τὴν ἄκραν .
But said he, if you wish me to forget my displeasure, surrender all that you have taken to those who have not relaxed their guard of the citadel.


7.2.7
3688
ἢν γὰρ αἴσθωνται οἱ ἄλλοι στρατιῶται ὅτι πλεονεκτοῦσιν οἱ εὔτακτοι γενόμενοι , πάντα μοι καλῶς ἕξει .
For if the rest of the soldiers find out that those who have been obedient to orders are better off than the rest, everything will be as I wish.


7.2.8
3689
οἱ μὲν δὴ Χαλδαῖοι οὕτως ἐποίησαν ὡς ἐκέλευσεν ὁ Κῦρος ·
The Chaldaeans, accordingly, did as Cyrus bade;


7.2.8
3690
καὶ ἔλαβον οἱ πειθόμενοι πολλὰ καὶ παντοῖα χρήματα .
and the obedient received a large amount of spoil of every description.


7.2.8
3691
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος καταστρατοπεδεύσας τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ , ὅπου ἐδόκει ἐπιτηδειότατον εἶναι τῆς πόλεως , μένειν ἐπὶ τοῖς ὅπλοις παρήγγειλε καὶ ἀριστοποιεῖσθαι .
And Cyrus encamped his men in that part of the city where he deemed it most convenient, ordering them to stay in their quarters and take luncheon there.


7.2.9
3692
ταῦτα δὲ διαπραξάμενος ἀγαγεῖν ἐκέλευσεν αὑτῷ τὸν Κροῖσον .
When he had attended to this, he ordered Croesus to be brought before him.


7.2.9
3693
ὁ δὲ Κροῖσος ὡς εἶδε τὸν Κῦρον , χαῖρε , ὦ δέσποτα , ἔφη ·
And when Croesus saw Cyrus, he said: I salute you, my sovereign lord;


7.2.9
3694
τοῦτο γὰρ ἡ τύχη καὶ ἔχειν τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦδε δίδωσι σοὶ καὶ ἐμοὶ προσαγορεύειν .
for fortune grants that henceforth you should bear this title and I address you by it.


7.2.10
3695
καὶ σύ γε , ἔφη , ὦ Κροῖσε , ἐπείπερ ἄνθρωποί γέ ἐσμεν ἀμφότεροι .
And I you, Croesus; for we are both men.


7.2.10
3696
ἀτάρ , ἔφη , ὦ Κροῖσε , ἆρ’ ἄν τί μοι ἐθελήσαις συμβουλεῦσαι ;
But, Croesus, he added, would you be willing to give me a bit of advice?


7.2.10
3697
καὶ βουλοίμην γ’ ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ἀγαθόν τί σοι εὑρεῖν ·
Aye, Cyrus, said he; I wish I could find something of practical value to say to you.


7.2.10
3698
τοῦτο γὰρ ἂν οἶμαι ἀγαθὸν κ- ἐμοὶ γενέσθαι .
For that, I think, would prove good for me as well.


7.2.11
3699
ἄκουσον τοίνυν , ἔφη , ὦ Κροῖσε ·
Listen, then, Croesus, said he.


7.2.11
3700
ἐγὼ γὰρ ὁρῶν τοὺς στρατιώτας πολλὰ πεπονηκότας καὶ πολλὰ κεκινδυνευκότας καὶ νῦν νομίζοντας πόλιν ἔχειν τὴν πλουσιωτάτην ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ μετὰ Βαβυλῶνα , ἀξιῶ ὠφεληθῆναι τοὺς στρατιώτας .
I observe that my soldiers have gone through many toils and dangers and now are thinking that they are in possession of the richest city in Asia, next to Babylon; and I think that they deserve some reward.


7.2.11
3701
γιγνώσκω γάρ , ἔφη , ὅτι εἰ μή τινα καρπὸν λήψονται τῶν πόνων , οὐ δυνήσομαι αὐτοὺς πολὺν χρόνον πειθομένους ἔχειν .
For I know that if they do not reap some fruit of their labours, I shall not be able to keep them in obedience very long.


7.2.11
3702
διαρπάσαι μὲν οὖν αὐτοῖς ἐφεῖναι τὴν πόλιν οὐ βούλομαι ·
Now, I do not wish to abandon the city to them to plunder;


7.2.11
3703
τήν τε γὰρ πόλιν νομίζω ἂν διαφθαρῆναι , ἔν τε τῇ ἁρπαγῇ εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι οἱ πονηρότατοι πλεονεκτήσειαν ἄν .
for I believe that then the city would be destroyed, and I am sure that in the pillaging the worst men would get the largest share.


7.2.12
3704
ἀκούσας ταῦτα ὁ Κροῖσος ἔλεξεν ·
Well said Croesus on hearing these words,


7.2.12
3705
ἀλλ’ ἐμέ , ἔφη , ἔασον λέξαι πρὸς οὓς ἂν ἐγὼ Λυδῶν ἔλθω ὅτι διαπέπραγμαι παρὰ σοῦ μὴ ποιῆσαι ἁρπαγὴν μηδὲ ἐᾶσαι ἀφανισθῆναι παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας ·
permit me to say to any Lydians that I meet that I have secured from you the promise not to permit any pillaging nor to allow the women and children to be carried off,


7.2.12
3706
ὑπεσχόμην δέ σοι ἀντὶ τούτων ἦ μὴν παρ’ ἑκόντων Λυδῶν ἔσεσθαι πᾶν ὅ τι καλὸν κ- ἀγαθόν ἐστιν ἐν Σάρδεσιν .
and that I, in return for that, have given you my solemn promise that you should get from the Lydians of their own free will everything there is of beauty or value in Sardis.


7.2.13
3707
ἢν γὰρ ταῦτα ἀκούσωσιν , οἶδ’ ὅτι ἥξει σοι πᾶν ὅ τι ἐστὶν ἐνθάδε καλὸν κτῆμα ἀνδρὶ καὶ γυναικί ·
For when they hear this, I am sure that whatever fair possession man or woman has will come to you;


7.2.13
3708
καὶ ὁμοίως εἰς νέωτα πολλῶν καὶ καλῶν πάλιν σοι πλήρης ἡ πόλις ἔσται .
and next year you will again find the city just as full of wealth as it is now;


7.2.13
3709
ἢν δὲ διαρπάσῃς , καὶ αἱ τέχναι σοι , ἃς πηγάς φασι τῶν καλῶν εἶναι , διεφθαρμέναι ἔσονται .
whereas, if you pillage it completely, you will find even the industrial arts utterly ruined; and they say that these are the fountain of wealth.


7.2.14
3710
ἐξέσται δέ σοι ἰδόντι ταῦτα ἐλθόντα ἔτι καὶ περὶ τῆς ἁρπαγῆς βουλεύσασθαι .
But when you have seen what is brought in, you will still have the privilege of deciding about plundering the city.


7.2.14
3711
πρῶτον δ’ , ἔφη , ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐμοὺς θησαυροὺς πέμπε καὶ παραλαμβανόντων οἱ σοὶ φύλακες παρὰ τῶν ἐμῶν φυλάκων .
And first of all, he went on, send to my treasuries and let your guards obtain from my guards what is there.


7.2.14
3712
ταῦτα μὲν δὴ πάντα οὕτω συνῄνεσε ποιεῖν ὁ Κῦρος ὥσπερ ἔλεξεν ὁ Κροῖσος .
All this, accordingly, Cyrus agreed to have done as Croesus suggested.


7.2.15
3713
τάδε δέ μοι πάντως , ἔφη , ὦ Κροῖσε , λέξον πῶς σοι ἀποβέβηκε τὰ ἐκ τοῦ ἐν Δελφοῖς χρηστηρίου ·
But pray tell me, Croesus, he resumed, what has come of your responses from the oracle at Delphi?


7.2.15
3714
σοὶ γὰρ δὴ λέγεται πάνυ γε τεθεραπεῦσθαι ὁ Ἀπόλλων καί σε πάντα ἐκείνῳ πειθόμενον πράττειν .
For it is said that Apollo has received much service from you and that everything that you do is done in obedience to him.


7.2.16
3715
ἐβουλόμην ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , οὕτως ἔχειν ·
I would it were so, Cyrus, he answered.


7.2.16
3716
νῦν δὲ πάντα τ- ἐναντία εὐθὺς ἐξ ἀρχῆς πράττων προσηνέχθην τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι .
But as it is; I have from the very beginning behaved toward Apollo in a way contrary to all that he has advised.


7.2.16
3717
πῶς δέ ;
Cyrus asked:


7.2.16
3718
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος ·
How so?


7.2.16
3719
δίδασκε ·
please explain;


7.2.16
3720
πάνυ γὰρ παράδοξα λέγεις .
for your statement sounds very strange.


7.2.17
3721
ὅτι πρῶτον μέν , ἔφη , ἀμελήσας ἐρωτᾶν τὸν θεόν , εἴ τι ἐδεόμην , ἀπεπειρώμην αὐτοῦ εἰ δύναιτο ἀληθεύειν .
At first, he answered, instead of asking the god for the particular favour I needed, I proceeded to put him to the test to see if he could tell the truth.


7.2.17
3722
τοῦτο δ’ , ἔφη , μὴ ὅτι θεός , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄνθρωποι καλοὶ κ- ἀγαθοί , ἐπειδὰν γνῶσιν ἀπιστούμενοι , οὐ φιλοῦσι τοὺς ἀπιστοῦντας .
And when even men, if they are gentlemen — to say nothing of a god — discover that they are mistrusted, they have no love for those who mistrust them.


7.2.18
3723
ἐπεὶ μέντοι ἔγνω καὶ μάλ’ ἄτοπα ἐμοῦ ποιοῦντος , καίπερ πρόσω Δελφῶν ἀπέχοντος , οὕτω δὴ πέμπω περὶ παίδων .
However, as he knew even about the gross absurdities I was engaged in, far as I was from Delphi , I then sent to him to inquire if I should have male issue.


7.2.19
3724
ὁ δέ μοι τὸ μὲν πρῶτον οὐδ’ ἀπεκρίνατο ·
And at first he did not even answer me;


7.2.19
3725
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐγὼ πολλὰ μὲν πέμπων ἀναθήματα χρυσᾶ , πολλὰ δ’ ἀργυρᾶ , πάμπολλα δὲ θύων ἐξιλασάμην ποτὲ αὐτόν , ὡς ἐδόκουν , τότε δή μοι ἀποκρίνεται ἐρωτῶντι τί ἄν μοι ποιήσαντι παῖδες γένοιντο ·
but when I had at last propitiated him, as I thought, by sending many offerings of gold and many of silver and by sacrificing very many victims, then he did answer my question as to what I should do to have sons;


7.2.19
3726
ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὅτι ἔσοιντο .
and he said that I should have them.


7.2.20
3727
καὶ ἐγένοντο μέν , οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδὲ τοῦτο ἐψεύσατο , γενόμενοι δὲ οὐδὲν ὤνησαν .
And I had; for not even in this did he speak falsely;


7.2.20
3728
ὁ μὲν γὰρ κωφὸς ὢν διετέλει , ὁ δὲ ἄριστος γενόμενος ἐν ἀκμῇ τοῦ βίου ἀπώλετο .
but those that were born to me have been no joy to me. For the one has continued dumb until now, and the other, the better of the two, was killed in the flower of his youth.


7.2.20
3729
πιεζόμενος δὲ ταῖς περὶ τοὺς παῖδας συμφοραῖς πάλιν πέμπω καὶ ἐπερωτῶ τὸν θεὸν τί ἂν ποιῶν τὸν λοιπὸν βίον εὐδαιμονέστατα διατελέσαιμι ·
Then, overwhelmed by the afflictions I suffered in connection with my sons, I sent again and inquired of the god what I should do to pass the rest of my life most happily;


7.2.20
3730
ὁ δέ μοι ἀπεκρίνατο , σαυτὸν γιγνώσκων εὐδαίμων , Κροῖσε , περάσεις .
and he answered me: Knowing thyself, O Croesus — thus shalt thou live and be happy.


7.2.21
3731
ἐγὼ δ’ ἀκούσας τὴν μαντείαν ἥσθην ·
And when I heard this response, I was glad;


7.2.21
3732
ἐνόμιζον γὰρ τὸ ῥᾷστόν μοι αὐτὸν προστάξαντα τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν διδόναι .
for I thought that it was the easiest task in the world that he was laying upon me as the condition to happiness.


7.2.21
3733
ἄλλους μὲν γὰρ γιγνώσκειν τοὺς μὲν οἷόν τ’ εἶναι τοὺς δ’ οὔ ·
For in the case of others, it is possible to know some; and some, one cannot know;


7.2.21
3734
ἑαυτὸν δὲ ὅστις ἐστὶ πάντα τινὰ ἐνόμιζον ἄνθρωπον εἰδέναι .
but I thought that everybody knows who and what he himself is.


7.2.22
3735
καὶ τὸν μετὰ ταῦτα δὴ χρόνον , ἕως μὲν εἶχον ἡσυχίαν , οὐδὲν ἐνεκάλουν μετὰ τὸν τοῦ παιδὸς θάνατον ταῖς τύχαις ·
For the succeeding years, as long as I lived at peace, I had no complaint to make of my fortunes after the death of my son.


7.2.22
3736
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἀνεπείσθην ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς στρατεύεσθαι , εἰς πάντα κίνδυνον ἦλθον ·
But when I was persuaded by the Assyrian king to take the field against you, I fell into every sort of danger.


7.2.22
3737
ἐσώθην μέντοι οὐδὲν κακὸν λαβών .
However, I was saved without having suffered any harm.


7.2.22
3738
οὐκ αἰτιῶμαι δὲ οὐδὲ τάδε τὸν θεόν .
Here again I have no fault to find with the god.


7.2.22
3739
ἐπεὶ γὰρ ἔγνων ἐμαυτὸν μὴ ἱκανὸν ὑμῖν μάχεσθαι , ἀσφαλῶς σὺν τῷ θεῷ ἀπῆλθον καὶ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ σὺν ἐμοί .
For when I recognized that I was not your match in battle, with his help I got off in safety, both I and my men.


7.2.23
3740
νῦν δ’ αὖ πάλιν ὑπό τε πλούτου τοῦ παρόντος διαθρυπτόμενος καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν δεομένων μου προστάτην γενέσθαι καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν δώρων ὧν ἐδίδοσάν μοι καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων , οἵ με κολακεύοντες ἔλεγον ὡς εἰ ἐγὼ θέλοιμι ἄρχειν , πάντες ἂν ἐμοὶ πείθοιντο καὶ μέγιστος ἂν εἴην ἀνθρώπων , ὑπὸ τοιούτων δὲ λόγων ἀναφυσώμενος , ὡς εἵλοντό με πάντες οἱ κύκλῳ βασιλεῖς προστάτην τοῦ πολέμου ,
And lately again, spoiled by the wealth I had and by those who were begging me to become their leader, by the gifts they gave me and by the people who flattered me, saying that if I would consent to take command they would all obey me and I should be the greatest of men — puffed up by such words, when all the princes round about chose me to be their leader in the war, I accepted the command, deeming myself fit to be the greatest; but, as it seems, I did not know myself .


7.2.24
3741
ὑπεδεξάμην τὴν στρατηγίαν , ὡς ἱκανὸς ὢν μέγιστος γενέσθαι , ἀγνοῶν ἄρα ἐμαυτόν , ὅτι σοὶ ἀντιπολεμεῖν ἱκανὸς ᾤμην εἶναι , πρῶτον μὲν ἐκ θεῶν γεγονότι , ἔπειτα δὲ διὰ βασιλέων πεφυκότι , ἔπειτα δ’ ἐκ παιδὸς ἀρετὴν ἀσκοῦντι · τῶν δ’ ἐμῶν προγόνων ἀκούω τὸν πρῶτον βασιλεύσαντα ἅμα τε βασιλέα καὶ ἐλεύθερον γενέσθαι .
For I thought I was capable of carrying on war against you; but I was no match for you; for you are in the first place a scion of the gods and in the second place the descendant of an unbroken line of kings, and finally you have been practising virtue from your childhood on, while the first of my ancestors to wear a crown, I am told, was at the same time king and freedman.


7.2.24
3742
ταῦτ’ οὖν ἀγνοήσας δικαίως , ἔφη , ἔχω τὴν δίκην .
Therefore, as I was thus without knowledge, I have my just deserts.


7.2.25
3743
ἀλλὰ νῦν δή , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , γιγνώσκω μὲν ἐμαυτόν ·
But, Cyrus, said he, I know myself now.


7.2.25
3744
σὺ δ’ , ἔφη , ἔτι δοκεῖς ἀληθεύειν τὸν Ἀπόλλω ὡς εὐδαίμων ἔσομαι γιγνώσκων ἐμαυτόν ;
But do you think Apollo’s declaration still holds true, that if I know myself I shall be happy?


7.2.25
3745
σὲ δὲ ἐρωτῶ διὰ τοῦτο ὅτι ἄριστ’ ἄν μοι δοκεῖς εἰκάσαι τοῦτο ἐν τῷ παρόντι ·
I ask you this for the reason that under the present circumstances it seems to me you can judge best;


7.2.25
3746
καὶ γὰρ δύνασαι ποιῆσαι .
for you are also in a position to fulfil it.


7.2.26
3747
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε ·
You must give me time to consider this, Croesus, Cyrus replied;


7.2.26
3748
βουλήν μοι δὸς περὶ τούτου , ὦ Κροῖσε ·
for when I think of your happiness hitherto, I am sorry for you,


7.2.26
3749
ἐγὼ γάρ σου ἐννοῶν τὴν πρόσθεν εὐδαιμονίαν οἰκτίρω τέ σε καὶ ἀποδίδωμι ἤδη γυναῖκά τε ἔχειν ἣν εἶχες καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ( ἀκούω γάρ σοι εἶναι ) , καὶ τοὺς φίλους καὶ τοὺς θεράποντας καὶ τράπεζαν σὺν οἵᾳπερ ἐζῆτε ·
and I now restore to you your wife, whom you once had, your daughters (for I understand you have daughters), your friends, your servants, and the table that you and yours used to enjoy.


7.2.26
3750
μάχας δέ σοι καὶ πολέμους ἀφαιρῶ .
But wars and battles I must forbid you.


7.2.27
3751
μὰ Δία μηδὲν τοίνυν , ἔφη ὁ Κροῖσος , σὺ ἐμοὶ ἔτι βουλεύου ἀποκρίνασθαι περὶ τῆς ἐμῆς εὐδαιμονίας ·
In the name of Zeus, said Croesus, pray do not trouble yourself further to answer me in regard to my happiness;


7.2.27
3752
ἐγὼ γὰρ ἤδη σοι λέγω , ἢν ταῦτά μοι ποιήσῃς ἃ λέγεις , ὅτι ἣν ἄλλοι τε μακαριωτάτην ἐνόμιζον εἶναι βιοτὴν καὶ ἐγὼ συνεγίγνωσκον αὐτοῖς , ταύτην καὶ ἐγὼ νῦν ἔχων διάξω .
for I assure you even now that if you do for me what you say you will, I, too, shall have and enjoy that life which others have always considered most blissful; and I have agreed with them.


7.2.28
3753
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε ·
And who is it, asked Cyrus, that enjoys such a life of bliss?


7.2.28
3754
τίς δὴ ὁ ἔχων ταύτην τὴν μακαρίαν βιοτήν ;
My wife, Cyrus, said he.


7.2.28
3755
ἡ ἐμὴ γυνή , εἶπεν , ὦ Κῦρε ·
For she always shared equally with me my wealth and the luxuries and all the good cheer that it brought,


7.2.28
3756
ἐκείνη γὰρ τῶν μὲν ἀγαθῶν καὶ τῶν μαλακῶν καὶ εὐφροσυνῶν πασῶν ἐμοὶ τὸ ἴσον μετεῖχε , φροντίδων δὲ ὅπως ταῦτα ἔσται καὶ πολέμου καὶ μάχης οὐ μετῆν αὐτῇ .
but she had no share in the anxieties of securing it nor in war or battle.


7.2.28
3757
οὕτω δὴ καὶ σὺ δοκεῖς ἐμὲ κατασκευάζειν ὥσπερ ἐγὼ ἣν ἐφίλουν μάλιστα ἀνθρώπων , ὥστε τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι ἄλλα μοι δοκῶ χαριστήρια ὀφειλήσειν .
So, then, you seem to be putting me in the same position as I did her whom I loved more than all the world, so that I feel that I shall owe Apollo new thank-offerings.


7.2.29
3758
ἀκούσας δ’ ὁ Κῦρος τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ ἐθαύμασε μὲν τὴν εὐθυμίαν , ἦγε δὲ τὸ λοιπὸν ὅποι καὶ αὐτὸς πορεύοιτο , εἴτε ἄρα καὶ χρήσιμόν τι νομίζων αὐτὸν εἶναι εἴτε καὶ ἀσφαλέστερον οὕτως ἡγούμενος .
At hearing these words Cyrus  wondered at his good spirits, and after that he always used to take Croesus with him wherever he went, whether, as may well have been, because he thought Croesus was of some service to him, or whether he considered that this was the safer course.


7.3.1
3759
καὶ τότε μὲν οὕτως ἐκοιμήθησαν .
Such was their interview, and then they went to rest.


7.3.1
3760
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ καλέσας ὁ Κῦρος τοὺς φίλους καὶ τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τοῦ στρατεύματος , τοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν ἔταξε τοὺς θησαυροὺς παραλαμβάνειν , τοὺς δ’ ἐκέλευσεν ὁπόσα παραδοίη Κροῖσος χρήματα , πρῶτον μὲν τοῖς θεοῖς ἐξελεῖν ὁποῖ’ ἂν οἱ μάγοι ἐξηγῶνται , ἔπειτα τ- ἄλλα χρήματα παραδεχομένους ἐν ζυγάστροις στήσαντας ἐφ’ ἁμαξῶν ἐπισκευάσαι καὶ διαλαχόντας τὰς ἁμάξας κομίζειν ὅποιπερ ἂν αὐτοὶ πορεύωνται , ἵνα ὅπου καιρὸς εἴη διαλαμβάνοιεν ἕκαστοι τὰ ἄξια .
And on the following day Cyrus summoned his friends and the general officers of his army. He appointed some of them to take charge of the treasures and others he ordered first to select from the valuables that Croesus delivered such a portion for the gods as the magi should designate; the rest they should then take into their own charge and put in chests, and these they should pack upon the wagons; they should then divide the wagons by lot and convey them whithersoever they themselves might go; then, when the time came, the treasure should be divided, and each man should receive his share according to his deserts.


7.3.2
3761
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἐποίουν .
The officers, accordingly, proceeded to follow his instructions.


7.3.2
3762
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος καλέσας τινὰς τῶν παρόντων ὑπηρετῶν , εἴπατέ μοι , ἔφη , ἑώρακέ τις ὑμῶν Ἀβραδάταν ;
And when he had called to him certain of his aides who were present, Cyrus said: Tell me, has any one of you seen Abradatas?


7.3.2
3763
θαυμάζω γάρ , ἔφη , ὅτι πρόσθεν θαμίζων ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς νῦν οὐδαμοῦ φαίνεται .
For I wonder why, in view of the fact that he used often to come to us, he is now nowhere to be seen.


7.3.3
3764
τῶν οὖν ὑπηρετῶν τις ἀπεκρίνατο ὅτι ὦ δέσποτα , οὐ ζῇ , ἀλλ’ ἐν τῇ μάχῃ ἀπέθανεν ἐμβαλὼν τὸ ἅρμα εἰς τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους ·
Sire, answered one of the aides, he is no longer alive, but he fell in the battle as he hurled his chariot against the ranks of the Egyptians,


7.3.3
3765
οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι πλὴν τῶν ἑταίρων αὐτοῦ ἐξέκλιναν , ὥς φασιν , ἐπεὶ τὸ στῖφος εἶδον τὸ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων .
while the rest, they say, all but himself and his companions, turned aside when they saw the dense host of the Egyptians.


7.3.4
3766
καὶ νῦν γε , ἔφη , λέγεται αὐτοῦ ἡ γυνὴ ἀνελομένη τὸν νεκρὸν καὶ ἐνθεμένη εἰς τὴν ἁρμάμαξαν , ἐν ᾗπερ αὐτὴ ὠχεῖτο , προσκεκομικέναι αὐτὸν ἐνθάδε ποι πρὸς τὸν Πακτωλὸν ποταμόν .
And even now his wife, I am told, has taken up his body for burial, placed it in the carriage in which she herself used to ride, and brought it to some place here by the River Pactolus.


7.3.5
3767
καὶ τοὺς μὲν εὐνούχους καὶ τοὺς θεράποντας αὐτοῦ ὀρύττειν φασὶν ἐπὶ λόφου τινὸς θήκην τῷ τελευτήσαντι ·
And his eunuchs and servants, so they say, are digging a grave upon a certain hill for his dead body.


7.3.5
3768
τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα λέγουσιν ὡς κάθηται χαμαὶ κεκοσμηκυῖα οἷς εἶχε τὸν ἄνδρα , τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἔχουσα ἐπὶ τοῖς γόνασι .
But his wife, they say, has decked her husband with what she possessed and now sits upon the ground, holding his head in her lap.


7.3.6
3769
ταῦτα ἀκούσας ὁ Κῦρος ἐπαίσατο ἄρα τὸν μηρὸν καὶ εὐθὺς ἀναπηδήσας ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον λαβὼν χιλίους ἱππέας ἤλαυνεν ἐπὶ τὸ πάθος .
Upon hearing this, Cyrus  smote his thigh, mounted his horse at once, and rode with a regiment of cavalry to the scene of sorrow.


7.3.7
3770
Γαδάταν δὲ καὶ Γωβρύαν ἐκέλευσεν ὅ τι δύναιντο λαβόντας καλὸν κόσμημα ἀνδρὶ φίλῳ καὶ ἀγαθῷ τετελευτηκότι μεταδιώκειν ·
He left orders for Gadatas and Gobryas to follow him with the most beautiful ornaments they could get for the man, who had fallen beloved and brave.


7.3.7
3771
καὶ ὅστις εἶχε τὰς ἑπομένας ἀγέλας , καὶ βοῦς καὶ ἵππους εἶπε τούτῳ καὶ ἅμα πρόβατα πολλὰ ἐλαύνειν ὅποι ἂν αὐτὸν πυνθάνηται ὄντα , ὡς ἐπισφαγείη τῷ Ἀβραδάτᾳ .
And he ordered those who had in charge the herds that were taken with the army to bring both cattle and horses and many sheep besides to the place where they should hear that he was, that he might sacrifice them in honour of Abradatas.


7.3.8
3772
ἐπεὶ δὲ εἶδε τὴν γυναῖκα χαμαὶ καθημένην καὶ τὸν νεκρὸν κείμενον , ἐδάκρυσέ τε ἐπὶ τῷ πάθει καὶ εἶπε ·
And when he saw the lady sitting upon the ground and the corpse lying there, he wept over his loss and said:


7.3.8
3773
φεῦ , ὦ ἀγαθὴ καὶ πιστὴ ψυχή , οἴχῃ δὴ ἀπολιπὼν ἡμᾶς ;
Alas, O brave and faithful soul, hast thou then gone and left us?


7.3.8
3774
καὶ ἅμα ἐδεξιοῦτο αὐτὸν καὶ ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ νεκροῦ ἐπηκολούθησεν ·
And with the words he clasped his hand, and the dead man’s hand came away in his grasp;


7.3.8
3775
ἀπεκέκοπτο γὰρ κοπίδι ὑπὸ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων .
for the wrist had been severed by a sabre in the hands of an Egyptian.


7.3.9
3776
ὁ δὲ ἰδὼν πολὺ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἤλγησε ·
And Cyrus was still more deeply moved at seeing this;


7.3.9
3777
καὶ ἡ γυνὴ δὲ ἀνωδύρατο καὶ δεξαμένη δὴ παρὰ τοῦ Κύρου ἐφίλησέ τε τὴν χεῖρα καὶ πάλιν ὡς οἷόν τ’ ἦν προσήρμοσε , καὶ εἶπε ·
and the wife wept aloud; but taking the hand from Cyrus, she kissed it and fitted it on again as best she could and said:


7.3.10
3778
καὶ τ- ἄλλα τοι , ὦ Κῦρε , οὕτως ἔχει ·
The rest of his limbs also you will find in the same condition, Cyrus;


7.3.10
3779
ἀλλὰ τί δεῖ σε ὁρᾶν ;
but why should you see it?


7.3.10
3780
καὶ ταῦτα , ἔφη , οἶδ’ ὅτι δι’ ἐμὲ οὐχ ἥκιστα ἔπαθεν , ἴσως δὲ καὶ διὰ σέ , ὦ Κῦρε , οὐδὲν ἧττον .
And I am in no small degree to blame that he has suffered so, and you, Cyrus, perhaps not less than I.


7.3.10
3781
ἐγώ τε γὰρ ἡ μώρα πολλὰ διεκελευόμην αὐτῷ οὕτω ποιεῖν , ὅπως σοι φίλος ἄξιος γενήσοιτο ·
For it was I that, in my folly, urged him to do his best to show himself a worthy friend to you;


7.3.10
3782
αὐτός τε οἶδ’ ὅτι οὗτος οὐ τοῦτο ἐνενόει ὅ τι πείσοιτο , ἀλλὰ τί ἄν σοι ποιήσας χαρίσαιτο .
and as for him, I know that he never had a thought of what might happen to him, but only of what he could do to please you.


7.3.10
3783
καὶ γὰρ οὖν , ἔφη , αὐτὸς μὲν ἀμέμπτως τετελεύτηκεν , ἐγὼ δ’ ἡ παρακελευομένη ζῶσα παρακάθημαι .
And so, she said, he has indeed died a blameless death, while I who urged him to it sit here alive!


7.3.11
3784
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος χρόνον μέν τινα σιωπῇ κατεδάκρυσεν , ἔπειτα δὲ ἐφθέγξατο ·
For some time Cyrus wept in silence and then he said aloud:


7.3.11
3785
ἀλλ’ οὗτος μὲν δή , ὦ γύναι , ἔχει τὸ κάλλιστον τέλος ·
Well, lady, he indeed has met the fairest of ends,


7.3.11
3786
νικῶν γὰρ τετελεύτηκε ·
for he has died in the very hour of victory;


7.3.11
3787
σὺ δὲ λαβοῦσα τοῖσδε ἐπικόσμει αὐτὸν τοῖς παρ’ ἐμοῦ ·
but do you accept these gifts from me —


7.3.11
3788
παρῆν δὲ ὁ Γωβρύας καὶ ὁ Γαδάτας πολὺν καὶ καλὸν κόσμον φέροντες ·
for Gobryas and Gadatas had come with many beautiful ornaments — and deck him with them.


7.3.11
3789
ἔπειτα δ’ , ἔφη , ἴσθι ὅτι οὐδὲ τὰ ἄλλα ἄτιμος ἔσται , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ μνῆμα πολλοὶ χώσουσιν ἀξίως ἡμῶν καὶ ἐπισφαγήσεται αὐτῷ ὅσα εἰκὸς ἀνδρὶ ἀγαθῷ .
And then, let me assure you that in other ways also he shall not want for honours, but many hands shall rear to him a monument worthy of us, and sacrifice shall be made over it, such as will befit a man so valiant.


7.3.12
3790
καὶ σὺ δ’ , ἔφη , οὐκ ἔρημος ἔσῃ , ἀλλ’ ἐγώ σε καὶ σωφροσύνης ἕνεκα καὶ πάσης ἀρετῆς καὶ τ- ἄλλα τιμήσω καὶ συστήσω ὅστις ἀποκομιεῖ σε ὅποι ἂν αὐτὴ ἐθέλῃς ·
And you, he continued, shall not be left friendless, but on account of your goodness and all your worth, I shall show you all honour;


7.3.12
3791
μόνον , ἔφη , δήλωσον πρὸς ἐμὲ πρὸς ὅντινα χρῄζεις κομισθῆναι .
and besides, I will commend to you some one to escort you to the place where you yourself desire to go. Only let me know to whom you wish to be conducted.


7.3.13
3792
καὶ ἡ Πάνθεια εἶπεν ·
Ah, Cyrus, Panthea answered, do not fear;


7.3.13
3793
ἀλλὰ θάρρει , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , οὐ μή σε κρύψω πρὸς ὅντινα βούλομαι ἀφικέσθαι .
I shall never hide from you who it is to whom I wish to go.


7.3.14
3794
ὁ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν ἀπῄει , κατοικτίρων τήν τε γυναῖκα οἵου ἀνδρὸς στέροιτο καὶ τὸν ἄνδρα οἵαν γυναῖκα καταλιπὼν οὐκέτ’ ὄψοιτο .
When he had said this, Cyrus went away, his heart full of pity for the woman, as he thought what a husband she had lost, and for the man, that he must leave such a wife and never see her more.


7.3.14
3795
ἡ δὲ γυνὴ τοὺς μὲν εὐνούχους ἐκέλευσεν ἀποστῆναι , ἕως ἄν , ἔφη , τόνδ’ ἐγὼ ὀδύρωμαι ὡς βούλομαι ·
The lady then desired the eunuchs to retire, until, she said, I have bewailed my husband here, as I desire.


7.3.14
3796
τῇ δὲ τροφῷ εἶπε παραμένειν , καὶ ἐπέταξεν αὐτῇ , ἐπειδὰν ἀποθάνῃ , περικαλύψαι αὐτήν τε καὶ τὸν ἄνδρα ἑνὶ ἱματίῳ .
But her nurse she told to stay with her, and she charged her to cover her and her husband, when she, too, was dead, with the same cloak.


7.3.14
3797
ἡ δὲ τροφὸς πολλὰ ἱκετεύουσα μὴ ποιεῖν τοῦτο , ἐπεὶ οὐδὲν ἥνυτε καὶ χαλεπαίνουσαν ἑώρα , ἐκάθητο κλαίουσα .
The nurse, however, pleaded earnestly with her not to do so; but when her prayers proved of no avail and she saw her mistress becoming angered, she sat down and burst into tears.


7.3.14
3798
ἡ δὲ ἀκινάκην πάλαι παρεσκευασμένον σπασαμένη σφάττει ἑαυτὴν καὶ ἐπιθεῖσα ἐπὶ τὰ στέρνα τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τὴν ἑαυτῆς κεφαλὴν ἀπέθνῃσκεν .
Panthea then drew out a dagger, with which she had provided herself long before, and plunged it into her heart, and laying her head upon her husband’s bosom she breathed her last.


7.3.14
3799
ἡ δὲ τροφὸς ἀνωλοφύρατό τε καὶ περιεκάλυπτεν ἄμφω ὥσπερ ἡ Πάνθεια ἐπέστειλεν .
Then the nurse wailed aloud and covered them both, even as Panthea had directed.


7.3.15
3800
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὡς ᾔσθετο τὸ ἔργον τῆς γυναικός , ἐκπλαγεὶς ἵεται , εἴ τι δύναιτο βοηθῆσαι .
When Cyrus heard what the woman had done, he was filled with dismay and hastened to the place to see if he could bring any help.


7.3.15
3801
οἱ δὲ εὐνοῦχοι ἰδόντες τὸ γεγενημένον , τρεῖς ὄντες σπασάμενοι κ- ἐκεῖνοι τοὺς ἀκινάκας ἀποσφάττονται οὗπερ ἔταξεν αὐτοὺς ἑστηκότες .
And when the eunuchs, three in number, beheld what had occurred, they also, standing in the spot where she had ordered them to stand, drew their daggers and drove them into their own breasts.


7.3.15
3802
καὶ νῦν τὸ μνῆμα μέχρι τοῦ νῦν τῶν εὐνούχων κεχῶσθαι λέγεται ·
And now even to this day, it is said, the monument of the eunuchs is still standing;


7.3.15
3803
καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν τῇ ἄνω στήλῃ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς καὶ τῆς γυναικὸς ἐπιγεγράφθαι φασὶ τὰ ὀνόματα , Σύρια γράμματα , κάτω δὲ εἶναι τρεῖς λέγουσι στήλας καὶ ἐπιγεγράφθαι σκηπτούχων .
and they say that the names of the husband and wife are inscribed in Assyrian letters upon the slab above; and below, it is said, are three slabs with the inscription the mace-bearers.


7.3.16
3804
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὡς ἐπλησίασε τῷ πάθει ἀγασθείς τε τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ κατολοφυράμενος ἀπῄει ·
And when Cyrus drew near to the place of sorrow he marvelled at the woman;


7.3.16
3805
καὶ τούτων μὲν ᾗ εἰκὸς ἐπεμελήθη ὡς τύχοιεν πάντων τῶν καλῶν , καὶ τὸ μνῆμα ὑπερμέγεθες ἐχώσθη , ὥς φασιν .
and having made lament over her, he went his way. He also took care that they should find all due honours, and the monument reared over them was, as they say, exceeding great.


7.4.1
3806
ἐκ δὲ τούτου στασιάζοντες οἱ Κᾶρες καὶ πολεμοῦντες πρὸς ἀλλήλους , ἅτε τὰς οἰκήσεις ἔχοντες ἐν ἐχυροῖς χωρίοις , ἑκάτεροι ἐπεκαλοῦντο τὸν Κῦρον .
Then the Carians fell into strife and civil war with one another; they were intrenched in strongholds, and both sides called upon Cyrus for assistance.


7.4.1
3807
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος αὐτὸς μὲν μένων ἐν Σάρδεσι μηχανὰς ἐποιεῖτο καὶ κριούς , ὡς τῶν μὴ πειθομένων ἐρείψων τὰ τείχη , Ἀδούσιον δὲ ἄνδρα Πέρσην καὶ τ- ἄλλα οὐκ ἄφρονα οὐδ’ ἀπόλεμον , καὶ πάνυ δὴ εὔχαριν , πέμπει ἐπὶ τὴν Καρίαν , στράτευμα δούς ·
So while Cyrus himself stayed in Sardis to make siege-engines and battering rams to demolish the walls of such as should refuse to submit, he entrusted an army to Adusius, a Persian who was not lacking in judgment generally and not unskilled in war, and who was besides a very courteous gentleman, and sent him into Caria;


7.4.1
3808
καὶ Κίλικες δὲ καὶ Κύπριοι πάνυ προθύμως αὐτῷ συνεστράτευσαν .
and the Cilicians and Cyprians also joined most heartily in this expedition.


7.4.2
3809
ὧν ἕνεκα οὐδ’ ἔπεμψε πώποτε Πέρσην σατράπην οὔτε Κιλίκων οὔτε Κυπρίων , ἀλλ’ ἤρκουν αὐτῷ αἰεὶ οἱ ἐπιχώριοι βασιλεύοντες ·
Because of their enthusiastic allegiance he never sent a Persian satrap to govern either the Cilicians or the Cyprians,


7.4.2
3810
δασμὸν μέντοι ἐλάμβανε καὶ στρατιᾶς ὁπότε δέοιτο ἐπήγγελλεν αὐτοῖς .
but was always satisfied with their native princes. Tribute, however, he did receive from them, and whenever he needed forces he made a requisition upon them for troops.


7.4.3
3811
ὁ δὲ Ἀδούσιος ἄγων τὸ στράτευμα ἐπὶ τὴν Καρίαν ἦλθε , καὶ ἀπ’ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν Καρῶν παρῆσαν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἕτοιμοι ὄντες δέχεσθαι εἰς τὰ τείχη ἐπὶ κακῷ τῶν ἀντιστασιαζόντων ·
Adusius now set out for Caria at the head of his army; and there came to him representatives from both parties of the Carians, ready to receive him into their walls to the injury of the rival faction.


7.4.3
3812
ὁ δὲ Ἀδούσιος πρὸς ἀμφοτέρους τ- αὐτὰ ἐποίει ·
But Adusius treated both sides alike:


7.4.3
3813
δικαιότερά τε ἔφη λέγειν τούτους ὁποτέροις διαλέγοιτο , λαθεῖν τε ἔφη δεῖν τοὺς ἐναντίους φίλους σφᾶς γενομένους , ὡς δὴ οὕτως ἂν μᾶλλον ἐπιπεσὼν ἀπαρασκεύοις τοῖς ἐναντίοις .
with whichever party he conferred, he said they were more in the right, but they must not let their opponents know that he and they had become friends, alleging that he would thus be more likely to fall upon those opponents unprepared.


7.4.3
3814
πιστὰ δ’ ἠξίου γενέσθαι , καὶ τοὺς μὲν Κᾶρας ὀμόσαι ἀδόλως τε δέξεσθαι εἰς τὰ τείχη σφᾶς καὶ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ τῷ Κύρου καὶ Περσῶν ·
Moreover, he demanded from the Carians pledges of good faith and made them swear to receive him without treachery within their walls to the advantage of Cyrus and the Persians;


7.4.3
3815
αὐτὸς δὲ ὀμόσαι θέλειν ἀδόλως εἰσιέναι εἰς τὰ τείχη καὶ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ τῶν δεχομένων .
and he himself consented to give his oath that he would without treachery enter their walls for the advantage of those who admitted him.


7.4.4
3816
ταῦτα δὲ ποιήσας ἀμφοτέροις λάθρᾳ ἑκατέρων νύκτα συνέθετο τὴν αὐτήν , καὶ ἐν ταύτῃ εἰσήλασέ τε εἰς τὰ τείχη καὶ παρέλαβε τὰ ἐρύματα ἀμφοτέρων .
And when he had done this, he made appointments with both parties for the same night — each party without the other’s knowledge — and on that night he marched inside the walls and took possession of the strongholds of both.


7.4.4
3817
ἅμα δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ καθεζόμενος εἰς τὸ μέσον σὺν τῇ στρατιᾷ ἐκάλεσεν ἑκατέρων τοὺς ἐπικαιρίους .
At day-break he took his stand with his army between the two and summoned the leaders of the two factions.


7.4.4
3818
οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες ἀλλήλους ἠχθέσθησαν , νομίζοντες ἐξηπατῆσθαι ἀμφότεροι .
And when they saw one another they were indignant, for they both thought they had been duped.


7.4.5
3819
ὁ μέντοι Ἀδούσιος ἔλεξε τοιάδε ·
Adusius, however, addressed them as follows:


7.4.5
3820
ἐγὼ ὑμῖν , ὦ ἄνδρες , ὤμοσα ἀδόλως εἰσιέναι εἰς τὰ τείχη καὶ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ τῶν δεχομένων .
Gentlemen, I gave you my oath that I would without treachery enter your walls for the advantage of those who admitted me.


7.4.5
3821
εἰ μὲν οὖν ἀπολῶ ὁποτέρους ὑμῶν , νομίζω ἐπὶ κακῷ εἰσεληλυθέναι Καρῶν ·
If, therefore, I destroy either party of you, I think that I have come in to the injury of the Carians;


7.4.5
3822
ἢν δὲ εἰρήνην ὑμῖν ποιήσω καὶ ἀσφάλειαν ἐργάζεσθαι ἀμφοτέροις τὴν γῆν , νομίζω ὑμῖν ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ παρεῖναι .
whereas, if I can secure peace for you and security for all to till the fields, I think I am here for your advantage.


7.4.5
3823
νῦν οὖν χρὴ ἀπὸ τῆσδε τῆς ἡμέρας ἐπιμίγνυσθαί τε ἀλλήλοις φιλικῶς , ἐργάζεσθαί τε τὴν γῆν ἀδεῶς , διδόναι τε τέκνα καὶ λαμβάνειν παρ’ ἀλλήλων .
Now, therefore, from this day you must live together like friends, till your lands without fear of one another, and intermarry your children one party with the other;


7.4.5
3824
ἢν δὲ παρὰ ταῦτα ἀδικεῖν τις ἐπιχειρῇ , τούτοις Κῦρός τε καὶ ἡμεῖς πολέμιοι ἐσόμεθα .
and if any one in defiance of these regulations attempts to make trouble, Cyrus, and we with him, will be that man’s enemies.


7.4.6
3825
ἐκ τούτου πύλαι μὲν ἀνεῳγμέναι ἦσαν τῶν τειχῶν , μεσταὶ δὲ αἱ ὁδοὶ πορευομένων παρ’ ἀλλήλους , μεστοὶ δὲ οἱ χῶροι ἐργαζομένων ·
After that, the gates of the city were opened, the streets filled up with people passing to and fro, and the farms with labourers;


7.4.6
3826
ἑορτὰς δὲ κοινῇ ἦγον , εἰρήνης δὲ καὶ εὐφροσύνης πάντα πλέα ἦν .
they celebrated their festivals together, and peace and joy reigned everywhere.


7.4.7
3827
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ ἧκον παρὰ Κύρου ἐρωτῶντες εἴ τι στρατιᾶς προσδέοιτο ἢ μηχανημάτων ·
At this juncture messengers came to him from Cyrus to ask if he needed any more troops or engines;


7.4.7
3828
ὁ δὲ Ἀδούσιος ἀπεκρίνατο ὅτι καὶ τῇ παρούσῃ ἐξείη ἄλλοσε χρῆσθαι στρατιᾷ ·
but Adusius answered that even the army he had with him was at the disposal of Cyrus to employ elsewhere.


7.4.7
3829
καὶ ἅμα ταῦτα λέγων ἀπῆγε τὸ στράτευμα , φρουροὺς ἐν ταῖς ἄκραις καταλιπών .
And with those words he started to lead back his army, leaving only garrisons upon the citadels.


7.4.7
3830
οἱ δὲ Κᾶρες ἱκέτευον μένειν αὐτόν ·
But the Carians pleaded with him to stay;


7.4.7
3831
ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐκ ἤθελε , προσέπεμψαν πρὸς Κῦρον δεόμενοι πέμψαι Ἀδούσιον σφίσι σατράπην .
and when he refused, they sent to Cyrus to petition him to send Adusius to be their satrap.


7.4.8
3832
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐν τούτῳ ἀπεστάλκει Ὑστάσπαν στράτευμα ἄγοντα ἐπὶ Φρυγίαν τὴν περὶ Ἑλλήσποντον .
Cyrus had meanwhile sent off Hystaspas in command of an expedition against the Phrygia that lies along the Hellespont.


7.4.8
3833
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἧκεν ὁ Ἀδούσιος , μετάγειν αὐτὸν ἐκέλευσεν ᾗπερ ὁ Ὑστάσπας προῴχετο , ὅπως μᾶλλον πείθοιντο τῷ Ὑστάσπᾳ , ἀκούσαντες ἄλλο στράτευμα προσιόν .
So when Adusius returned, he directed him to march on in the direction Hystaspas had taken, that they might submit to Hystaspas more readily when they heard that another army was on the way.


7.4.9
3834
οἱ μὲν οὖν Ἕλληνες οἱ ἐπὶ θαλάττῃ οἰκοῦντες πολλὰ δῶρα δόντες διεπράξαντο ὥστε εἰς μὲν τὰ τείχη βαρβάρους μὴ δέχεσθαι , δασμὸν δὲ ἀποφέρειν καὶ στρατεύειν ὅποι Κῦρος ἐπαγγέλλοι .
Now the Greeks who dwelt by the sea gave many gifts and secured an agreement to the effect that while they should not receive the barbarians within their walls, they would yet pay tribute and serve under him in the field wherever Cyrus  should direct.


7.4.10
3835
ὁ δὲ τῶν Φρυγῶν βασιλεὺς παρεσκευάζετο μὲν ὡς καθέξων τὰ ἐρυμνὰ καὶ οὐ πεισόμενος καὶ παρήγγελλεν οὕτως ·
But the king of Phrygia made preparations to keep possession of his forts and not to submit, and he gave orders to that effect.


7.4.10
3836
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀφίσταντο αὐτοῦ οἱ ὕπαρχοι καὶ ἔρημος ἐγίγνετο , τελευτῶν εἰς χεῖρας ἦλθεν Ὑστάσπᾳ ἐπὶ τῇ Κύρου δίκῃ .
When, however, his subordinate officers deserted and he was left alone, he finally surrendered to Hystaspas on condition that Cyrus should be his judge and arbiter.


7.4.10
3837
καὶ ὁ Ὑστάσπας καταλιπὼν ἐν ταῖς ἄκραις ἰσχυρὰς Περσῶν φρουρὰς ἀπῄει ἄγων σὺν τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ καὶ Φρυγῶν πολλοὺς ἱππέας καὶ πελταστάς .
And Hystaspas, leaving strong garrisons of Persians upon the citadels, went back with his own army reinforced with many Phrygian horsemen and peltasts.


7.4.11
3838
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐπέστελλεν Ἀδουσίῳ συμμείξαντα πρὸς Ὑστάσπαν τοὺς μὲν ἑλομένους Φρυγῶν τὰ σφέτερα σὺν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἄγειν , τοὺς δὲ ἐπιθυμήσαντας πολεμεῖν τούτων ἀφελομένους τοὺς ἵππους καὶ τὰ ὅπλα σφενδόνας ἔχοντας πάντας κελεύειν ἕπεσθαι .
Besides, Cyrus  had given Adusius instructions to join Hystaspas and bring with them armed those Phrygians who had voluntarily taken their side, but to take their horses and arms away from those who had shown fight, and to make all such follow, armed with nothing but slings.


7.4.12
3839
οὗτοι μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἐποίουν .
Accordingly, they were thus engaged in executing these orders.


7.4.12
3840
Κῦρος δὲ ὡρμᾶτο ἐκ Σάρδεων , φρουρὰν μὲν πεζὴν καταλιπὼν πολλὴν ἐν Σάρδεσι , Κροῖσον δὲ ἔχων , ἄγων δὲ πολλὰς ἁμάξας πολλῶν καὶ παντοδαπῶν χρημάτων .
But Cyrus, leaving behind a large garrison of foot-soldiers, started from Sardis in company with Croesus; and he took with him many wagons loaded with valuables of every sort.


7.4.12
3841
ἧκε δὲ καὶ ὁ Κροῖσος γεγραμμένα ἔχων ἀκριβῶς ὅσα ἐν ἑκάστῃ ἦν τῇ ἁμάξῃ ·
And Croesus also had come with an accurate inventory of what was in each wagon;


7.4.12
3842
καὶ διδοὺς τῷ Κύρῳ τὰ γράμματα εἶπε ·
and as he handed the lists to Cyrus he said:


7.4.12
3843
ταῦτ’ , ἔφη , ἔχων , ὦ Κῦρε , εἴσῃ τόν τέ σοι ὀρθῶς ἀποδιδόντα ἃ ἄγει καὶ τὸν μή .
From this, Cyrus, you may know who renders to you in full that of which he has charge and who does not.


7.4.13
3844
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἔλεξεν ·
Aye, Croesus, answered Cyrus;


7.4.13
3845
ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν καλῶς ποιεῖς , ὦ Κροῖσε , προνοῶν ·
you do well to take this precaution.


7.4.13
3846
ἔμοιγε μέντοι ἄξουσι τὰ χρήματα οἵπερ καὶ ἔχειν αὐτὰ ἄξιοί εἰσιν ·
As far as I am concerned, however, those shall have charge of the valuables who also deserve to own them;


7.4.13
3847
ὥστε ἤν τι καὶ κλέψωσι , τῶν ἑαυτῶν κλέψονται .
so that if they embezzle anything, they will be embezzling from what is their own.


7.4.13
3848
καὶ ἅμα ταῦτα λέγων ἔδωκε τὰ γράμματα τοῖς φίλοις καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν , ὅπως εἰδεῖεν τῶν ἐπιτρόπων οἵ τε σῶα αὐτοῖς ἀποδιδοῖεν οἵ τε μή .
With these words, he gave the inventories to his friends and officers, that they might be able to tell who of the overseers delivered everything safe and who of them failed.


7.4.14
3849
ἦγε δὲ καὶ Λυδῶν οὓς μὲν ἑώρα καλλωπιζομένους καὶ ὅπλοις καὶ ἵπποις καὶ ἅρμασι καὶ πάντα πειρωμένους ποιεῖν ὅ τι ᾤοντο αὐτῷ χαριεῖσθαι , τούτους μὲν σὺν τοῖς ὅπλοις ·
He took with him also such of the Lydians as he saw taking a pride in the fine appearance of their arms and horses and chariots and trying to do everything that they thought would please him; these he permitted to retain their arms.


7.4.14
3850
οὓς δὲ ἑώρα ἀχαρίτως ἑπομένους , τοὺς μὲν ἵππους αὐτῶν παρέδωκε Πέρσαις τοῖς πρώτοις συστρατευομένοις , τὰ δὲ ὅπλα κατέκαυσε ·
But if he saw any following with bad grace, he turned their horses over to those Persians who had been the first to engage in his service; he had their arms burned,


7.4.14
3851
σφενδόνας δὲ καὶ τούτους ἠνάγκασεν ἔχοντας ἕπεσθαι .
and these men, too, he required to follow with nothing but slings.


7.4.15
3852
καὶ πάντας δὲ τοὺς ἀόπλους τῶν ὑποχειρίων γενομένων σφενδονᾶν ἠνάγκαζε μελετᾶν , νομίζων τοῦτο τὸ ὅπλον δουλικώτατον εἶναι ·
And of those who had been made subjects he required all who were unarmed to practise with the sling, for he considered this weapon to be the one most fitting for a slave.


7.4.15
3853
σὺν μὲν γὰρ ἄλλῃ δυνάμει μάλα ἔστιν ἔνθα ἰσχυρῶς ὠφελοῦσι σφενδονῆται παρόντες , αὐτοὶ δὲ καθ’ αὑτοὺς οὐδ’ ἂν οἱ πάντες σφενδονῆται μείνειαν πάνυ ὀλίγους ὁμόσε ἰόντας σὺν ὅπλοις ἀγχεμάχοις .
For in conjunction with other forces there are occasions when the presence of slingers is of very effective assistance, but by themselves alone not all the slingers in the world could stand against a very few men who came into a hand-to-hand encounter with them with weapons suited for close combat.


7.4.16
3854
προϊὼν δὲ τὴν ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνος κατεστρέψατο μὲν Φρύγας τοὺς ἐν τῇ μεγάλῃ Φρυγίᾳ , κατεστρέψατο δὲ Καππαδόκας , ὑποχειρίους δ’ ἐποιήσατο Ἀραβίους .
On the way to Babylon he subdued Greater Phrygia and Cappadocia and reduced the Arabians to submission.


7.4.16
3855
ἐξώπλισε δὲ ἀπὸ πάντων τούτων Περσῶν μὲν ἱππέας οὐ μεῖον τετρακισμυρίους , πολλοὺς δὲ ἵππους τῶν αἰχμαλώτων καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς συμμάχοις διέδωκε ·
From all these he secured armour for not less than forty thousand Persian horsemen, and many horses taken from the prisoners he distributed among all the divisions of his allies.


7.4.16
3856
καὶ πρὸς Βαβυλῶνα ἀφίκετο παμπόλλους μὲν ἱππέας ἔχων , παμπόλλους δὲ τοξότας καὶ ἀκοντιστάς , σφενδονήτας δὲ ἀναριθμήτους .
And thus he arrived before Babylon with a great host of cavalry, and a great host of bowmen and spearmen, and a multitude of slingers that was beyond number.


7.5.1
3857
ἐπεὶ δὲ πρὸς Βαβυλῶνι ἦν ὁ Κῦρος , περιέστησε μὲν πᾶν τὸ στράτευμα περὶ τὴν πόλιν , ἔπειτα αὐτὸς περιήλαυνε τὴν πόλιν σὺν τοῖς φίλοις τε καὶ ἐπικαιρίοις τῶν συμμάχων .
When Cyrus  appeared before Babylon  he stationed his whole force about the city and then rode around it himself in company with his friends and the staff-officers of the allies;


7.5.2
3858
ἐπεὶ δὲ κατεθεάσατο τὰ τείχη , ἀπάγειν παρεσκευάσατο τὴν στρατιὰν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ·
But when he had taken a survey of the walls, he prepared to draw off his army from the city.


7.5.2
3859
ἐξελθὼν δέ τις αὐτόμολος εἶπεν ὅτι ἐπιτίθεσθαι μέλλοιεν αὐτῷ , ὁπότε ἀπάγοι τὸ στράτευμα ·
But a deserter came out and told him that they were going to attack him as soon as he began to draw his army off.


7.5.2
3860
καταθεωμένοις γάρ , ἔφη , αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ἀσθενὴς ἐδόκει εἶναι ἡ φάλαγξ ·
For, the man went on, your lines looked weak to those who observed them from the walls.


7.5.2
3861
καὶ οὐδὲν θαυμαστὸν ἦν οὕτως ἔχειν ·
And it was no wonder that they appeared so;


7.5.2
3862
περὶ γὰρ πολὺ τεῖχος κυκλουμένοις ἀνάγκη ἦν ἐπ’ ὀλίγων τὸ βάθος γενέσθαι τὴν φάλαγγα .
for, encompassing walls of such extent, the lines necessarily had but little depth.


7.5.3
3863
ἀκούσας οὖν ὁ Κῦρος ταῦτα , στὰς κατὰ μέσον τῆς αὑτοῦ στρατιᾶς σὺν τοῖς περὶ αὐτὸν παρήγγειλεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἄκρου ἑκατέρωθεν τοὺς ὁπλίτας ἀναπτύσσοντας τὴν φάλαγγα ἀπιέναι παρὰ τὸ ἑστηκὸς τοῦ στρατεύματος , ἕως γένοιτο ἑκατέρωθεν τὸ ἄκρον κατ’ αὐτὸν καὶ κατὰ τὸ μέσον .
On hearing this, therefore, Cyrus  took his place with his body-guard in the centre of his army and gave orders that the hoplites should fold back the phalanx from the extremity of either wing and move toward each other behind the main body, which had been halted, until each of the extreme wings should meet in a line with him, that is, in the centre.


7.5.4
3864
οὕτως οὖν ποιούντων οἵ τε μένοντες εὐθὺς θαρραλεώτεροι ἐγίγνοντο ἐπὶ διπλασίων τὸ βάθος γιγνόμενοι , οἵ τ’ ἀπιόντες ὡσαύτως θαρραλεώτεροι ·
By this manoeuvre the men that remained standing in their places were at once given more courage, for the depth of the line was thus doubled; and those who had fallen back were likewise rendered more courageous;


7.5.4
3865
εὐθὺς γὰρ οἱ μένοντες ἀντ’ αὐτῶν πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους ἐγίγνοντο .
for thus those troops which had been kept standing had now come to face the enemy, and not they.


7.5.4
3866
ἐπεὶ δὲ πορευόμενοι ἑκατέρωθεν συνῆψαν τὰ ἄκρα , ἔστησαν ἰσχυρότεροι γεγενημένοι , οἵ τε ἀπεληλυθότες διὰ τοὺς ἔμπροσθεν , οἵ τ’ ἔμπροσθεν διὰ τοὺς ὄπισθεν προσγεγενημένους .
But when, as they marched in from both sides, the ends came together, they stood thus mutually strengthened — those who had shifted their position were supported by those in front of them, those in front by the men behind them.


7.5.5
3867
ἀναπτυχθείσης δ’ οὕτω τῆς φάλαγγος ἀνάγκη τοὺς πρώτους ἀρίστους εἶναι καὶ τοὺς τελευταίους , ἐν μέσῳ δὲ τοὺς κακίστους τετάχθαι ·
And when the phalanx was thus folded back, the front ranks and the rear were of necessity composed of the most valiant men and the poorest were drawn up between them.


7.5.5
3868
ἡ δ’ οὕτως ἔχουσα τάξις καὶ πρὸς τὸ μάχεσθαι ἐδόκει εὖ παρεσκευάσθαι καὶ πρὸς τὸ μὴ φεύγειν .
And this arrangement of the lines seemed well adapted both for fighting and for keeping the men from flight;


7.5.5
3869
καὶ οἱ ἱππεῖς δὲ καὶ οἱ γυμνῆτες οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν κεράτων αἰεὶ ἐγγύτερον ἐγίγνοντο τοῦ ἄρχοντος τοσούτῳ ὅσῳ ἡ φάλαγξ βραχυτέρα ἐγίγνετο ἀναδιπλουμένη .
and the cavalry and the light-armed troops upon the wings were in each case brought as much nearer to the commander as the phalanx was shorter when doubled.


7.5.6
3870
ἐπεὶ δὲ οὕτω συνεσπειράθησαν , ἀπῇσαν , ἕως μὲν ἐξικνεῖτο τὰ βέλη ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους , ἐπὶ πόδα ·
And when they had thus closed up, they retired backward as long as they were within range of the missiles from the wall;


7.5.6
3871
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἔξω βελῶν ἐγένοντο , στραφέντες , καὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ὀλίγα βήματα προϊόντες μετεβάλοντο ἐπ’ ἀσπίδα καὶ ἵσταντο πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος βλέποντες ·
but when they were out of range, they would face about and go forward at first only a few steps and wheel to the left and stand facing the wall;


7.5.6
3872
ὅσῳ δὲ προσωτέρω ἐγίγνοντο , τόσῳ δὲ μανότερον μετεβάλλοντο .
and the further off they got, the less often did they thus wheel around;


7.5.6
3873
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐν τῷ ἀσφαλεῖ ἐδόκουν εἶναι , ξυνεῖρον ἀπιόντες , ἔστ’ ἐπὶ ταῖς σκηναῖς ἐγένοντο .
and when they seemed to be out of all danger, they marched off without stopping until they arrived at their tents.


7.5.7
3874
ἐπεὶ δὲ κατεστρατοπεδεύσαντο , συνεκάλεσεν ὁ Κῦρος τοὺς ἐπικαιρίους καὶ ἔλεξεν ·
When they had encamped, Cyrus called together his staff-officers and said:


7.5.7
3875
ἄνδρες σύμμαχοι , τεθεάμεθα μὲν κύκλῳ τὴν πόλιν ·
Friends and allies, we have viewed the city on every side.


7.5.7
3876
ἐγὼ δὲ ὅπως μὲν ἄν τις τείχη οὕτως μὲν κύκλῳ τὴν πόλιν ·
But I am sure I cannot see how any one could take by storm walls so massive and so high;


7.5.7
3877
ἐγὼ δὲ ὅπως μὲν ἄν τις τείχη οὕτως ὅσῳ δὲ πλέονες ἄνθρωποι ἐν τῇ πόλει εἰσίν , ἐπείπερ οὐ μάχονται ἐξιόντες , τοσούτῳ ἂν θᾶττον λιμῷ αὐτοὺς ἡγοῦμαι ἁλῶναι .
but the more men there are in the city, the sooner they can, I think, be brought by famine to capitulate, seeing that they will not come out and fight.


7.5.7
3878
εἰ μή τιν’ οὖν ἄλλον τρόπον ἔχετε λέγειν , τούτῳ πολιορκητέους φημὶ εἶναι τοὺς ἄνδρας .
Therefore, unless you have some other method to suggest, I propose that we use this method of laying siege to those gentlemen.


7.5.8
3879
καὶ ὁ Χρυσάντας εἶπεν ·
But said Chrysantas,


7.5.8
3880
ὁ δὲ ποταμός , ἔφη , οὗτος οὐ διὰ μέσης τῆς πόλεως ῥεῖ πλάτος ἔχων πλέον ἢ ἐπὶ δύο στάδια ;
does not this river flow through the midst of the city? And it is more than two stadia in width.


7.5.8
3881
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , καὶ βάθος γ’ ὡς οὐδ’ ἂν δύο ἄνδρες ὁ ἕτερος ἐπὶ τοῦ ἑτέρου ἑστηκὼς τοῦ ὕδατος ὑπερέχοιεν ·
Aye, by Zeus, said Gobryas, and its depth is such that two men, one standing on the other’s shoulders, would not reach the surface of the water,


7.5.8
3882
ὥστε τῷ ποταμῷ ἔτι ἰσχυροτέρα ἐστὶν ἡ πόλις ἢ τοῖς τείχεσι .
so that the city is better defended by the river than by its walls.


7.5.9
3883
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος , ταῦτα μέν , ἔφη , ὦ Χρυσάντα , ἐῶμεν ὅσα κρείττω ἐστὶ τῆς ἡμετέρας δυνάμεως ·
Chrysantas, Cyrus answered, let us not trouble ourselves with that which is beyond our powers;


7.5.9
3884
διαμετρησαμένους δὲ χρὴ ὡς τάχιστα τὸ μέρος ἑκάστους ἡμῶν ὀρύττειν τάφρον ὡς πλατυτάτην καὶ βαθυτάτην , ὅπως ὅτι ἐλαχίστων ἡμῖν τῶν φυλάκων δέῃ .
but we must apportion the work among ourselves as quickly as possible, to each contingent its proper share, and dig a ditch as wide and as deep as possible, so that we may require only as many men on guard as are absolutely indispensable.


7.5.10
3885
οὕτω δὴ κύκλῳ διαμετρήσας περὶ τὸ τεῖχος , ἀπολιπὼν ὅσον τύρσεσι μεγάλαις ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ , ὤρυττεν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν τοῦ τείχους τάφρον ὑπερμεγέθη , καὶ τὴν γῆν ἀνέβαλλον πρὸς ἑαυτούς .
Accordingly, he took measurements in a circle round about the city, leaving just enough room by the river for the erection of large towers, and began on either side of the city to dig an immense trench; and the earth from it they threw up on their own side of the ditch.


7.5.11
3886
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν πύργους ἐπὶ τῷ ποταμῷ ᾠκοδόμει , φοίνιξι θεμελιώσας οὐ μεῖον ἢ πλεθριαίοις ( εἰσὶ γὰρ καὶ μείζονες ἢ τοσοῦτοι τὸ μῆκος πεφυκότες ) ·
First of all, he began to build towers by the river, laying his foundations with the trunks of date-palms not less than a hundred feet long — and they grow even taller than that.


7.5.11
3887
καὶ γὰρ δὴ πιεζόμενοι οἱ φοίνικες ὑπὸ βάρους ἄνω κυρτοῦνται , ὥσπερ οἱ ὄνοι οἱ κανθήλιοι ·
And they were good material for this purpose, for it is a well known fact that date-palms, when under heavy pressure, bend upward like the backs of pack-asses.


7.5.12
3888
τούτους δ’ ὑπετίθει τούτου ἕνεκα ὅπως ὅτι μάλιστα ἐοίκοι πολιορκήσειν παρασκευαζομένῳ , ὡς εἰ καὶ διαφύγοι ὁ ποταμὸς εἰς τὴν τάφρον , μὴ ἀνέλοι τοὺς πύργους .
These he used as mud-sills, in order that, even if the river should break into his trench above, it might not carry his towers away.


7.5.12
3889
ἀνίστη δὲ καὶ ἄλλους πολλοὺς πύργους ἐπὶ τῆς ἀμβολάδος γῆς , ὅπως ὅτι πλεῖστα φυλακτήρια εἴη .
And he erected many other towers besides upon the breast-works of earth, so that he might have as many watch-towers as possible.


7.5.13
3890
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἐποίουν ·
Thus, then, his men were employed,


7.5.13
3891
οἱ δ’ ἐν τῷ τείχει κατεγέλων τῆς πολιορκίας , ὡς ἔχοντες τὰ ἐπιτήδεια πλέον ἢ εἴκοσιν ἐτῶν .
while the enemy upon the walls laughed his siege-works to scorn, in the belief that they had provisions enough for more than twenty years.


7.5.13
3892
ἀκούσας δὲ ταῦτα ὁ Κῦρος τὸ στράτευμα κατένειμε δώδεκα μέρη , ὡς μῆνα τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἕκαστον τὸ μέρος φυλάξον .
Upon hearing of this, Cyrus divided his army into twelve parts as if intending each part to be responsible for sentry duty during one month of each year;


7.5.14
3893
οἱ δὲ αὖ Βαβυλώνιοι ἀκούσαντες ταῦτα πολὺ ἔτι μᾶλλον κατεγέλων , ἐννοούμενοι εἰ σφᾶς Φρύγες καὶ Λυδοὶ καὶ Ἀράβιοι καὶ Καππαδόκαι φυλάξοιεν , οὓς σφίσιν ἐνόμιζον πάντας εὐμενεστέρους εἶναι ἢ Πέρσαις .
but the Babylonians, in their turn, when they heard of that, laughed much more scornfully still, at the thought of Phrygians and Lydians and Arabians and Cappadocians keeping guard against them, for they considered all these to be more friendly to them than to the Persians.


7.5.15
3894
καὶ αἱ μὲν τάφροι ἤδη ὀρωρυγμέναι ἦσαν .
At last the ditches were completed.


7.5.15
3895
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἐπειδὴ ἑορτὴν τοιαύτην ἐν τῇ Βαβυλῶνι ἤκουσεν εἶναι , ἐν ᾗ πάντες Βαβυλώνιοι ὅλην τὴν νύκτα πίνουσι καὶ κωμάζουσιν , ἐν ταύτῃ , ἐπειδὴ τάχιστα συνεσκότασε , λαβὼν πολλοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἀνεστόμωσε τὰς τάφρους πρὸς τὸν ποταμόν .
Then, when he heard that a certain festival had come round in Babylon, during which all Babylon was accustomed to drink and revel all night long, Cyrus took a large number of men, just as soon as it was dark, and opened up the heads of the trenches at the river.


7.5.16
3896
ὡς δὲ τοῦτο ἐγένετο , τὸ ὕδωρ κατὰ τὰς τάφρους ἐχώρει ἐν τῇ νυκτί , ἡ δὲ διὰ τῆς πόλεως τοῦ ποταμοῦ ὁδὸς πορεύσιμος ἀνθρώποις ἐγίγνετο .
As soon as that was done, the water flowed down through the ditches in the night, and the bed of the river, where it traversed the city, became passable for men.


7.5.17
3897
ὡς δὲ τὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ οὕτως ἐπορσύνετο , παρηγγύησεν ὁ Κῦρος Πέρσαις χιλιάρχοις καὶ πεζῶν καὶ ἱππέων εἰς δύο ἄγοντας τὴν χιλιοστὺν παρεῖναι πρὸς αὐτόν , τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους συμμάχους κατ’ οὐρὰν τούτων ἕπεσθαι ᾗπερ πρόσθεν τεταγμένους .
When the problem of the river was thus solved, Cyrus  gave orders to his Persian colonels, infantry and cavalry, to marshal their regiments two abreast and come to him, and the rest, the allies, to follow in their rear, drawn up as before.


7.5.18
3898
οἱ μὲν δὴ παρῆσαν ·
They came, according to orders,


7.5.18
3899
ὁ δὲ καταβιβάσας εἰς τὸ ξηρὸν τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοὺς ὑπηρέτας καὶ πεζοὺς καὶ ἱππέας , ἐκέλευσε σκέψασθαι εἰ πορεύσιμον εἴη τὸ ἔδαφος τοῦ ποταμοῦ .
and he bade his aides, both foot and horse, get into the dry channel of the river and see if it was possible to march in the bed of the river.


7.5.19
3900
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀπήγγειλαν ὅτι πορεύσιμον εἴη , ἐνταῦθα δὴ συγκαλέσας τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τῶν πεζῶν καὶ ἱππέων ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
And when they brought back word that it was, he called together the generals of both infantry and cavalry and spoke as follows:


7.5.20
3901
ἄνδρες , ἔφη , φίλοι , ὁ μὲν ποταμὸς ἡμῖν παρακεχώρηκε τῆς εἰς τὴν πόλιν ὁδοῦ .
My friends, said he, the river has made way for us and given us an entrance into the city.


7.5.20
3902
ἡμεῖς δὲ θαρροῦντες εἰσίωμεν μηδὲν φοβούμενοι εἴσω , ἐννοούμενοι ὅτι οὗτοι ἐφ’ οὓς νῦν πορευσόμεθα ἐκεῖνοί εἰσιν οὓς ἡμεῖς καὶ συμμάχους πρὸς ἑαυτοῖς ἔχοντας καὶ ἐγρηγορότας ἅπαντας καὶ νήφοντας καὶ ἐξωπλισμένους καὶ συντεταγμένους ἐνικῶμεν ·
Let us, therefore, enter in with dauntless hearts, fearing nothing and remembering that those against whom we are now to march are the same men that we have repeatedly defeated, and that, too, when they were all drawn up in battle line with their allies at their side, and when they were all wide awake and sober and fully armed;


7.5.21
3903
νῦν δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἴμεν ἐν ᾧ πολλοὶ μὲν αὐτῶν καθεύδουσι , πολλοὶ δ’ αὐτῶν μεθύουσι , πάντες δ’ ἀσύντακτοί εἰσιν ·
whereas now we are going to fall upon them at a time when many of them are asleep, many drunk, and none of them in battle array.


7.5.21
3904
ὅταν δὲ αἴσθωνται ἡμᾶς ἔνδον ὄντας , πολὺ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἢ νῦν ἀχρεῖοι ἔσονται ὑπὸ τοῦ ἐκπεπλῆχθαι .
And when they find out that we are inside the walls, in their panic fright they will be much more helpless still than they are now.


7.5.22
3905
εἰ δέ τις τοῦτο ἐννοεῖται , ὃ δὴ λέγεται φοβερὸν εἶναι τοῖς εἰς πόλιν εἰσιοῦσι , μὴ ἐπὶ τὰ τέγη ἀναβάντες βάλλωσιν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν , τοῦτο μάλιστα θαρρεῖτε ·
But if any one is apprehensive of that which is said to be a source of terror to those invading a city — namely, that the people may go up on the house-tops and hurl down missiles right and left, you need not be in the least afraid of that;


7.5.22
3906
ἢν γὰρ ἀναβῶσί τινες ἐπὶ τὰς οἰκίας , ἔχομεν σύμμαχον θεὸν Ἥφαιστον .
for if any do go up upon their houses, we have a god on our side, Hephaestus.


7.5.22
3907
εὔφλεκτα δὲ τὰ πρόθυρα αὐτῶν , φοίνικος μὲν αἱ θύραι πεποιημέναι , ἀσφάλτῳ δὲ ὑπεκκαύματι κεχριμέναι .
And their porticoes are very inflammable, for the doors are made of palm-wood and covered with bituminous varnish which will burn like tinder;


7.5.23
3908
ἡμεῖς δ’ αὖ πολλὴν μὲν δᾷδα ἔχομεν , ἣ ταχὺ πολὺ πῦρ τέξεται , πολλὴν δὲ πίτταν καὶ στυππεῖον , ἃ ταχὺ παρακαλεῖ πολλὴν φλόγα ·
while we, on our side, have plenty of pine-wood for torches, which will quickly produce a mighty conflagration; we have also plenty of pitch and tow, which will quickly spread the flames everywhere,


7.5.23
3909
ὥστε ἀνάγκην εἶναι ἢ φεύγειν ταχὺ τοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν οἰκιῶν ἢ ταχὺ κατακεκαῦσθαι .
so that those upon the house-tops must either quickly leave their posts or quickly be consumed.


7.5.24
3910
ἀλλ’ ἄγετε λαμβάνετε τὰ ὅπλα ·
But come, to arms!


7.5.24
3911
ἡγήσομαι δ’ ἐγὼ σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς .
and with the help of the gods I will lead you on.


7.5.24
3912
ὑμεῖς δ’ , ἔφη , ὦ Γαδάτα καὶ Γωβρύα , δείκνυτε τὰς ὁδούς ·
And do you, Gadatas and Gobryas, show the streets,


7.5.24
3913
ἴστε γάρ ·
for you are familiar with them.


7.5.24
3914
ὅταν δ’ ἐντὸς γενώμεθα , τὴν ταχίστην ἄγετε ἐπὶ τὰ βασίλεια .
And when we get inside the walls, lead us by the quickest route to the royal palace.


7.5.25
3915
καὶ μήν , ἔφασαν οἱ ἀμφὶ τὸν Γωβρύαν , οὐδὲν ἂν εἴη θαυμαστὸν εἰ καὶ ἄκλειστοι αἱ πύλαι αἱ τοῦ βασιλείου εἶεν ·
Aye, answered Gobryas and his staff, in view of the revelry, it would not be at all surprising if the gates leading to the palace were open,


7.5.25
3916
κωμάζει γὰρ ἡ πόλις πᾶσα τῇδε τῇ νυκτί .
for all the city is feasting this night.


7.5.25
3917
φυλακῇ μέντοι πρὸ τῶν πυλῶν ἐντευξόμεθα ·
Still, we shall find a guard before the gates, for one is always posted there.


7.5.25
3918
ἔστι γὰρ αἰεὶ τεταγμένη .
We must lose no time, then, said Cyrus.


7.5.25
3919
οὐκ ἂν μέλλειν δέοι , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ἀλλ’ ἰέναι , ἵνα ἀπαρασκεύους ὡς μάλιστα λάβωμεν τοὺς ἄνδρας .
Forward, that we may catch the men as unprepared as we can.


7.5.26
3920
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα ἐρρήθη , ἐπορεύοντο ·
When these words were spoken, they advanced.


7.5.26
3921
τῶν δὲ ἀπαντώντων οἱ μὲν ἀπέθνῃσκον παιόμενοι , οἱ δ’ ἔφευγον πάλιν εἴσω , οἱ δ’ ἐβόων ·
And of those they met on the way, some fell by their swords, some fled back into their houses, some shouted to them;


7.5.26
3922
οἱ δ’ ἀμφὶ τὸν Γωβρύαν συνεβόων αὐτοῖς , ὡς κωμασταὶ ὄντες καὶ αὐτοί ·
and Gobryas and his men shouted back to them, as if they were fellow-revellers.


7.5.26
3923
καὶ ἰόντες ᾗ ἐδύναντο ὡς τάχιστα ἐπὶ τοῖς βασιλείοις ἐγένοντο .
They advanced as fast as they could and were soon at the palace.


7.5.27
3924
καὶ οἱ μὲν σὺν τῷ Γωβρύᾳ καὶ Γαδάτᾳ τεταγμένοι κεκλειμένας εὑρίσκουσι τὰς πύλας τοῦ βασιλείου ·
And Gobryas and Gadatas and their troops found the gates leading to the palace locked,


7.5.27
3925
οἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τοὺς φύλακας ταχθέντες ἐπεισπίπτουσιν αὐτοῖς πίνουσι πρὸς φῶς πολύ , καὶ εὐθὺς ὡς πολεμίοις ἐχρῶντο αὐτοῖς .
and those who had been appointed to attack the guard fell upon them as they were drinking by a blazing fire, and without waiting they dealt with them as with foes.


7.5.28
3926
ὡς δὲ κραυγὴ καὶ κτύπος ἐγίγνετο , αἰσθόμενοι οἱ ἔνδον τοῦ θορύβου , κελεύσαντος τοῦ βασιλέως σκέψασθαι τί εἴη τὸ πρᾶγμα , ἐκθέουσί τινες ἀνοίξαντες τὰς πύλας .
But, as a noise and tumult ensued, those within heard the uproar, and at the king’s command to see what the matter was, some of them opened the gates and ran out.


7.5.29
3927
οἱ δ’ ἀμφὶ τὸν Γαδάταν ὡς εἶδον τὰς πύλας χαλώσας εἰσπίπτουσι καὶ τοῖς πάλιν φεύγουσιν εἴσω ἐφεπόμενοι καὶ παίοντες ἀφικνοῦνται πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ·
And when Gadatas and his men saw the gates open they dashed in in pursuit of the others as they fled back into the palace, and dealing blows right and left they came into the presence of the king;


7.5.29
3928
καὶ ἤδη ἑστηκότα αὐτὸν καὶ ἐσπασμένον ὃν εἶχεν ἀκινάκην εὑρίσκουσι .
and they found him already risen with his dagger in his hand.


7.5.30
3929
καὶ τοῦτον μὲν οἱ σὺν Γαδάτᾳ καὶ Γωβρύᾳ ἐχειροῦντο ·
And Gadatas and Gobryas and their followers overpowered him;


7.5.30
3930
καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ δὲ ἀπέθνῃσκον , ὁ μὲν προβαλλόμενός τι , ὁ δὲ φεύγων , ὁ δέ γε καὶ ἀμυνόμενος ὅτῳ ἐδύνατο .
and those about the king perished also, one where he had sought some shelter, another while running away, another while actually trying to defend himself with whatever he could.


7.5.31
3931
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος διέπεμπε τὰς τῶν ἱππέων τάξεις κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ προεῖπεν οὓς μὲν ἔξω λαμβάνοιεν κατακαίνειν , τοὺς δ’ ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις κηρύττειν τοὺς συριστὶ ἐπισταμένους ἔνδον μένειν ·
Cyrus then sent the companies of cavalry around through the streets and gave them orders to cut down all whom they found out of doors,


7.5.31
3932
εἰ δέ τις ἔξω ληφθείη , ὅτι θανατώσοιτο .
while he directed those who understood Assyrian to proclaim to those in their houses that they should stay there, for if any one should be caught outside, he would be put to death.


7.5.32
3933
οἱ μὲν δὴ ταῦτ’ ἐποίουν .
While they were thus occupied,


7.5.32
3934
Γαδάτας δὲ καὶ Γωβρύας ἧκον ·
Gadatas and Gobryas came up;


7.5.32
3935
καὶ θεοὺς μὲν πρῶτον προσεκύνουν , ὅτι τετιμωρημένοι ἦσαν τὸν ἀνόσιον βασιλέα , ἔπειτα δὲ Κύρου κατεφίλουν καὶ χεῖρας καὶ πόδας , πολλὰ δακρύοντες ἅμα χαρᾷ καὶ εὐφραινόμενοι .
and first of all they did homage to the gods, seeing that they had avenged themselves upon the wicked king, and then they kissed Cyrus’s hands and his feet with many tears of joy.


7.5.33
3936
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἡμέρα ἐγένετο καὶ ᾔσθοντο οἱ τὰς ἄκρας ἔχοντες ἑαλωκυῖάν τε τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα τεθνηκότα , παραδιδόασι καὶ τὰς ἄκρας .
And when day dawned and those in possession of the citadels discovered that the city was taken and the king slain, they surrendered the citadels, too.


7.5.34
3937
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τὰς μὲν ἄκρας εὐθὺς παρελάμβανε καὶ φρουράρχους τε καὶ φρουροὺς εἰς ταύτας ἀνέπεμπε , τοὺς δὲ τεθνηκότας θάπτειν ἐφῆκε τοῖς προσήκουσι ·
And Cyrus at once took possession of the citadels and sent up to them guards and officers of the guards.


7.5.34
3938
τοὺς δὲ κήρυκας κηρύττειν ἐκέλευεν ἀποφέρειν πάντας τὰ ὅπλα Βαβυλωνίους ·
As for the dead, he gave their relatives permission to bury them.


7.5.34
3939
ὅπου δὲ ληφθήσοιτο ὅπλα ἐν οἰκίᾳ , προηγόρευεν ὡς πάντες οἱ ἔνδον ἀποθανοῖντο .
He furthermore ordered the heralds to make proclamation that all Babylonians deliver up their arms;


7.5.34
3940
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἀπέφερον , ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ταῦτα μὲν εἰς τὰς ἄκρας κατέθετο , ὡς εἴη ἕτοιμα , εἴ τί ποτε δέοι χρῆσθαι .
and he ordered that wherever arms should be found in any house, all the occupants should be put to the sword. So they delivered up their arms and Cyrus stored them in the citadels, so that they might be ready if he ever needed them for use.


7.5.35
3941
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτ’ ἐπέπρακτο , πρῶτον μὲν τοὺς μάγους καλέσας , ὡς δοριαλώτου τῆς πόλεως οὔσης ἀκροθίνια τοῖς θεοῖς καὶ τεμένη ἐκέλευσεν ἐξελεῖν ·
When all this was finished, he first called the magi and requested them, inasmuch as the city had been taken by the sword, to select sanctuaries and the first fruits of the booty for the gods.


7.5.35
3942
ἐκ τούτου δὲ καὶ οἰκίας διεδίδου καὶ ἀρχεῖα τούτοις οὕσπερ κοινῶνας ἐνόμιζε τῶν καταπεπραγμένων ·
Next he distributed the private houses and official residences among those whom he considered to have had a share in what had been achieved;


7.5.35
3943
οὕτω δὲ διένειμεν , ὥσπερ ἐδέδοκτο , τὰ κράτιστα τοῖς ἀρίστοις .
and he made the division in the way that had been decided upon — the best to the most meritorious.


7.5.35
3944
εἰ δέ τις οἴοιτο μεῖον ἔχειν , διδάσκειν προσιόντας ἐκέλευε .
And if any one thought he had less than he should, he bade him come and explain his reasons for thinking so.


7.5.36
3945
προεῖπε δὲ Βαβυλωνίοις μὲν τὴν γῆν ἐργάζεσθαι καὶ τοὺς δασμοὺς ἀποφέρειν καὶ θεραπεύειν τούτους οἷς ἕκαστοι αὐτῶν ἐδόθησαν ·
He ordered the Babylonians, moreover, to go on tilling their lands, to pay their tribute, and to serve those to whom they had severally been assigned;


7.5.36
3946
Πέρσας δὲ τοὺς κοινῶνας καὶ τῶν συμμάχων ὅσοι μένειν ᾑροῦντο παρ’ αὐτῷ ὡς δεσπότας ὧν ἔλαβον προηγόρευε διαλέγεσθαι .
and he directed the Persians who had shared in the expedition and as many of the allies as chose to remain with him to address those who had fallen to their share as a master would his servants.


7.5.37
3947
ἐκ δὲ τούτου ἐπιθυμῶν ὁ Κῦρος ἤδη κατασκευάσασθαι καὶ αὐτὸς ὡς βασιλεῖ ἡγεῖτο πρέπειν , ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ τοῦτο σὺν τῇ τῶν φίλων γνώμῃ ποιῆσαι , ὡς ὅτι ἥκιστα ἂν ἐπιφθόνως σπάνιός τε καὶ σεμνὸς φανείη .
After this, Cyrus conceived a desire to establish himself as he thought became a king, but he decided to do it with the approval of his friends, in such a way that his public appearances should be rare and solemn and yet excite as little jealousy as possible.


7.5.37
3948
ὧδε οὖν ἐμηχανᾶτο τοῦτο .
So he adopted the following plan:


7.5.37
3949
ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ στὰς ὅπου ἐδόκει ἐπιτήδειον εἶναι προσεδέχετο τὸν βουλόμενον λέγειν τι καὶ ἀποκρινάμενος ἀπέπεμπεν .
at day-break he would take his station in a place that seemed to him to be adapted to the purpose and there receive all who had any matter to bring before him, give them an answer, and send them away.


7.5.38
3950
οἱ δ’ ἄνθρωποι ὡς ἔγνωσαν ὅτι προσδέχοιτο , ἧκον ἀμήχανοι τὸ πλῆθος ·
But when people learned that he was holding audience, they came in an unmanageable throng,


7.5.38
3951
καὶ ὠθουμένων περὶ τοῦ προσελθεῖν μηχανή τε πολλὴ καὶ μάχη ἦν .
and as they crowded up to get in there was no end of trickery and contention.


7.5.39
3952
οἱ δὲ ὑπηρέται ὡς ἐδύναντο διακρίναντες προσίεσαν .
And his attendants would admit them, making the best discrimination they could.


7.5.39
3953
ὁπότε δέ τις καὶ τῶν φίλων διωσάμενος τὸν ὄχλον προφανείη , προτείνων ὁ Κῦρος τὴν χεῖρα προσήγετο αὐτοὺς καὶ οὕτως ἔλεγεν ·
But whenever any of his personal friends managed to push their way through the throng and catch his eye, Cyrus would stretch out his hand, draw them up to him, and say:


7.5.39
3954
ἄνδρες φίλοι , περιμένετε , ἕως ἂν τὸν ὄχλον διωσώμεθα ·
Just wait, friends, until we get rid of the crowd,


7.5.39
3955
ἔπειτα δὲ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν συγγενησόμεθα .
and then we will enjoy each other’s company quietly.


7.5.39
3956
οἱ μὲν δὴ φίλοι περιέμενον .
So his friends would wait,


7.5.39
3957
ὁ δ’ ὄχλος πλείων καὶ πλείων ἐπέρρει , ὥστ’ ἔφθασεν ἑσπέρα γενομένη πρὶν τοῖς φίλοις αὐτὸν σχολάσαι καὶ συγγενέσθαι .
but the throng would stream in greater and greater, so that evening would set in before he had leisure to share his friends’ company.


7.5.40
3958
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κῦρος λέγει ·
So Cyrus would say:


7.5.40
3959
ὥρα , ἔφη , ὦ ἄνδρες , νῦν μὲν καιρὸς διαλυθῆναι ·
Gentlemen, it is now time to separate;


7.5.40
3960
αὔριον δὲ πρῲ ἔλθετε ·
come tomorrow morning;


7.5.40
3961
καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ βούλομαι ὑμῖν τι διαλεχθῆναι .
for I, too, have something to talk over with you.


7.5.40
3962
ἀκούσαντες ταῦτα οἱ φίλοι ἄσμενοι ᾤχοντο ἀποθέοντες , δίκην δεδωκότες ὑπὸ πάντων τῶν ἀναγκαίων .
Upon hearing this, his friends gladly departed, running from his presence, for they had paid the penalty for ignoring all the wants of nature.


7.5.40
3963
καὶ τότε μὲν οὕτως ἐκοιμήθησαν .
Thus then they went to rest.


7.5.41
3964
τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ὁ μὲν Κῦρος παρῆν εἰς τὸ αὐτὸ χωρίον , ἀνθρώπων δὲ πολὺ πλέον πλῆθος περιειστήκει βουλομένων προσιέναι , καὶ πολὺ πρότερον ἢ οἱ φίλοι παρῆσαν .
On the following day, Cyrus went to the same place and long before his friends came, there was a much greater crowd of people standing there desiring audience with him.


7.5.41
3965
ὁ οὖν Κῦρος περιστησάμενος τῶν ξυστοφόρων Περσῶν κύκλον μέγαν εἶπε μηδένα παριέναι ἢ τοὺς φίλους τε καὶ ἄρχοντας τῶν Περσῶν τε καὶ τῶν συμμάχων .
So Cyrus stationed a large circle of Persian lancers about him and gave orders that no one should be admitted except his friends and the officers of the Persians and the allies.


7.5.42
3966
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνῆλθον οὗτοι , ἔλεξεν ὁ Κῦρος αὐτοῖς τοιάδε ·
And when they had come together, Cyrus addressed them as follows:


7.5.42
3967
ἄνδρες φίλοι καὶ σύμμαχοι , τοῖς μὲν θεοῖς οὐδὲν ἂν ἔχοιμεν μέμψασθαι τὸ μὴ οὐχὶ μέχρι τοῦδε πάντα ὅσα ηὐχόμεθα καταπεπραχέναι ·
Friends and allies, we cannot possibly find any fault with the gods that all that we wished for so far has not been fulfilled.


7.5.42
3968
εἰ μέντοι τοιοῦτον ἔσται τὸ μεγάλα πράττειν ὥστε μὴ οἷόν τ’ εἶναι μήτε ἀμφ’ αὑτὸν σχολὴν ἔχειν μήτε μετὰ τῶν φίλων εὐφρανθῆναι , ἐγὼ μὲν χαίρειν ταύτην τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν κελεύω .
However, if great success is to have such consequences that a man is not to be able to have some leisure for himself nor time to enjoy himself with his friends, I am ready to bid farewell to that sort of happiness.


7.5.43
3969
ἐνενοήσατε γάρ , ἔφη , καὶ χθὲς δήπου ὅτι ἕωθεν ἀρξάμενοι ἀκούειν τῶν προσιόντων οὐκ ἐλήξαμεν πρόσθεν ἑσπέρας ·
For yesterday, too, you saw, of course, that although we began at dawn to give audience to those who came to see us, we did not get through before evening;


7.5.43
3970
καὶ νῦν ὁρᾶτε τούτους ἄλλους πλείονας τῶν χθὲς παρόντας ὡς πράγματα ἡμῖν παρέξοντας .
and now you see that these others, who are here in greater numbers than came yesterday, will give us even more trouble.


7.5.44
3971
εἰ οὖν τις τούτοις ὑφέξει ἑαυτόν , λογίζομαι μικρὸν μέν τι ὑμῖν μέρος ἐμοῦ μετεσόμενον , μικρὸν δέ τι ἐμοὶ ὑμῶν ·
If, therefore, one is to sacrifice oneself to such affairs, I reckon that you will have but a small part in my society or I in yours;


7.5.44
3972
ἐμαυτοῦ μέντοι σαφῶς οἶδ’ ὅτι οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν μοι μετέσται .
while in myself I know that I shall certainly have no part at all.


7.5.45
3973
ἔτι δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ ἄλλο ὁρῶ γελοῖον πρᾶγμα ·
I see also, he went on, still another absurd feature in all this:


7.5.45
3974
ἐγὼ γὰρ δήπου ὑμῖν μὲν ὥσπερ εἰκὸς διάκειμαι ·
while my affection for you is, as you know, what it naturally ought to be,


7.5.45
3975
τούτων δὲ τῶν περιεστηκότων ἤ τινα ἢ οὐδένα οἶδα , καὶ οὗτοι πάντες οὕτω παρεσκευασμένοι εἰσὶν ὡς , ἢν νικῶσιν ὑμᾶς ὠθοῦντες , πρότεροι ἃ βούλονται ὑμῶν παρ’ ἐμοῦ διαπραξόμενοι .
of these who stand about here I know few or none; and yet all these have made up their minds that if they can get ahead of you in crowding in, they will obtain what they wish from me before you can.


7.5.45
3976
ἐγὼ δὲ ἠξίουν τοὺς τοιούτους , εἴ τίς τι ἐμοῦ δέοιτο , θεραπεύειν ὑμᾶς τοὺς ἐμοὺς φίλους δεομένους προσαγωγῆς .
Now what I expected all such to do, if any one wanted anything from me, was to get into favour with you as my friends and ask you for an introduction.


7.5.46
3977
ἴσως ἂν οὖν εἴποι τις , τί δῆτα οὐχ οὕτως ἐξ ἀρχῆς παρεσκευασάμην , ἀλλὰ παρεῖχον ἐν τῷ μέσῳ ἐμαυτόν .
Perhaps some one may ask why I did not adopt this arrangement in the beginning instead of making myself accessible to all.


7.5.46
3978
ὅτι τὰ τοῦ πολέμου τοιαῦτα ἐγίγνωσκον ὄντα ὡς μὴ ὑστερίζειν δέον τὸν ἄρχοντα μήτε τῷ εἰδέναι ἃ δεῖ μήτε τῷ πράττειν ἃ ἂν καιρὸς ᾖ ·
It was, I answer, because I realized that the demands of war made it necessary for a commander not to be behind others in finding out what he ought to know nor in doing what it is expedient that he should do.


7.5.46
3979
τοὺς δὲ σπανίους ἰδεῖν στρατηγοὺς πολλὰ ἐνόμιζον ὧν δεῖ πραχθῆναι παριέναι .
And I thought generals who were seldom to be seen often neglected much that needed to be done.


7.5.47
3980
νῦν δ’ ἐπειδὴ καὶ ὁ φιλοπονώτατος πόλεμος ἀναπέπαυται , δοκεῖ μοι καὶ ἡ ἐμὴ ψυχὴ ἀναπαύσεώς τινος ἀξιοῦν τυγχάνειν .
But now that this most toilsome war is really over, it seems to me that I, too, am entitled to find some relaxation of spirit.


7.5.47
3981
ὡς οὖν ἐμοῦ ἀποροῦντος ὅ τι ἂν τύχοιμι ποιῶν ὥστε καλῶς ἔχειν τά τε ἡμέτερα καὶ τὰ τῶν ἄλλων ὧν ἡμᾶς δεῖ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι , συμβουλευέτω ὅ τι τις ὁρᾷ συμφορώτατον .
So, while I am in doubt as to what I could do to harmonize our interests and those of the others for whom we must care, let any one who sees what is to the best advantage give me a word of counsel.


7.5.48
3982
Κῦρος μὲν οὕτως εἶπεν ·
Thus Cyrus spoke.


7.5.48
3983
ἀνίσταται δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ Ἀρτάβαζος ὁ συγγενής ποτε φήσας εἶναι καὶ εἶπεν ·
After him Artabazus arose — the man who had once claimed to be his kinsman — and said:


7.5.48
3984
ἦ καλῶς , ἔφη , ἐποίησας , ὦ Κῦρε , ἄρξας τοῦ λόγου .
I am very glad, Cyrus, that you have opened this discussion.


7.5.48
3985
ἐγὼ γὰρ ἔτι νέου μὲν ὄντος σοῦ πάνυ ἀρξάμενος ἐπεθύμουν φίλος γενέσθαι , ὁρῶν δέ σε οὐδὲν δεόμενον ἐμοῦ κατώκνουν σοι προσιέναι .
For when you were still a lad, I was very anxious even from the first to be a friend of yours; but when I saw that I could be of no use to you, I shrank from approaching you.


7.5.49
3986
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἔτυχές ποτε καὶ ἐμοῦ δεηθεὶς προθύμως ἐξαγγεῖλαι πρὸς Μήδους τὰ παρὰ Κυαξάρου , ἐλογιζόμην , εἰ ταῦτα προθύμως σοι συλλάβοιμι , ὡς οἰκεῖός τέ σοι ἐσοίμην καὶ ἐξέσοιτό μοι διαλέγεσθαί σοι ὁπόσον χρόνον βουλοίμην .
But when you once happened to need even my services to publish among the Medes the concession obtained from Cyaxares,


7.5.49
3987
καὶ ἐκεῖνα μὲν δὴ ἐπράχθη ὥστε σε ἐπαινεῖν .
I reasoned that, if I gave you my earnest support in this, I then might be your intimate friend and talk with you as much as I pleased. Now that particular commission was executed in such a way as to call for your approval.


7.5.50
3988
μετὰ τοῦτο Ὑρκάνιοι μὲν πρῶτοι φίλοι ἡμῖν ἐγένοντο καὶ μάλα πεινῶσι συμμάχων ·
After that, the Hyrcanians were the first to become our friends, and at a time, too, when we were very hungry for allies,


7.5.50
3989
ὥστε μόνον οὐκ ἐν ταῖς ἀγκάλαις περιεφέρομεν αὐτοὺς ἀγαπῶντες .
so that in our affection for them we all but carried them around in our arms.


7.5.50
3990
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἐπεὶ ἑάλω τὸ πολέμιον στρατόπεδον , οὐκ οἶμαι σχολή σοι ἦν ἀμφ’ ἐμὲ ἔχειν ·
And after that, when the enemy’s camp was taken, you did not have any time to concern yourself about me, I suppose,


7.5.50
3991
καὶ ἐγώ σοι συνεγίγνωσκον .
and I did not blame you.


7.5.51
3992
ἐκ δὲ τούτου Γωβρύας ἡμῖν φίλος ἐγένετο , καὶ ἐγὼ ἔχαιρον ·
Next, Gobryas became our friend, and I was glad;


7.5.51
3993
καὶ αὖθις Γαδάτας ·
and then Gadatas;


7.5.51
3994
καὶ ἤδη ἔργον σοῦ ἦν μεταλαβεῖν .
and then it was hard work to get any share of your attention.


7.5.51
3995
ἐπεί γε μέντοι καὶ Σάκαι καὶ Καδούσιοι σύμμαχοι ἐγεγένηντο , θεραπεύειν εἰκότως ἔδει τούτους ·
When, however, both the Sacians and the Cadusians had become our allies, you must needs show them proper attention,


7.5.51
3996
καὶ γὰρ οὗτοι σὲ ἐθεράπευον .
for they also were attentive to you.


7.5.52
3997
ὡς δ’ ἤλθομεν πάλιν ἔνθεν ὡρμήθημεν , ὁρῶν σε ἀμφ’ ἵππους ἔχοντα , ἀμφ’ ἅρματα , ἀμφὶ μηχανάς , ἡγούμην , ἐπεὶ ἀπὸ τούτων σχολάσαις , τότε σε καὶ ἀμφ’ ἐμὲ ἕξειν σχολήν .
When we came back to the place from which we had started, I saw you busy with horses and chariots and engines,


7.5.52
3998
ὥς γε μέντοι ἦλθεν ἡ δεινὴ ἀγγελία τὸ πάντας ἀνθρώπους ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς συλλέγεσθαι , ἐγίγνωσκον ὅτι ταῦτα μέγιστα εἴη ·
but I thought that as soon as you had leisure from these distractions you would have some time to think of me. Still, when the terrible news came that the whole world was assembling against us, I realized that that was a matter of paramount importance;


7.5.52
3999
εἰ δὲ ταῦτα καλῶς γένοιτο , εὖ ἤδη ἐδόκουν εἰδέναι ὅτι πολλὴ ἔσοιτο ἀφθονία τῆς ἐμῆς καὶ τῆς σῆς συνουσίας .
but if it should turn out successfully, then at last I thought I might be sure that the intercourse between me and you would be unstinted.


7.5.53
4000
καὶ νῦν δὴ νενικήκαμέν τε τὴν μεγάλην μάχην καὶ Σάρδεις καὶ Κροῖσον ὑποχείριον ἔχομεν καὶ Βαβυλῶνα ᾑρήκαμεν καὶ πάντας κατεστράμμεθα , καὶ μὰ τὸν Μίθρην ἐγώ τοι ἐχθές , εἰ μὴ πολλοῖς διεπύκτευσα , οὐκ ἂν ἐδυνάμην σοι προσελθεῖν .
And now we have won the great battle and have Sardis and Croesus in subjection; we have taken Babylon and subjugated everything;


7.5.53
4001
ἐπεί γε μέντοι ἐδεξιώσω με καὶ παρὰ σοὶ ἐκέλευσας μένειν , ἤδη περίβλεπτος ἦν , ὅτι μετὰ σοῦ ἄσιτος καὶ ἄποτος διημέρευον .
and yet yesterday, by Mithras, if I had not fought my way through the crowd with my fists, I vow I could not have got near you. However, when you took me by the hand and bade me stay by you, I was the object of all envious eyes, for having spent a whole day with you — without a thing to eat or drink.


7.5.54
4002
νῦν οὖν εἰ μὲν ἔσται πῃ ὅπως οἱ πλείστου ἄξιοι γεγενημένοι πλεῖστόν σου μέρος μεθέξομεν ·
If, therefore, it can now be so arranged that we, who have proved ourselves most deserving, shall have the largest share of your company, well and good;


7.5.54
4003
εἰ δὲ μή , πάλιν αὖ ἐγὼ ἐθέλω παρὰ σοῦ ἐξαγγέλλειν ἀπιέναι πάντας ἀπὸ σοῦ πλὴν ἡμῶν τῶν ἐξ ἀρχῆς φίλων .
if not, I am ready once again to make a proclamation in your name to the effect that all shall keep away from you, except us who have been your friends from the beginning.


7.5.55
4004
ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἐγέλασε μὲν ὁ Κῦρος καὶ ἄλλοι πολλοί ·
At this Cyrus laughed as did many others.


7.5.55
4005
Χρυσάντας δ’ ἀνέστη ὁ Πέρσης καὶ ἔλεξεν ὧδε ·
Then Chrysantas, the Persian, rose and spoke as follows:


7.5.55
4006
ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν πρόσθεν , ὦ Κῦρε , εἰκότως ἐν τῷ φανερῷ σαυτὸν παρεῖχες , δι’ ἅ τε αὐτὸς εἶπας καὶ ὅτι οὐχ ἡμᾶς σοι μάλιστα ἦν θεραπευτέον .
Well, Cyrus, it was hitherto quite proper for you to make yourself approachable, for the reasons you have yourself assigned and also because we were not the ones whose favour you most needed to win;


7.5.55
4007
ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ καὶ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἕνεκα παρῆμεν ·
for we were with you for our own sakes.


7.5.55
4008
τὸ δὲ πλῆθος ἔδει ἀνακτᾶσθαι ἐκ παντὸς τρόπου , ὅπως ὅτι ἥδιστα συμπονεῖν καὶ συγκινδυνεύειν ἡμῖν ἐθέλοιεν .
But it was imperative for you in every way to win the affections of the multitude, so that they might consent to toil and risk their lives with us as gladly as possible.


7.5.56
4009
νῦν δ’ ἐπεὶ οὐ τούτους τρόπον μόνον ἔχεις , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλλους ἀνακτᾶσθαι δύνασαι οὓς καιρὸς εἴη , ἤδη καὶ οἰκίας σε τυχεῖν ἄξιον ·
But now, seeing that you do not hold your power by this method alone but are in a position in still other ways to win the hearts of those whom it is of advantage for you to win,


7.5.56
4010
ἢ τί ἀπολαύσαις ἂν τῆς ἀρχῆς , εἰ μόνος ἄμοιρος εἴης ἑστίας , οὗ οὔτε ὁσιώτερον χωρίον ἐν ἀνθρώποις οὔτε ἥδιον οὔτε οἰκειότερόν ἐστιν οὐδέν ;
it is meet that you should now have a home. Else what enjoyment would you have of your power, if you alone were to have no hearth and home of your own? For there is no spot on earth more sacred, more sweet, or more dear than that.


7.5.56
4011
ἔπειτα δ’ , ἔφη , οὐκ ἂν οἴει καὶ ἡμᾶς αἰσχύνεσθαι , εἰ σὲ μὲν ὁρῷμεν ἔξω καρτεροῦντα , αὐτοὶ δ’ ἐν οἰκίαις εἴημεν καὶ σοῦ δοκοίημεν πλεονεκτεῖν ;
And finally, he said, do you not think that we also should be ashamed to see you living in discomfort, out of doors, while we ourselves lived in houses and seemed to be better off than you?


7.5.57
4012
ἐπεὶ δὲ Χρυσάντας ταῦτα ἔλεξε , συνηγόρευον αὐτῷ κατὰ τ- αὐτὰ πολλοί .
When Chrysantas had finished his speech, many supported him in the same tenor.


7.5.57
4013
ἐκ τούτου δὴ εἰσέρχεται εἰς τὰ βασίλεια , καὶ τὰ ἐκ Σάρδεων χρήματα ἐνταῦθ’ οἱ ἄγοντες ἀπέδοσαν .
After that, Cyrus moved into the royal palace, and those who had charge of the treasures brought from Sardis delivered them there.


7.5.57
4014
ἐπεὶ δ’ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ Κῦρος , πρῶτον μὲν Ἑστίᾳ ἔθυσεν , ἔπειτα Διὶ βασιλεῖ καὶ εἴ τινι ἄλλῳ θεῷ οἱ μάγοι ἐξηγοῦντο .
And after he took possession, Cyrus sacrificed first to Hestia, then to sovereign Zeus, and then to any other god that the magi suggested.


7.5.58
4015
ποιήσας δὲ ταῦτα τὰ ἄλλα ἤδη ἤρχετο διοικεῖν .
This done, he began at once to organize the rest of his court.


7.5.58
4016
ἐννοῶν δὲ τὸ αὑτοῦ πρᾶγμα ὅτι ἐπιχειροίη μὲν ἄρχειν πολλῶν ἀνθρώπων , παρασκευάζοιτο δὲ οἰκεῖν ἐν πόλει τῇ μεγίστῃ τῶν φανερῶν , αὕτη δ’ οὕτως ἔχοι αὐτῷ ὡς πολεμιωτάτη ἂν γένοιτο ἀνδρὶ πόλις , ταῦτα δὴ λογιζόμενος φυλακῆς περὶ τὸ σῶμα ἡγήσατο δεῖσθαι .
And as he considered his own situation, that he was undertaking to hold sway over many people, and preparing to dwell in the greatest of all famous cities, and that that city was as hostile to him as a city could be to any man — as he reflected on this, he decided that he needed a body-guard.


7.5.59
4017
γνοὺς δ’ ὅτι οὐδαμοῦ ἄνθρωποι εὐχειρωτότεροί εἰσιν ἢ ἐν σίτοις καὶ ποτοῖς καὶ λουτροῖς καὶ κοίτῃ καὶ ὕπνῳ , ἐσκόπει τίνας ἂν ἐν τούτοις περὶ αὑτὸν πιστοτάτους ἔχοι .
And as he realized that men are nowhere an easier prey to violence than when at meals or at wine, in the bath, or in bed and asleep,


7.5.59
4018
ἐνόμισε δὲ μὴ ἂν γενέσθαι ποτὲ πιστὸν ἄνθρωπον ὅστις ἄλλον μᾶλλον φιλήσοι τοῦ τῆς φυλακῆς δεομένου .
he looked around to see who were the most faithful men that he could have around him at such times; and he held that no man was ever faithful who loved any one else better than the one who needed his protection.


7.5.60
4019
τοὺς μὲν οὖν ἔχοντας παῖδας ἢ γυναῖκας συναρμοττούσας ἢ παιδικὰ ἔγνω φύσει ἠναγκάσθαι ταῦτα μάλιστα φιλεῖν ·
Those, therefore, who had children or congenial wives or sweethearts, such he believed were by nature constrained to love them best.


7.5.60
4020
τοὺς δ’ εὐνούχους ὁρῶν πάντων τούτων στερομένους ἡγήσατο τούτους ἂν περὶ πλείστου ποιεῖσθαι οἵτινες δύναιντο πλουτίζειν μάλιστα αὐτοὺς καὶ βοηθεῖν , εἴ τι ἀδικοῖντο , καὶ τιμὰς περιάπτειν αὐτοῖς ·
But as he observed that eunuchs were not susceptible to any such affections, he thought that they would esteem most highly those who were in the best position to make them rich and to stand by them, if ever they were wronged, and to place them in offices of honour;


7.5.60
4021
τούτοις δ’ εὐεργετοῦντα ὑπερβάλλειν αὐτὸν οὐδέν’ ἂν ἡγεῖτο δύνασθαι .
and no one, he thought, could surpass him in bestowing favours of that kind.


7.5.61
4022
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἄδοξοι ὄντες οἱ εὐνοῦχοι παρὰ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀνθρώποις καὶ διὰ τοῦτο δεσπότου ἐπικούρου προσδέονται ·
Besides, inasmuch as eunuchs are objects of contempt to the rest of mankind, for this reason, if for no other, they need a master who will be their patron;


7.5.61
4023
οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἀνὴρ ὅστις οὐκ ἂν ἀξιώσειεν εὐνούχου πλέον ἔχειν ἐν παντί , εἰ μή τι ἄλλο κρεῖττον ἀπείργοι ·
for there is no man who would not think that he had a right to take advantage of a eunuch at every opportunity unless there were some higher power to prevent his doing so;


7.5.61
4024
δεσπότῃ δὲ πιστὸν ὄντα οὐδὲν κωλύει πρωτεύειν καὶ τὸν εὐνοῦχον .
but there is no reason why even a eunuch should not be superior to all others in fidelity to his master.


7.5.62
4025
ὃ δ’ ἂν μάλιστά τις οἰηθείη , ἀνάλκιδας τοὺς εὐνούχους γίγνεσθαι , οὐδὲ τοῦτο ἐφαίνετο αὐτῷ .
But he did not admit what many might very easily be inclined to suppose, that eunuchs are weaklings;


7.5.62
4026
ἐτεκμαίρετο δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἄλλων ζῴων ὅτι οἵ τε ὑβρισταὶ ἵπποι ἐκτεμνόμενοι τοῦ μὲν δάκνειν καὶ ὑβρίζειν ἀποπαύονται , πολεμικοὶ δὲ οὐδὲν ἧττον γίγνονται , οἵ τε ταῦροι ἐκτεμνόμενοι τοῦ μὲν μέγα φρονεῖν καὶ ἀπειθεῖν ὑφίενται , τοῦ δ’ ἰσχύειν καὶ ἐργάζεσθαι οὐ στερίσκονται , καὶ οἱ κύνες δὲ ὡσαύτως τοῦ μὲν ἀπολείπειν τοὺς δεσπότας ἀποπαύονται ἐκτεμνόμενοι , φυλάττειν δὲ καὶ εἰς θήραν οὐδὲν κακίους γίγνονται .
and he drew this conclusion also from the case of other animals: for instance, vicious horses, when gelded, stop biting and prancing about, to be sure, but are none the less fit for service in war; and bulls, when castrated, lose somewhat of their high spirit and unruliness but are not deprived of their strength or capacity for work. And in the same way dogs, when castrated, stop running away from their masters, but are no less useful for watching or hunting.


7.5.63
4027
καὶ οἵ γε ἄνθρωποι ὡσαύτως ἠρεμέστεροι γίγνονται στερισκόμενοι ταύτης τῆς ἐπιθυμίας , οὐ μέντοι ἀμελέστεροί γε τῶν προσταττομένων , οὐδ’ ἧττόν τι ἱππικοί , οὐδὲ ἧττόν τι ἀκοντιστικοί , οὐδὲ ἧττον φιλότιμοι .
And men, too, in the same way, become gentler when deprived of this desire, but not less careful of that which is entrusted to them; they are not made any less efficient horsemen, or any less skilful lancers, or less ambitious men.


7.5.64
4028
κατάδηλοι δ’ ἐγίγνοντο καὶ ἐν τοῖς πολέμοις καὶ ἐν ταῖς θήραις ὅτι ἔσῳζον τὸ φιλόνικον ἐν ταῖς ψυχαῖς .
On the contrary, they showed both in times of war and in hunting that they still preserved in their souls a spirit of rivalry;


7.5.64
4029
τοῦ δὲ πιστοὶ εἶναι ἐν τῇ φθορᾷ τῶν δεσποτῶν μάλιστα βάσανον ἐδίδοσαν ·
and of their fidelity they gave the best proof upon the fall of their masters,


7.5.64
4030
οὐδένες γὰρ πιστότερα ἔργα ἀπεδείκνυντο ἐν ταῖς δεσποτικαῖς συμφοραῖς τῶν εὐνούχων .
for no one ever performed acts of greater fidelity in his master’s misfortunes than eunuchs do.


7.5.65
4031
εἰ δέ τι ἄρα τῆς τοῦ σώματος ἰσχύος μειοῦσθαι δοκοῦσιν , ὁ σίδηρος ἀνισοῖ τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς τοῖς ἰσχυροῖς ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ .
And if it is thought with some justice that they are inferior in bodily strength, yet on the field of battle steel makes the weak equal to the strong.


7.5.65
4032
ταῦτα δὴ γιγνώσκων ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῶν θυρωρῶν πάντας τοὺς περὶ τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σῶμα θεραπευτῆρας ἐποιήσατο εὐνούχους .
Recognizing these facts, he selected eunuchs for every post of personal service to him, from the door-keepers up.


7.5.66
4033
ἡγησάμενος δὲ οὐχ ἱκανὴν εἶναι τὴν φυλακὴν ταύτην πρὸς τὸ πλῆθος τῶν δυσμενῶς ἐχόντων , ἐσκόπει τίνας τῶν ἄλλων ἂν πιστοτάτους περὶ τὸ βασίλειον φύλακας λάβοι .
But, as he deemed this guard insufficient in view of the multitude of those who bore him ill-will, he looked around to see whom he could find among the rest who would be the most trustworthy guards about the palace.


7.5.67
4034
εἰδὼς οὖν Πέρσας τοὺς οἴκοι κακοβιωτάτους μὲν ὄντας διὰ πενίαν , ἐπιπονώτατα δὲ ζῶντας διὰ τὴν τῆς χώρας τραχύτητα καὶ διὰ τὸ αὐτουργοὺς εἶναι , τούτους ἐνόμισε μάλιστ’ ἂν ἀγαπᾶν τὴν παρ’ αὑτῷ δίαιταν .
Now he knew that the Persians on account of their poverty lived in the greatest privation at home and were accustomed to a life of the hardest toil, because their country was rugged and they had to work with their own hands; so he believed that they would especially welcome life with him.


7.5.68
4035
λαμβάνει οὖν τούτων μυρίους δορυφόρους , οἳ κύκλῳ μὲν νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας ἐφύλαττον περὶ τὰ βασίλεια , ὁπότε ἐπὶ χώρας εἴη ·
Accordingly, he took from among them ten thousand spearmen, who kept guard about the palace day and night, whenever he was in residence;


7.5.68
4036
ὁπότε δὲ ἐξίοι ποι , ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν τεταγμένοι ἐπορεύοντο .
but whenever he went away anywhere, they went along drawn up in order on either side of him.


7.5.69
4037
νομίσας δὲ καὶ Βαβυλῶνος ὅλης φύλακας δεῖν εἶναι ἱκανούς , εἴτ’ ἐπιδημῶν αὐτὸς τυγχάνοι εἴτε καὶ ἀποδημῶν , κατέστησε καὶ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι φρουροὺς ἱκανούς ·
And since he considered that all Babylon, too, stood in need of adequate protection, whether he himself happened to be at home or abroad,


7.5.69
4038
μισθὸν δὲ καὶ τούτοις Βαβυλωνίους ἔταξε παρέχειν , βουλόμενος αὐτοὺς ὡς ἀμηχανωτάτους εἶναι , ὅπως ὅτι ταπεινότατοι καὶ εὐκαθεκτότατοι εἶεν .
he stationed there also an adequate garrison, and he arranged that the Babylonians should furnish the money for their wages, for it was his aim that this people should be as destitute of resources as possible, so that they might be as submissive and as easily restrained as possible.


7.5.70
4039
αὕτη μὲν δὴ ἡ περὶ αὐτόν τε φυλακὴ καὶ ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι τότε κατασταθεῖσα καὶ νῦν ἔτι οὕτως ἔχουσα διαμένει .
This guard that he then established about himself and in the city of Babylon is maintained on the same footing even to this day.


7.5.70
4040
σκοπῶν δ’ ὅπως ἂν καὶ ἡ πᾶσα ἀρχὴ κατέχοιτο καὶ ἄλλη ἔτι προσγίγνοιτο , ἡγήσατο τοὺς μισθοφόρους τούτους οὐ τοσοῦτον βελτίονας τῶν ὑπηκόων εἶναι ὅσον ἐλάττονας ·
And as he studied how his whole empire might be held together and at the same time enlarged, he reflected that these mercenaries were not so much better men than those he had made subject as they were inferior in number;


7.5.70
4041
τοὺς δὲ ἀγαθοὺς ἄνδρας ἐγίγνωσκε συνεκτέον εἶναι , οἵπερ σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς τὸ κρατεῖν παρέσχον , καὶ ἐπιμελητέον ὅπως μὴ ἀνήσουσι τὴν τῆς ἀρετῆς ἄσκησιν .
and he realized that the brave men, who with the aid of the gods had brought him victory, must be kept together and that care must be exercised that they should not abandon their practice of virtue.


7.5.71
4042
ὅπως δὲ μὴ ἐπιτάττειν αὐτοῖς δοκοίη , ἀλλὰ γνόντες καὶ αὐτοὶ ταῦτα ἄριστα εἶναι οὕτως ἐμμένοιέν τε καὶ ἐπιμελοῖντο τῆς ἀρετῆς , συνέλεξε τούς τε ὁμοτίμους καὶ πάντας ὁπόσοι ἐπικαίριοι ἦσαν καὶ ἀξιοχρεώτατοι ἐδόκουν αὐτῷ κοινωνοὶ εἶναι καὶ πόνων καὶ ἀγαθῶν .
But in order that he might not seem to be issuing orders to them, but that they also might of themselves recognize that this was the best course for them and so abide in virtue and cultivate it, he collected the peers and all who were men of influence, together with such as seemed to him most worthy sharers of his toil and its rewards;


7.5.72
4043
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνῆλθον , ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
and when they had come together he addressed them as follows:


7.5.72
4044
ἄνδρες φίλοι καὶ σύμμαχοι , τοῖς μὲν θεοῖς μεγίστη χάρις ὅτι ἔδοσαν ἡμῖν τυχεῖν ὧν ἐνομίζομεν ἄξιοι εἶναι .
Friends and allies, thanks be above all to the gods that they have vouchsafed to us to obtain all that we thought we deserved.


7.5.72
4045
νῦν γὰρ δὴ ἔχομεν καὶ γῆν πολλὴν καὶ ἀγαθὴν καὶ οἵτινες ταύτην ἐργαζόμενοι θρέψουσιν ἡμᾶς ·
For now we are in possession of broad and fertile lands and of subjects to support us by tilling them;


7.5.72
4046
ἔχομεν δὲ καὶ οἰκίας καὶ ἐν ταύταις κατασκευάς .
we have houses also and furniture in them.


7.5.73
4047
καὶ μηδείς γε ὑμῶν ἔχων ταῦτα νομισάτω ἀλλότρια ἔχειν ·
And let not one of you think that in having these things he has what does not belong to him;


7.5.73
4048
νόμος γὰρ ἐν πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἀίδιός ἐστιν , ὅταν πολεμούντων πόλις ἁλῷ , τῶν ἑλόντων εἶναι καὶ τὰ σώματα τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ τὰ χρήματα .
for it is a law established for all time among all men that when a city is taken in war, the persons and the property of the inhabitants thereof belong to the captors.


7.5.73
4049
οὔκουν ἀδικίᾳ γε ἕξετε ὅ τι ἂν ἔχητε , ἀλλὰ φιλανθρωπίᾳ οὐκ ἀφαιρήσεσθε , ἤν τι ἐᾶτε ἔχειν αὐτούς .
It will, therefore, be no injustice for you to keep what you have, but if you let them keep anything, it will be only out of generosity that you do not take it away.


7.5.74
4050
τὸ μέντοι ἐκ τοῦδε οὕτως ἐγὼ γιγνώσκω ὅτι εἰ μὲν τρεψόμεθα ἐπὶ ῥᾳδιουργίαν καὶ τὴν τῶν κακῶν ἀνθρώπων ἡδυπάθειαν , οἳ νομίζουσι τὸ μὲν πονεῖν ἀθλιότητα , τὸ δὲ ἀπόνως βιοτεύειν εὐδαιμονίαν , ταχὺ ἡμᾶς φημι ὀλίγου ἀξίους ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ἔσεσθαι καὶ ταχὺ πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν στερήσεσθαι .
As for the future, however, it is my judgment that if we turn to idleness and the luxurious self-indulgence of men of coarse natures, who count toil misery and living without toil happiness, we shall soon be of little account in our own eyes and shall soon lose all the blessings that we have.


7.5.75
4051
οὐ γάρ τοι τὸ ἀγαθοὺς ἄνδρας γενέσθαι τοῦτο ἀρκεῖ ὥστε καὶ διατελεῖν ὄντας ἀγαθούς , ἢν μή τις αὐτοῦ διὰ τέλους ἐπιμελῆται ·
For, to have quitted yourselves once like valiant men does not, we know, assure the perpetuity of valour, unless you devote yourselves to it to the end;


7.5.75
4052
ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι τέχναι ἀμεληθεῖσαι μείονος ἄξιαι γίγνονται καὶ τὰ σώματά γε τὰ εὖ ἔχοντα , ὁπόταν τις αὐτὰ ἀνῇ ἐπὶ ῥᾳδιουργίαν , πονήρως πάλιν ἔχει , οὕτω καὶ ἡ σωφροσύνη καὶ ἡ ἐγκράτεια καὶ ἡ ἀλκή , ὁπόταν τις αὐτῶν ἀνῇ τὴν ἄσκησιν , ἐκ τούτου εἰς τὴν πονηρίαν πάλιν τρέπεται .
but, just as skill in other arts retrogrades if neglected, and as bodies, too, that were once in good condition change and deteriorate as soon as the owners relax into idleness, so also self-control and temperance and strength will take a backward turn to vice as soon as one ceases to cultivate them.


7.5.76
4053
οὔκουν δεῖ ἀμελεῖν οὐδ’ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτίκα ἡδὺ προϊέναι αὑτούς .
Therefore, we dare not become careless nor give ourselves up to the enjoyment of the present moment;


7.5.76
4054
μέγα μὲν γὰρ οἶμαι ἔργον καὶ τὸ ἀρχὴν καταπρᾶξαι , πολὺ δ’ ἔτι μεῖζον τὸ λαβόντα διασώσασθαι .
for, while I think it is a great thing to have won an empire, it is a still greater thing to preserve it after it has been won.


7.5.76
4055
τὸ μὲν γὰρ λαβεῖν πολλάκις τῷ τόλμαν μόνον παρασχομένῳ ἐγένετο , τὸ δὲ λαβόντα κατέχειν οὐκέτι τοῦτο ἄνευ σωφροσύνης οὐδ’ ἄνευ ἐγκρατείας οὐδ’ ἄνευ πολλῆς ἐπιμελείας γίγνεται .
For to win falls often to the lot of one who has shown nothing but daring; but to win and hold — that is no longer a possibility without the exercise of self-control, temperance, and unflagging care.


7.5.77
4056
ἃ χρὴ γιγνώσκοντας νῦν πολὺ μᾶλλον ἀσκεῖν τὴν ἀρετὴν ἢ πρὶν τάδε τ- ἀγαθὰ κτήσασθαι , εὖ εἰδότας ὅτι ὅταν πλεῖστά τις ἔχῃ , τότε πλεῖστοι καὶ φθονοῦσι καὶ ἐπιβουλεύουσι καὶ πολέμιοι γίγνονται , ἄλλως τε κἂν παρ’ ἀκόντων τά τε κτήματα καὶ τὴν θεραπείαν ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς ἔχῃ .
Recognizing all this, we ought to practise virtue even more than we did before we secured these advantages,


7.5.77
4057
τοὺς μὲν οὖν θεοὺς οἴεσθαι χρὴ σὺν ἡμῖν ἔσεσθαι ·
for we may be sure that the more a man has, the more people will envy him and plot against him and become his enemies, particularly if, as in our case, he draws his wealth and service from unwilling hands.


7.5.77
4058
οὐ γὰρ ἐπιβουλεύσαντες ἀδίκως ἔχομεν , ἀλλ’ ἐπιβουλευθέντες ἐτιμωρησάμεθα .
We must, therefore, believe that the gods will be on our side; for we have not come unjustly into our possessions through plotting against others, but plotted against we have avenged ourselves.


7.5.78
4059
τὸ μέντοι μετὰ τοῦτο κράτιστον ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς παρασκευαστέον ·
But that which is next in importance after the favour of the gods we must get for ourselves —


7.5.78
4060
τοῦτο δ’ ἐστὶ τὸ βελτίονας ὄντας τῶν ἀρχομένων ἄρχειν ἀξιοῦν .
namely, we must claim the right to rule over our subjects only on the ground that we are their betters.


7.5.78
4061
θάλπους μὲν οὖν καὶ ψύχους καὶ σίτων καὶ ποτῶν καὶ πόνων καὶ ὕπνου ἀνάγκη καὶ τοῖς δούλοις μεταδιδόναι ·
Now the conditions of heat and cold, food and drink, toil and rest, we must share even with our slaves.


7.5.78
4062
μεταδιδόντας γε μέντοι πειρᾶσθαι δεῖ ἐν τούτοις πρῶτον βελτίονας αὐτῶν φαίνεσθαι .
But though we share with them, we must above all try to show ourselves their betters in such matters;


7.5.79
4063
πολεμικῆς δ’ ἐπιστήμης καὶ μελέτης παντάπασιν οὐ μεταδοτέον τούτοις , οὕστινας ἐργάτας ἡμετέρους καὶ δασμοφόρους βουλόμεθα καταστήσασθαι , ἀλλ’ αὐτοὺς δεῖ τούτοις τοῖς ἀσκήμασι πλεονεκτεῖν , γιγνώσκοντας ὅτι ἐλευθερίας ταῦτα ὄργανα καὶ εὐδαιμονίας οἱ θεοὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἀπέδειξαν ·
but the science and practice of war we need not share at all with those whom we wish to put in the position of workmen or tributaries to us, but we must maintain our superiority in these accomplishments, as we recognize in these the means to liberty and happiness that the gods have given to men.


7.5.79
4064
καὶ ὥσπερ γε ἐκείνους τὰ ὅπλα ἀφῃρήμεθα , οὕτως ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς δεῖ μήποτ’ ἐρήμους ὅπλων γίγνεσθαι , εὖ εἰδότας ὅτι τοῖς ἀεὶ ἐγγυτάτω τῶν ὅπλων οὖσι τούτοις καὶ οἰκειότατά ἐστιν ἃ ἂν βούλωνται .
And just as we have taken their arms away from them, so surely must we never be without our own, for we know that the nearer to their arms men constantly are, the more completely at their command is their every wish.


7.5.80
4065
εἰ δέ τις τοιαῦτα ἐννοεῖται , τί δῆτα ἡμῖν ὄφελος καταπρᾶξαι ἃ ἐπεθυμοῦμεν , εἰ ἔτι δεήσει καρτερεῖν καὶ πεινῶντας καὶ διψῶντας καὶ πονοῦντας καὶ ἐπιμελουμένους , ἐκεῖνο δεῖ καταμαθεῖν ὅτι τοσούτῳ τ- ἀγαθὰ μᾶλλον εὐφραίνει ὅσῳ ἂν μᾶλλον προπονήσας τις ἐπ’ αὐτὰ ἴῃ ·
But if any one is revolving in his mind any such questions as this — ‘of what earthly use it is to us to have attained to the goal of our ambitions if we still have to endure hunger and thirst, toil and care’ —


7.5.80
4066
οἱ γὰρ πόνοι ὄψον τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ·
he must take this lesson to heart: that good things bring the greater pleasure, in proportion to the toil one undergoes beforehand to attain them;


7.5.80
4067
ἄνευ δὲ τοῦ δεόμενον τυγχάνειν τινὸς οὐδὲν οὕτω πολυτελῶς παρασκευασθείη ἂν ὥσθ’ ἡδὺ εἶναι .
for toil gives a relish to good things; and nothing, however sumptuously prepared, could give pleasure unless a man get it when he needs it.


7.5.81
4068
εἰ δὲ ὧν μὲν μάλιστα ἄνθρωποι ἐπιθυμοῦσιν ὁ δαίμων ἡμῖν ταῦτα συμπαρεσκεύακεν , ὡς δ’ ἂν ἥδιστα ταῦτα φαίνοιτο αὐτός τις αὑτῷ ταῦτα παρασκευάσει , ὁ τοιοῦτος ἀνὴρ τοσούτῳ πλεονεκτήσει τῶν ἐνδεεστέρων βίου ὡς πεινήσας τῶν ἡδίστων σίτων τεύξεται καὶ διψήσας τῶν ἡδίστων ποτῶν ἀπολαύσεται καὶ δεηθεὶς ἀναπαύσεως ᾗ ἥδιστον ἀναπαύσεται .
Now if God has helped us to obtain that which men most desire, and if any one will so order these results for himself that they shall give as great pleasure as possible, such a man will have this advantage over those who are not so well supplied with the means of living: when hungry he will enjoy the most dainty food, and when thirsty he will enjoy the finest drinks, and when in need of rest he will find it most refreshing.


7.5.82
4069
ὧν ἕνεκά φημι χρῆναι νῦν ἐπιταθῆναι ἡμᾶς εἰς ἀνδραγαθίαν , ὅπως τῶν τε ἀγαθῶν ᾗ ἄριστον καὶ ἥδιστον ἀπολαύσωμεν καὶ ὅπως τοῦ πάντων χαλεπωτάτου ἄπειροι γενώμεθα .
Wherefore I maintain that we should now strain every nerve after manliness, so that we may enjoy our success in the best and most delightful manner and have no experience in that which is hardest of all.


7.5.82
4070
οὐ γὰρ τὸ μὴ λαβεῖν τ- ἀγαθὰ οὕτω χαλεπὸν ὥσπερ τὸ λαβόντα στερηθῆναι λυπηρόν .
For failure to obtain good things is not so hard as the loss of them, when once obtained, is painful.


7.5.83
4071
ἐννοήσατε δὲ κ- ἐκεῖνο τίνα πρόφασιν ἔχοντες ἂν προσιοίμεθα κακίονες ἢ πρόσθεν γενέσθαι .
And think of this also: what excuse should we offer for allowing ourselves to become less deserving than before?


7.5.83
4072
πότερον ὅτι ἄρχομεν ;
That we are rulers?


7.5.83
4073
ἀλλ’ οὐ δήπου τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν ἀρχομένων πονηρότερον προσήκει εἶναι .
But, you know, it is not proper for the ruler to be worse than his subjects.


7.5.83
4074
ἀλλ’ ὅτι εὐδαιμονέστεροι δοκοῦμεν νῦν ἢ πρότερον εἶναι ;
Or that we seem to be more fortunate than before?


7.5.83
4075
ἔπειτα τῇ εὐδαιμονίᾳ φήσει τις τὴν κακίαν ἐπιπρέπειν ;
Will any one then maintain that vice is the proper ornament for good fortune?


7.5.83
4076
ἀλλ’ ὅτι ἐπεὶ κεκτήμεθα δούλους , τούτους κολάσομεν , ἢν πονηροὶ ὦσι ;
Or shall we plead that since we have slaves, we will punish them, if they are bad?


7.5.84
4077
καὶ τί προσήκει αὐτὸν ὄντα πονηρὸν πονηρίας ἕνεκα ἢ βλακείας ἄλλους κολάζειν ;
Why, what propriety is there in any one’s punishing others for viciousness or indolence, when he himself is bad?


7.5.84
4078
ἐννοεῖτε δὲ καὶ τοῦτο ὅτι τρέφειν μὲν παρεσκευάσμεθα πολλοὺς καὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων οἴκων φύλακας καὶ τῶν σωμάτων ·
And think also on this: we have made arrangements to keep many men to guard our homes and our lives;


7.5.84
4079
αἰσχρὸν δὲ πῶς οὐκ ἂν εἴη , εἰ δι’ ἄλλους μὲν δορυφόρους τῆς σωτηρίας οἰησόμεθα χρῆναι τυγχάνειν , αὐτοὶ δὲ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς οὐ δορυφορήσομεν ;
and how would it be otherwise than base in us to think that we have a right to enjoy security protected by other men’s spears, while we ourselves do not take up the spear for our own defence?


7.5.84
4080
καὶ μὴν εὖ γε δεῖ εἰδέναι ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλη φυλακὴ τοιαύτη οἵα αὐτόν τινα καλὸν κ- ἀγαθὸν ὑπάρχειν ·
And yet we must be fully aware that there is no such safeguard as for a man to be good and brave himself;


7.5.84
4081
τοῦτο γὰρ δεῖ συμπαρομαρτεῖν ·
this guard must be ever at our side.


7.5.84
4082
τῷ δ’ ἀρετῆς ἐρήμῳ οὐδὲ ἄλλο καλῶς ἔχειν οὐδὲν προσήκει .
But if a man lack virtue, neither is it fitting that aught else be well with him.


7.5.85
4083
τί οὖν φημι χρῆναι ποιεῖν καὶ ποῦ τὴν ἀρετὴν ἀσκεῖν καὶ ποῦ τὴν μελέτην ποιεῖσθαι ;
What, then, do I propose that we should do, wherein practise virtue, and where apply the practice?


7.5.85
4084
οὐδὲν καινόν , ὦ ἄνδρες , ἐρῶ ·
I have nothing new to tell you, my men;


7.5.85
4085
ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ ἐν Πέρσαις ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀρχείοις οἱ ὁμότιμοι διάγουσιν , οὕτω καὶ ἡμᾶς φημι χρῆναι ἐνθάδε ὄντας τοὺς ὁμοτίμους πάντα ἅπερ κ- ἐκεῖ ἐπιτηδεύειν , καὶ ὑμᾶς τε ἐμὲ ὁρῶντας κατανοεῖν παρόντας εἰ ἐπιμελόμενος ὧν δεῖ διάξω , ἐγώ τε ὑμᾶς κατανοῶν θεάσομαι , καὶ οὓς ἂν ὁρῶ τὰ καλὰ καὶ τ- ἀγαθὰ ἐπιτηδεύοντας , τούτους τιμήσω .
but just as in Persia the peers spend their time at the government buildings, so here also we peers must practise the same things as we did there;  you must be in your places and watch me to see if I continue to do what I ought, and I will watch to see the same in you, and whomsoever I see pursuing what is good and honourable, him will I honour.


7.5.86
4086
καὶ τοὺς παῖδας δέ , οἳ ἂν ἡμῶν γίγνωνται , ἐνθάδε παιδεύωμεν ·
And as for our boys, as many as shall be born to us, let us educate them here.


7.5.86
4087
αὐτοί τε γὰρ βελτίονες ἐσόμεθα , βουλόμενοι τοῖς παισὶν ὡς βέλτιστα παραδείγματα ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς παρέχειν , οἵ τε παῖδες οὐδ’ ἂν εἰ βούλοιντο ῥᾳδίως πονηροὶ γένοιντο , αἰσχρὸν μὲν μηδὲν μήτε ὁρῶντες μήτε ἀκούοντες , ἐν δὲ καλοῖς κ- ἀγαθοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασι διημερεύοντες .
For we ourselves shall be better, if we aim to set before the boys as good examples as we can in ourselves; and the boys could not easily turn out bad, even if they should wish to, if they neither see nor hear anything vicious but spend their days in good and noble pursuits.




8.1.1
4088
Κῦρος μὲν οὖν οὕτως εἶπεν ·
Such was Cyrus’s address;


8.1.1
4089
ἀνέστη δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ Χρυσάντας καὶ εἶπεν ὧδε .
and after him Chrysantas rose and spoke as follows:


8.1.1
4090
ἀλλὰ πολλάκις μὲν δή , ὦ ἄνδρες , καὶ ἄλλοτε κατενόησα ὅτι ἄρχων ἀγαθὸς οὐδὲν διαφέρει πατρὸς ἀγαθοῦ ·
Well, gentlemen, I have noticed often enough before now that a good ruler is not at all different from a good father.


8.1.1
4091
οἵ τε γὰρ πατέρες προνοοῦσι τῶν παίδων ὅπως μήποτε αὐτοὺς τ- ἀγαθὰ ἐπιλείψει , Κῦρός τέ μοι δοκεῖ νῦν συμβουλεύειν ἡμῖν ἀφ’ ὧν μάλιστ’ ἂν εὐδαιμονοῦντες διατελοῖμεν ·
For as fathers provide for their children so that they may never be in want of the good things of life, so Cyrus seems to me now to be giving us counsel how we may best continue in prosperity.


8.1.1
4092
ὃ δέ μοι δοκεῖ ἐνδεέστερον ἢ ὡς ἐχρῆν δηλῶσαι , τοῦτο ἐγὼ πειράσομαι τοὺς μὴ εἰδότας διδάξαι .
But there is one thing that he has not stated so clearly, it seems to me, as he should have done, and that I will try to present to any who do not know about it.


8.1.2
4093
ἐννοήσατε γὰρ δὴ τίς ἂν πόλις πολεμία ὑπὸ μὴ πειθομένων ἁλοίη ·
Bethink you, then, of this: what city that is hostile could be taken


8.1.2
4094
τίς δ’ ἂν φιλία ὑπὸ μὴ πειθομένων διαφυλαχθείη ·
or what city that is friendly could be preserved by soldiers who are insubordinate?


8.1.2
4095
ποῖον δ’ ἂν ἀπειθούντων στράτευμα νίκης τύχοι ·
What army of disobedient men could gain a victory?


8.1.2
4096
πῶς δ’ ἂν μᾶλλον ἐν μάχαις ἡττῷντο ἄνθρωποι ἢ ἐπειδὰν ἄρξωνται ἰδίᾳ ἕκαστος περὶ τῆς αὑτοῦ σωτηρίας βουλεύεσθαι ·
How could men be more easily defeated in battle than when they begin to think each of his own individual safety?


8.1.2
4097
τί δ’ ἂν ἄλλο ἀγαθὸν τελεσθείη ὑπὸ μὴ πειθομένων τοῖς κρείττοσι ·
And what possible success could be achieved by such as do not obey their superiors?


8.1.2
4098
ποῖαι δὲ πόλεις νομίμως ἂν οἰκήσειαν ἢ ποῖοι οἶκοι σωθείησαν ·
What state could be administered according to its laws, or what private establishments could be maintained,


8.1.2
4099
πῶς δ’ ἂν νῆες ὅποι δεῖ ἀφίκοιντο ·
and how could ships arrive at their destination?


8.1.3
4100
ἡμεῖς δὲ ἃ νῦν ἀγαθὰ ἔχομεν διὰ τί ἄλλο μᾶλλον κατεπράξαμεν ἢ διὰ τὸ πείθεσθαι τῷ ἄρχοντι ;
And as for us, how have we secured the good things we now have, except by obedience to our commander?


8.1.3
4101
διὰ τοῦτο γὰρ καὶ νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας ταχὺ μὲν ὅποι ἔδει παρεγιγνόμεθα , ἁθρόοι δὲ τῷ ἄρχοντι ἑπόμενοι ἀνυπόστατοι ἦμεν , τῶν δ’ ἐπιταχθέντων οὐδὲν ἡμιτελὲς κατελείπομεν .
For by that course we always quickly reached our required destination, whether by day or by night, and following our commander in close array we were invincible, and we left half done none of the tasks committed to us.


8.1.3
4102
εἰ τοίνυν μέγιστον ἀγαθὸν τὸ πειθαρχεῖν φαίνεται εἰς τὸ καταπράττειν τ- ἀγαθά , οὕτως εὖ ἴστε ὅτι τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο καὶ εἰς τὸ διασῴζειν ἃ δεῖ μέγιστον ἀγαθόν ἐστι .
If, therefore, obedience to one’s commander is, as it seems, the first essential to achieving success, then you may be sure that this same course is the first essential to ensuring its permanence.


8.1.4
4103
καὶ πρόσθεν μὲν δὴ πολλοὶ ἡμῶν ἦρχον μὲν οὐδενός , ἤρχοντο δέ ·
Heretofore, you know, many of us had no command but were under command;


8.1.4
4104
νῦν δὲ κατεσκεύασθε οὕτω πάντες οἱ παρόντες ὥστε ἄρχετε οἱ μὲν πλειόνων , οἱ δὲ μειόνων .
but now all of you here are so situated that you have command, some of larger, some of smaller divisions.


8.1.4
4105
ὥσπερ τοίνυν αὐτοὶ ἀξιώσετε ἄρχειν τῶν ὑφ’ ὑμῖν , οὕτω καὶ αὐτοὶ πειθώμεθα οἷς ἂν ἡμᾶς καθήκῃ .
Therefore, as you yourselves will expect to exercise authority over those under your command, so let us also give our obedience to those whom it is our duty to obey.


8.1.4
4106
τοσοῦτον δὲ διαφέρειν δεῖ τῶν δούλων ὅσον οἱ μὲν δοῦλοι ἄκοντες τοῖς δεσπόταις ὑπηρετοῦσιν , ἡμᾶς δ’ , εἴπερ ἀξιοῦμεν ἐλεύθεροι εἶναι , ἑκόντας δεῖ ποιεῖν ὃ πλείστου ἄξιον φαίνεται εἶναι .
And we must distinguish ourselves from slaves in this way, that, whereas slaves serve their masters against their wills, we, if indeed we claim to be free, must do of our own free will all that seems to be of the first importance.


8.1.4
4107
εὑρήσετε δ’ , ἔφη , καὶ ἔνθα ἄνευ μοναρχίας πόλις οἰκεῖται , τὴν μάλιστα τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἐθέλουσαν πείθεσθαι ταύτην ἥκιστα τῶν πολεμίων ἀναγκαζομένην ὑπακούειν .
And you will find that among states, even when the government is not a monarchy, that state which most readily obeys its officers is least likely to be compelled to submit to its enemies.


8.1.5
4108
παρῶμέν τε οὖν , ὥσπερ Κῦρος κελεύει , ἐπὶ τόδε τὸ ἀρχεῖον , ἀσκῶμέν τε δι’ ὧν μάλιστα δυνησόμεθα κατέχειν ἃ δεῖ , παρέχωμέν τε ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς χρῆσθαι Κύρῳ ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ .
Let us, therefore, present ourselves before our ruler’s headquarters yonder, as Cyrus bids; let us devote ourselves to those pursuits by which we shall best be able to hold fast to that which we ought, and let us offer ourselves for whatever service Cyrus may need us for.


8.1.5
4109
καὶ τοῦτο γὰρ εὖ εἰδέναι χρὴ ὅτι οὐ μὴ δυνήσεται Κῦρος εὑρεῖν ὅ τι αὑτῷ μὲν ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ χρήσεται , ἡμῖν δὲ οὔ , ἐπείπερ τά γε αὐτὰ ἡμῖν συμφέρει καὶ οἱ αὐτοί εἰσιν ἡμῖν πολέμιοι .
And this trust will not be abused, for we may be sure that Cyrus will never be able to find anything in which he can employ us for his own advantage and not equally for ours; for we have common interests and we have common enemies.


8.1.6
4110
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα εἶπε Χρυσάντας , οὕτω δὴ καὶ ἄλλοι ἀνίσταντο πολλοὶ καὶ Περσῶν καὶ τῶν συμμάχων συνεροῦντες ·
When Chrysantas had finished this address, many others also both of the Persians and the allies rose to support him.


8.1.6
4111
καὶ ἔδοξε τοὺς ἐντίμους ἀεὶ παρεῖναι ἐπὶ θύρας καὶ παρέχειν αὑτοὺς χρῆσθαι ὅ τι ἂν βούληται , ἕως ἀφείη Κῦρος .
They passed a resolution that the nobles should always be in attendance at court and be in readiness for whatever service Cyrus wished until he should dismiss them.


8.1.6
4112
ὡς δὲ τότε ἔδοξεν , οὕτω καὶ νῦν ἔτι ποιοῦσιν οἱ κατὰ τὴν Ἀσίαν ὑπὸ βασιλεῖ ὄντες , θεραπεύουσι τὰς τῶν ἀρχόντων θύρας .
And as they then resolved, so even unto this day those who are the subjects of the great king in Asia continue to do — they are constantly in attendance at the court of their princes.


8.1.7
4113
ὡς δ’ ἐν τῷ λόγῳ δεδήλωται Κῦρος καταστησάμενος εἰς τὸ διαφυλάττειν αὑτῷ τε καὶ Πέρσαις τὴν ἀρχήν , τ- αὐτὰ καὶ οἱ μετ’ ἐκεῖνον βασιλεῖς νόμιμα ἔτι καὶ νῦν διατελοῦσι ποιοῦντες .
And the institutions which Cyrus  inaugurated as a means of securing the kingdom permanently to himself and the Persians, as has been set forth in the foregoing narrative, these the succeeding kings have preserved unchanged even to this day.


8.1.8
4114
οὕτω δ’ ἔχει καὶ ταῦτα ὥσπερ καὶ τ- ἄλλα ·
And it is the same with these as with everything else:


8.1.8
4115
ὅταν μὲν ὁ ἐπιστάτης βελτίων γένηται , καθαρώτερον τὰ νόμιμα πράττεται ·
whenever the officer in charge is better, the administration of the institution is purer;


8.1.8
4116
ὅταν δὲ χείρων , φαυλότερον .
but when he is worse, the administration is more corrupt.


8.1.8
4117
ἐφοίτων μὲν οὖν ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας Κύρου οἱ ἔντιμοι σὺν τοῖς ἵπποις καὶ ταῖς αἰχμαῖς , συνδόξαν πᾶσι τοῖς ἀρίστοις τῶν συγκαταστρεψαμένων τὴν ἀρχήν .
Accordingly, the nobles came to Cyrus’s court with their horses and their spears, for so it had been decreed by the best of those who with him had made the conquest of the kingdom.


8.1.9
4118
Κῦρος δ’ ἐπὶ μὲν τ- ἄλλα καθίστη ἄλλους ἐπιμελητάς , καὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ καὶ προσόδων ἀποδεκτῆρες καὶ δαπανημάτων δοτῆρες καὶ ἔργων ἐπιστάται καὶ κτημάτων φύλακες καὶ τῶν εἰς τὴν δίαιταν ἐπιτηδείων ἐπιμεληταί ·
Cyrus next appointed officers to have charge of the various departments; for example, tax-collectors, paymasters, boards of public works, keepers of his estates, and stewards of his commissary department.


8.1.9
4119
καὶ ἵππων δὲ καὶ κυνῶν ἐπιμελητὰς καθίστη οὓς ἐνόμιζε καὶ ταῦτα τὰ βοσκήματα βέλτιστ’ ἂν παρέχειν αὑτῷ χρῆσθαι .
He appointed also as superintendents of his horses and hounds those who he thought would keep these creatures in a condition most efficient for his use.


8.1.10
4120
οὓς δὲ συμφύλακας τῆς εὐδαιμονίας οἱ ᾤετο χρῆναι ἔχειν , τούτους ὅπως ὡς βέλτιστοι ἔσοιντο οὐκέτι τούτου τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν ἄλλοις προσέταττεν , ἀλλ’ αὑτοῦ ἐνόμιζε τοῦτο ἔργον εἶναι .
But he did not in the same way leave to others the precaution of seeing that those whom he thought he ought to have as his associates in establishing the permanence of his success should be the ablest men available,


8.1.10
4121
ᾔδει γὰρ ὅτι , εἴ τι μάχης ποτὲ δεήσοι , ἐκ τούτων αὐτῷ καὶ παραστάτας καὶ ἐπιστάτας ληπτέον εἴη , σὺν οἷσπερ οἱ μέγιστοι κίνδυνοι ·
but he considered that this responsibility was his own.


8.1.10
4122
καὶ ταξιάρχους δὲ καὶ πεζῶν καὶ ἱππέων ἐγίγνωσκεν ἐκ τούτων καταστατέον εἶναι .
For he knew that if ever there should be occasion for fighting, he would then have to select from their number men to stand beside and behind him, men in whose company also he would have to meet the greatest dangers; from their number likewise he knew that he would have to appoint his captains both of foot and of horse.


8.1.11
4123
εἰ δὲ δέοι καὶ στρατηγῶν που ἄνευ αὐτοῦ , ᾔδει ὅτι ἐκ τούτων πεμπτέον εἴη ·
Besides, if generals should be needed where he himself could not be, he knew that they would have to be commissioned from among that same number.


8.1.11
4124
καὶ πόλεων δὲ καὶ ὅλων ἐθνῶν φύλαξι καὶ σατράπαις ᾔδει ὅτι τούτων τισὶν εἴη χρηστέον καὶ πρέσβεις γε τούτων τινὰς πεμπτέον , ὅπερ ἐν τοῖς μεγίστοις ἡγεῖτο εἶναι εἰς τὸ ἄνευ πολέμου τυγχάνειν ὧν δέοιτο .
And he knew that he must employ some of these to be governors and satraps of cities or of whole nations, and that he must send others on embassies — an office which he considered of the very first importance for obtaining without war whatever he might want.


8.1.12
4125
μὴ ὄντων μὲν οὖν οἵων δεῖ δι’ ὧν αἱ μέγισται καὶ πλεῖσται πράξεις ἔμελλον εἶναι , κακῶς ἡγεῖτο τὰ αὑτοῦ ἕξειν .
If, therefore, those by whom the most numerous and most important affairs of state were to be transacted were not what they ought to be, he thought that his government would be a failure.


8.1.12
4126
εἰ δ’ οὗτοι εἶεν οἵους δέοι , πάντα ἐνόμιζε καλῶς ἔσεσθαι .
But if they were all that they ought to be, he believed that everything would succeed.


8.1.12
4127
ἐνέδυ μὲν οὖν οὕτω γνοὺς εἰς ταύτην τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν ·
In this conviction, therefore, he took upon himself this charge;


8.1.12
4128
ἐνόμιζε δὲ τὴν αὐτὴν καὶ αὑτῷ ἄσκησιν εἶναι τῆς ἀρετῆς .
and he determined that the same practice of virtue should be his as well.


8.1.12
4129
οὐ γὰρ ᾤετο οἷόν τε εἶναι μὴ αὐτόν τινα ὄντα οἷον δεῖ ἄλλους παρορμᾶν ἐπὶ τὰ καλὰ καὶ ἀγαθὰ ἔργα .
For he thought that it was not possible for him to incite others to good and noble deeds, if he were not himself such as he ought to be.


8.1.13
4130
ὡς δὲ ταῦτα διενοήθη , ἡγήσατο σχολῆς πρῶτον δεῖν , εἰ μέλλοι δυνήσεσθαι τῶν κρατίστων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
When he had arrived at this conclusion, he thought, first of all, that he needed leisure if he were to be able to confine his attention to affairs of paramount importance.


8.1.13
4131
τὸ μὲν οὖν προσόδων ἀμελεῖν οὐχ οἷόν τε ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι , προνοῶν ὅτι πολλὰ καὶ τελεῖν ἀνάγκη ἔσοιτο εἰς μεγάλην ἀρχήν ·
He decided, then, that it was out of the question for him to neglect the revenues, for he foresaw that there would necessarily be enormous expenses connected with a vast empire;


8.1.13
4132
τὸ δ’ αὖ πολλῶν κτημάτων ὄντων ἀμφὶ ταῦτα αὐτὸν ἀεὶ ἔχειν ᾔδει ὅτι ἀσχολίαν παρέξοι τῆς τῶν ὅλων σωτηρίας ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
and on the other hand, he knew that for him to be constantly engaged in giving his personal attention to his manifold possessions would leave him with no time to care for the welfare of the whole realm.


8.1.14
4133
οὕτω δὴ σκοπῶν , ὅπως ἂν τά τε οἰκονομικὰ καλῶς ἔχοι καὶ ἡ σχολὴ γένοιτο , κατενόησέ πως τὴν στρατιωτικὴν σύνταξιν .
As he thus pondered how the business of administration might be successfully conducted and how he still might have the desired leisure, he somehow happened to think of his military organization:


8.1.14
4134
ὡς γὰρ τὰ πολλὰ δεκάδαρχοι μὲν δεκαδέων ἐπιμέλονται , λοχαγοὶ δὲ δεκαδάρχων , χιλίαρχοι δὲ λοχαγῶν , μυρίαρχοι δὲ χιλιάρχων , καὶ οὕτως οὐδεὶς ἀτημέλητος γίγνεται , οὐδ’ ἢν πάνυ πολλαὶ μυριάδες ἀνθρώπων ὦσι , καὶ ὅταν ὁ στρατηγὸς βούληται χρήσασθαί τι τῇ στρατιᾷ , ἀρκεῖ ἢν τοῖς μυριάρχοις παραγγείλῃ ·
in general, the sergeants care for the ten men under them, the lieutenants for the sergeants, the colonels for the lieutenants, the generals for the colonels, and thus no one is uncared for, even though there be many brigades;


8.1.15
4135
ὥσπερ οὖν ταῦτ’ ἔχει , οὕτω καὶ ὁ Κῦρος συνεκεφαλαιώσατο τὰς οἰκονομικὰς πράξεις ·
and when the commander-in-chief wishes to do anything with his army, it is sufficient for him to issue his commands only to his brigadier-generals.


8.1.15
4136
ὥστε καὶ τῷ Κύρῳ ἐγένετο ὀλίγοις διαλεγομένῳ μηδὲν τῶν οἰκείων ἀτημελήτως ἔχειν ·
On this same model, then, Cyrus centralized the administrative functions also.


8.1.15
4137
καὶ ἐκ τούτου ἤδη σχολὴν ἦγε πλείω ἢ ἄλλος μιᾶς οἰκίας καὶ μιᾶς νεὼς ἐπιμελούμενος .
And so it was possible for him, by communicating with only a few officers, to have no part of his administration uncared for.


8.1.15
4138
οὕτω δὴ καταστησάμενος τὸ αὑτοῦ ἐδίδαξε καὶ τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν ταύτῃ τῇ καταστάσει χρῆσθαι .
In this way he now enjoyed more leisure than one who has care of a single household or a single ship.


8.1.16
4139
τὴν μὲν δὴ σχολὴν οὕτω κατεσκευάσατο αὑτῷ τε καὶ τοῖς περὶ αὐτόν , ἤρχετο δ’ ἐπιστατεῖν τοῦ εἶναι οἵους δεῖ τοὺς κοινῶνας .
When he had thus organized his own functions in the government, he instructed those about him to follow the same plan of organization.


8.1.16
4140
πρῶτον μὲν ὁπόσοι ὄντες ἱκανοὶ ἄλλων ἐργαζομένων τρέφεσθαι μὴ παρεῖεν ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας , τούτους ἐπεζήτει , νομίζων τοὺς μὲν παρόντας οὐκ ἂν ἐθέλειν οὔτε κακὸν οὔτε αἰσχρὸν οὐδὲν πράττειν καὶ διὰ τὸ παρ’ ἄρχοντι εἶναι καὶ διὰ τὸ εἰδέναι ὅτι ὁρῷντ’ ἂν ὅ τι πράττοιεν ὑπὸ τῶν βελτίστων ·
In this way, then, he secured leisure for himself and for his ministers; and then he began to take measures that his associates in power should be such as they ought to be.


8.1.16
4141
οἳ δὲ μὴ παρεῖεν , τούτους ἡγεῖτο ἢ ἀκρατείᾳ τινὶ ἢ ἀδικίᾳ ἢ ἀμελείᾳ ἀπεῖναι .
In the first place, if any of those who were able to live by the labours of others failed to attend at court, he made inquiry after them; for he thought that those who came would not be willing to do anything dishonourable or immoral, partly because they were in the presence of their sovereign and partly also because they knew that, whatever they did, they would be under the eyes of the best men there;


8.1.17
4142
τοῦτο οὖν πρῶτον διηγησόμεθα ὡς προσηνάγκαζε τοὺς τοιούτους παρεῖναι .
whereas, in the case of those who did not, come he believed that they absented themselves because they were guilty of some form of intemperance or injustice or neglect of duty.


8.1.17
4143
τῶν γὰρ παρ’ ἑαυτῷ μάλιστα φίλων ἐκέλευσεν ἄν τινα λαβεῖν τὰ τοῦ μὴ φοιτῶντος , φάσκοντα λαμβάνειν τὰ ἑαυτοῦ .
We will describe first, therefore, the manner in which he obliged all such to come;


8.1.17
4144
ἐπεὶ οὖν τοῦτο γένοιτο , ἧκον ἂν εὐθὺς οἱ στερόμενοι ὡς ἠδικημένοι .
he would direct some one of the best friends he had at court to seize some of the property of the man who did not present himself and to declare that he was taking only what was his own.


8.1.18
4145
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος πολὺν μὲν χρόνον οὐκ ἐσχόλαζε τοῖς τοιούτοις ὑπακούειν ·
So, whenever this happened, those who lost their effects would come to him to complain that they had been wronged.


8.1.18
4146
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀκούσειεν αὐτῶν , πολὺν χρόνον ἀνεβάλλετο τὴν διαδικασίαν .
Cyrus, however, would not be at leisure for a long time to give such men a hearing,


8.1.18
4147
ταῦτα δὲ ποιῶν ἡγεῖτο προσεθίζειν αὐτοὺς θεραπεύειν , ἧττον δὲ ἐχθρῶς ἢ εἰ αὐτὸς κολάζων ἠνάγκαζε παρεῖναι .
and when he did give them a hearing he would postpone the trial for a long time.


8.1.19
4148
εἷς μὲν τρόπος διδασκαλίας ἦν αὐτῷ οὗτος τοῦ παρεῖναι ·
By so doing he thought he would accustom them to pay their court and that he would thus excite less ill-feeling than he would if he compelled them to come by imposing penalties.


8.1.19
4149
ἄλλος δὲ τὸ τὰ ῥᾷστα καὶ κερδαλεώτατα τοῖς παροῦσι προστάττειν ·
That was one of his methods of training them to attend.


8.1.19
4150
ἄλλος δὲ τὸ μηδέν ποτε τοῖς ἀποῦσι νέμειν ·
Another was to give those who did attend the easiest and the most profitable employment; and another was never to distribute any favours among those who failed to attend.


8.1.20
4151
ὁ δὲ δὴ μέγιστος τρόπος τῆς ἀνάγκης ἦν , εἰ τούτων μηδέν τις ὑπακούοι , ἀφελόμενος ἂν τοῦτον ἃ ἔχοι ἄλλῳ ἐδίδου ὃν ᾤετο δύνασθαι ἂν ἐν τῷ δέοντι παρεῖναι ·
But the surest way of compulsion was this: if a man paid no attention to any of these three methods, he would take away all that he had and give it to some one else who he thought would present himself when he was wanted;


8.1.20
4152
καὶ οὕτως ἐγίγνετο αὐτῷ φίλος χρήσιμος ἀντὶ ἀχρήστου .
and thus he would get a useful friend in exchange for a useless one.


8.1.20
4153
ἐπιζητεῖ δὲ καὶ ὁ νῦν βασιλεύς , ἤν τις ἀπῇ οἷς παρεῖναι καθήκει .
And the king to-day likewise makes inquiries if any one absents himself whose duty it is to be present.


8.1.21
4154
τοῖς μὲν δὴ μὴ παροῦσιν οὕτω προσεφέρετο .
Thus, then, he dealt with those who failed to attend at court.


8.1.21
4155
τοὺς δὲ παρέχοντας ἑαυτοὺς ἐνόμισε μάλιστ’ ἂν ἐπὶ τὰ καλὰ καὶ ἀγαθὰ ἐπαίρειν , ἐπείπερ ἄρχων ἦν αὐτῶν , εἰ αὐτὸς ἑαυτὸν ἐπιδεικνύειν πειρῷτο τοῖς ἀρχομένοις πάντων μάλιστα κεκοσμημένον τῇ ἀρετῇ .
But in those who did present themselves he believed that he could in no way more effectively inspire a desire for the beautiful and the good than by endeavouring, as their sovereign, to set before his subjects a perfect model of virtue in his own person.


8.1.22
4156
αἰσθάνεσθαι μὲν γὰρ ἐδόκει καὶ διὰ τοὺς γραφομένους νόμους βελτίους γιγνομένους ἀνθρώπους ·
For he thought he perceived that men are made better through even the written law,


8.1.22
4157
τὸν δὲ ἀγαθὸν ἄρχοντα βλέποντα νόμον ἀνθρώποις ἐνόμισεν , ὅτι καὶ τάττειν ἱκανός ἐστι καὶ ὁρᾶν τὸν ἀτακτοῦντα καὶ κολάζειν .
while the good ruler he regarded as a law with eyes for men, because he is able not only to give commandments but also to see the transgressor and punish him.


8.1.23
4158
οὕτω δὴ γιγνώσκων πρῶτον μὲν τὰ περὶ τοὺς θεοὺς μᾶλλον ἐκπονοῦντα ἐπεδείκνυεν ἑαυτὸν ἐν τούτῳ τῷ χρόνῳ , ἐπεὶ εὐδαιμονέστερος ἦν .
In this conviction, he showed himself in the first place more devout in his worship of the gods, now that he was more fortunate;


8.1.23
4159
καὶ τότε πρῶτον κατεστάθησαν οἱ μάγοι G? ὑμνεῖν τε ἀεὶ ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοὺς θεοὺς καὶ θύειν ἀν’ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν οἷς οἱ μάγοι θεοῖς εἴποιεν .
and then for the first time the college of magi was instituted... and he never failed to sing hymns to the gods at daybreak and to sacrifice daily to whatsoever deities the magi directed.


8.1.24
4160
οὕτω δὴ τὰ τότε κατασταθέντα ἔτι καὶ νῦν διαμένει παρὰ τῷ ἀεὶ ὄντι βασιλεῖ .
Thus the institutions established by him at that time have continued in force with each successive king even to this day.


8.1.24
4161
ταῦτ’ οὖν πρῶτον ἐμιμοῦντο αὐτὸν καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Πέρσαι , νομίζοντες καὶ αὐτοὶ εὐδαιμονέστεροι ἔσεσθαι , ἢν θεραπεύωσι τοὺς θεούς , ὥσπερ ὁ εὐδαιμονέστατός τε ὢν καὶ ἄρχων ·
In this respect, therefore, the rest of the Persians also imitated him from the first; for they believed that they would be more sure of good fortune if they revered the gods just as he did who was their sovereign and the most fortunate of all;


8.1.24
4162
καὶ Κύρῳ δ’ ἂν ἡγοῦντο ταῦτα ποιοῦντες ἀρέσκειν .
and they thought also that in doing this they would please Cyrus.


8.1.25
4163
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος τὴν τῶν μεθ’ αὑτοῦ εὐσέβειαν καὶ ἑαυτῷ ἀγαθὸν ἐνόμιζε , λογιζόμενος ὥσπερ οἱ πλεῖν αἱρούμενοι μετὰ τῶν εὐσεβῶν μᾶλλον ἢ μετὰ τῶν ἠσεβηκέναι τι δοκούντων .
And Cyrus considered that the piety of his friends was a good thing for him, too;


8.1.25
4164
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἐλογίζετο ὡς εἰ πάντες οἱ κοινῶνες θεοσεβεῖς εἶεν , ἧττον ἂν αὐτοὺς ἐθέλειν περί τε ἀλλήλους ἀνόσιόν τι ποιεῖν καὶ περὶ ἑαυτόν , εὐεργέτης νομίζων εἶναι τῶν κοινώνων .
for he reasoned as they do who prefer, when embarking on a voyage, to set sail with pious companions rather than with those who are believed to have committed some impiety. And besides, he reasoned that if all his associates were god-fearing men, they would be less inclined to commit crime against one another or against himself, for he considered himself their benefactor;


8.1.26
4165
ἐμφανίζων δὲ καὶ τοῦτο ὅτι περὶ πολλοῦ ἐποιεῖτο μηδένα μήτε φίλον ἀδικεῖν μήτε σύμμαχον , ἀλλὰ τὸ δίκαιον ἰσχυρῶς ἀθρῶν , μᾶλλον καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ᾤετ’ ἂν τῶν μὲν αἰσχρῶν κερδῶν ἀπέχεσθαι , διὰ τοῦ δικαίου δ’ ἐθέλειν πορεύεσθαι .
and if he made it plain how important he held it to be to wrong no one of his friends or allies, and if he always paid scrupulous regard to what was upright, others also, he thought, would be more likely to abstain from improper gains and to endeavour to make their way by upright methods.


8.1.27
4166
καὶ αἰδοῦς δ’ ἂν ἡγεῖτο μᾶλλον πάντας ἐμπιμπλάναι , εἰ αὐτὸς φανερὸς εἴη πάντας οὕτως αἰδούμενος ὡς μήτ’ εἰπεῖν ἂν μήτε ποιῆσαι μηδὲν αἰσχρόν .
And he thought that he should be more likely to inspire in all respect for others, if he himself were seen to show such respect for all as not to say or do anything improper.


8.1.28
4167
ἐτεκμαίρετο δὲ τοῦτο οὕτως ἕξειν ἐκ τοῦδε .
And that this would be the result he concluded from the following observation:


8.1.28
4168
μὴ γὰρ ὅτι ἄρχοντα , ἀλλὰ καὶ οὓς οὐ φοβοῦνται , μᾶλλον τοὺς αἰδουμένους αἰδοῦνται τῶν ἀναιδῶν οἱ ἄνθρωποι ·
people have more respect for those who have such respect for others than they have for those who have not; they show it toward even those whom they do not fear — to say nothing of what they would show toward their kings;


8.1.28
4169
καὶ γυναῖκας δὲ ἃς ἂν αἰδουμένας αἰσθάνωνται , ἀνταιδεῖσθαι μᾶλλον ἐθέλουσιν ὁρῶντες .
and women also whom they see showing respect for others they are more inclined to look upon in turn with respect.


8.1.29
4170
τὸ δ’ αὖ πείθεσθαι οὕτω μάλιστ’ ἂν ᾤετο ἔμμονον εἶναι τοῖς περὶ αὐτόν , εἰ τοὺς ἀπροφασίστως πειθομένους φανερὸς εἴη μᾶλλον τιμῶν τῶν τὰς μεγίστας ἀρετὰς καὶ ἐπιπονωτάτας δοκούντων παρέχεσθαι .
And again, obedience he thought would be most deeply impressed upon his attendants, if he showed that he honoured those who unhesitatingly obeyed more than those who thought they exhibited the greatest and most elaborate virtues. And thus he continued throughout to judge and to act.


8.1.30
4171
γιγνώσκων δ’ οὕτω καὶ ποιῶν διετέλει .
And by making his own self-control an example, he disposed all to practise that virtue more diligently.


8.1.30
4172
καὶ σωφροσύνην δ’ αὑτοῦ ἐπιδεικνὺς μᾶλλον ἐποίει καὶ ταύτην πάντας ἀσκεῖν .
For when the weaker members of society see that one who is in a position where he may indulge himself to excess is still under self-control,


8.1.30
4173
ὅταν γὰρ ὁρῶσιν , ᾧ μάλιστα ἔξεστιν ὑβρίζειν , τοῦτον σωφρονοῦντα , οὕτω μᾶλλον οἵ γε ἀσθενέστεροι ἐθέλουσιν οὐδὲν ὑβριστικὸν ποιοῦντες φανεροὶ εἶναι .
they naturally strive all the more not to be found guilty of any excessive indulgence.


8.1.31
4174
διῄρει δὲ αἰδῶ καὶ σωφροσύνην τῇδε , ὡς τοὺς μὲν αἰδουμένους τὰ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ αἰσχρὰ φεύγοντας , τοὺς δὲ σώφρονας καὶ τὰ ἐν τῷ ἀφανεῖ .
Moreover, he distinguished between considerateness and self-control in this way: the considerate are those who avoid what is offensive when seen; the self-controlled avoid that which is offensive, even when unseen.


8.1.32
4175
καὶ ἐγκράτειαν δὲ οὕτω μάλιστ’ ἂν ᾤετο ἀσκεῖσθαι , εἰ αὐτὸς ἐπιδεικνύοι ἑαυτὸν μὴ ὑπὸ τῶν παραυτίκα ἡδονῶν ἑλκόμενον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀγαθῶν , ἀλλὰ προπονεῖν ἐθέλοντα πρῶτον σὺν τῷ καλῷ τῶν εὐφροσυνῶν .
And he thought that temperance could be best inculcated, if he showed that he himself was never carried away from the pursuit of the good by any pleasures of the moment, but that he was willing to labour first for the attainment of refined pleasures.


8.1.33
4176
τοιγαροῦν τοιοῦτος ὢν ἐποίησεν ἐπὶ ταῖς θύραις πολλὴν μὲν τῶν χειρόνων εὐταξίαν , ὑπεικόντων τοῖς ἀμείνοσι , πολλὴν δ’ αἰδῶ καὶ εὐκοσμίαν πρὸς ἀλλήλους .
To sum up, then, by setting such an example Cyrus secured at court great correctness of conduct on the part of his subordinates, who gave precedence to their superiors;


8.1.33
4177
ἐπέγνως δ’ ἂν ἐκεῖ οὐδένα οὔτε ὀργιζόμενον κραυγῇ οὔτε χαίροντα ὑβριστικῷ γέλωτι , ἀλλὰ ἰδὼν ἂν αὐτοὺς ἡγήσω τῷ ὄντι εἰς κάλλος ζῆν .
and thus he also secured from them a great degree of respect and politeness toward one another. And among them you would never have detected any one raising his voice in anger or giving vent to his delight in boisterous laughter; but on seeing them you would have judged that they were in truth making a noble life their aim.


8.1.34
4178
τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ ποιοῦντες καὶ ὁρῶντες ἐπὶ θύραις διῆγον .
Such was what they did and such what they witnessed day by day at court.


8.1.34
4179
τῆς πολεμικῆς δ’ ἕνεκα ἀσκήσεως ἐπὶ θήραν ἐξῆγεν οὕσπερ ἀσκεῖν ταῦτα ᾤετο χρῆναι , ταύτην ἡγούμενος καὶ ὅλως ἀρίστην ἄσκησιν πολεμικῶν εἶναι , καὶ ἱππικῆς δὲ ἀληθεστάτην .
With a view to training in the arts of war, Cyrus used to take out hunting those who he thought ought to have such practice, for he held that this was altogether the best training in military science and also the truest in horsemanship.


8.1.35
4180
καὶ γὰρ ἐπόχους ἐν παντοδαποῖς χωρίοις αὕτη μάλιστα ἀποδείκνυσι διὰ τὸ θηρίοις φεύγουσιν ἐφέπεσθαι , καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἵππων ἐνεργοὺς αὕτη μάλιστα ἀπεργάζεται διὰ τὴν τοῦ λαμβάνειν φιλοτιμίαν καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν ·
For it is the exercise best adapted to give riders a firm seat in all sorts of places, because they have to pursue the animals wherever they may run; and it is also the best exercise to make them active on horseback because of their rivalry and eagerness to get the game.


8.1.36
4181
καὶ τὴν ἐγκράτειαν δὲ καὶ πόνους καὶ ψύχη καὶ θάλπη καὶ λιμὸν καὶ δίψος δύνασθαι φέρειν ἐνταῦθα μάλιστα προσείθιζε τοὺς κοινῶνας .
By this same exercise, too, he was best able to accustom his associates to temperance and the endurance of hardship, to heat and cold, to hunger and thirst.


8.1.36
4182
καὶ νῦν δ’ ἔτι βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι οἱ περὶ βασιλέα ταῦτα ποιοῦντες διατελοῦσιν .
And even to this day the king and the rest that make up his retinue continue to engage in the same sport.


8.1.37
4183
ὅτι μὲν οὖν οὐκ ᾤετο προσήκειν οὐδενὶ ἀρχῆς ὅστις μὴ βελτίων εἴη τῶν ἀρχομένων καὶ τοῖς προειρημένοις πᾶσι δῆλον , καὶ ὅτι οὕτως ἀσκῶν τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν πολὺ μάλιστα αὐτὸς ἐξεπόνει καὶ τὴν ἐγκράτειαν καὶ τὰς πολεμικὰς τέχνας καὶ τὰς μελέτας .
From all that has been said, therefore, it is evident that he believed that no one had any right to rule who was not better than his subjects; and it is evident, too, that in thus drilling those about him he himself got his own best training both in temperance and in the arts and pursuits of war.


8.1.38
4184
καὶ γὰρ ἐπὶ θήραν τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ἐξῆγεν , ὁπότε μὴ μένειν ἀνάγκη τις εἴη ·
For he not only used to take the others out hunting, whenever there was no need of his staying at home,


8.1.38
4185
αὐτὸς δὲ καὶ ὁπότε ἀνάγκη εἴη , οἴκοι ἐθήρα τὰ ἐν τοῖς παραδείσοις θηρία τρεφόμενα ·
but even when there was some need of his staying at home, he would himself hunt the animals that were kept in the parks.


8.1.38
4186
καὶ οὔτ’ αὐτός ποτε πρὶν ἱδρῶσαι δεῖπνον ᾑρεῖτο οὔτε ἵπποις ἀγυμνάστοις σῖτον ἐνέβαλλε ·
And he never dined without first having got himself into a sweat, nor would he have any food given to his horses without their having first been duly exercised;


8.1.38
4187
συμπαρεκάλει δὲ καὶ εἰς ταύτην τὴν θήραν τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν σκηπτούχους .
and to these hunts he would invite also the mace-bearers in attendance upon him.


8.1.39
4188
τοιγαροῦν πολὺ μὲν αὐτὸς διέφερεν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς καλοῖς ἔργοις , πολὺ δὲ οἱ περὶ ἐκεῖνον , διὰ τὴν ἀεὶ μελέτην .
The result of all this constant training was that he and his associates greatly excelled in all manly exercises.


8.1.39
4189
παράδειγμα μὲν δὴ τοιοῦτον ἑαυτὸν παρείχετο .
Such an example did he furnish by his own personal conduct.


8.1.39
4190
πρὸς δὲ τούτῳ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων οὕστινας μάλιστα ὁρῴη τὰ καλὰ διώκοντας , τούτους καὶ δώροις καὶ ἀρχαῖς καὶ ἕδραις καὶ πάσαις τιμαῖς ἐγέραιρεν ·
And besides this, he used to reward with gifts and positions of authority and seats of honour and all sorts of preferment others whom he saw devoting themselves most eagerly to the attainment of excellence;


8.1.39
4191
ὥστε πολλὴν πᾶσι φιλοτιμίαν ἐνέβαλλεν ὅπως ἕκαστος ὅτι ἄριστος φανήσοιτο Κύρῳ .
and thus he inspired in all an earnest ambition, each striving to appear as deserving as he could in the eyes of Cyrus.


8.1.40
4192
καταμαθεῖν δὲ τοῦ Κύρου δοκοῦμεν ὡς οὐ τούτῳ μόνῳ ἐνόμιζε χρῆναι τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν ἀρχομένων διαφέρειν , τῷ βελτίονας αὐτῶν εἶναι , ἀλλὰ καὶ καταγοητεύειν ᾤετο χρῆναι αὐτούς .
We think, furthermore, that we have observed in Cyrus that he held the opinion that a ruler ought to excel his subjects not only in point of being actually better than they, but that he ought also to cast a sort of spell upon them.


8.1.40
4193
στολήν τε γοῦν εἵλετο τὴν Μηδικὴν αὐτός τε φορεῖν καὶ τοὺς κοινῶνας ταύτην ἔπεισεν ἐνδύεσθαι ·
At any rate, he chose to wear the Median dress himself and persuaded his associates also to adopt it;


8.1.40
4194
— αὕτη γὰρ αὐτῷ συγκρύπτειν ἐδόκει εἴ τίς τι ἐν τῷ σώματι ἐνδεὲς ἔχοι , καὶ καλλίστους καὶ μεγίστους ἐπιδεικνύναι τοὺς φοροῦντας ·
for he thought that if any one had any personal defect, that dress would help to conceal it, and that it made the wearer look very tall and very handsome.


8.1.41
4195
καὶ γὰρ τὰ ὑποδήματα τοιαῦτα ἔχουσιν ἐν οἷς μάλιστα λαθεῖν ἔστι καὶ ὑποτιθεμένους τι , ὥστε δοκεῖν μείζους εἶναι ἢ εἰσί ·
For they have shoes of such a form that without being detected the wearer can easily put something into the soles so as to make him look taller than he is.


8.1.41
4196
— καὶ ὑποχρίεσθαι δὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς προσίετο , ὡς εὐοφθαλμότεροι φαίνοιντο ἢ εἰσί , καὶ ἐντρίβεσθαι , ὡς εὐχροώτεροι ὁρῷντο ἢ πεφύκασιν .
He encouraged also the fashion of pencilling the eyes, that they might seem more lustrous than they are, and of using cosmetics to make the complexion look better than nature made it.


8.1.42
4197
ἐμελέτησε δὲ καὶ ὡς μὴ πτύοντες μηδὲ ἀπομυττόμενοι φανεροὶ εἶεν , μηδὲ μεταστρεφόμενοι ἐπὶ θέαν μηδενός , ὡς οὐδὲν θαυμάζοντες .
He trained his associates also not to spit or to wipe the nose in public, and not to turn round to look at anything, as being men who wondered at nothing.


8.1.42
4198
πάντα δὲ ταῦτα ᾤετο φέρειν τι εἰς τὸ δυσκαταφρονητοτέρους φαίνεσθαι τοῖς ἀρχομένοις .
All this he thought contributed, in some measure, to their appearing to their subjects men who could not lightly be despised.


8.1.43
4199
οὓς μὲν δὴ ἄρχειν ᾤετο χρῆναι , δι’ ἑαυτοῦ οὕτω κατεσκεύασε καὶ μελέτῃ καὶ τῷ σεμνῶς προεστάναι αὐτῶν ·
Those, therefore, who he thought ought to be in authority he thus prepared in his own school by careful training as well as by the respect which he commanded as their leader;


8.1.43
4200
οὓς δ’ αὖ κατεσκεύαζεν εἰς τὸ δουλεύειν , τούτους οὔτε μελετᾶν τῶν ἐλευθερίων πόνων οὐδένα παρώρμα οὔθ’ ὅπλα κεκτῆσθαι ἐπέτρεπεν ·
those, on the other hand, whom he was training to be servants he did not encourage to practise any of the exercises of freemen; neither did he allow them to own weapons;


8.1.43
4201
ἐπεμελεῖτο δὲ ὅπως μήτε ἄσιτοι μήτε ἄποτοί ποτε ἔσοιντο ἐλευθερίων ἕνεκα μελετημάτων .
but he took care that they should not suffer any deprivation in food or drink on account of the exercises in which they served the freemen.


8.1.44
4202
καὶ γὰρ ὁπότε ἐλαύνοιεν τὰ θηρία τοῖς ἱππεῦσιν εἰς τὰ πεδία , φέρεσθαι σῖτον εἰς θήραν τούτοις ἐπέτρεπε , τῶν δὲ ἐλευθέρων οὐδενί ·
And he managed it in this way: whenever they were to drive the animals down into the plains for the horsemen, he allowed those of the lower classes, but none of the freemen, to take food with them on the hunt;


8.1.44
4203
καὶ ὁπότε πορεία εἴη , ἦγεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὰ ὕδατα ὥσπερ τὰ ὑποζύγια .
and whenever there was an expedition to make, he would lead the serving men to water, just as he did the beasts of burden.


8.1.44
4204
καὶ ὁπότε δὲ ὥρα εἴη ἀρίστου , ἀνέμενεν αὐτοὺς ἔστ’ ἐμφάγοιέν τι , ὡς μὴ βουλιμιῷεν ·
And again, when it was time for luncheon, he would wait for them until they could get something to eat, so that they should not get so ravenously hungry.


8.1.44
4205
ὥστε καὶ οὗτοι αὐτὸν ὥσπερ οἱ ἄριστοι πατέρα ἐκάλουν , ὅτι ἐπεμέλετο αὐτῶν ὅπως ἀναμφιλόγως ἀεὶ ἀνδράποδα διατελοῖεν .
And so this class also called him father, just as the nobles did, for he provided for them well so that they might spend all their lives as slaves, without a protest.


8.1.45
4206
τῇ μὲν δὴ ὅλῃ Περσῶν ἀρχῇ οὕτω τὴν ἀσφάλειαν κατεσκεύαζεν .
Thus he secured for the whole Persian empire the necessary stability;


8.1.45
4207
αὑτῷ δὲ ὅτι μὲν οὐχ ὑπὸ τῶν καταστραφέντων κίνδυνος εἴη παθεῖν τι ἰσχυρῶς ἐθάρρει ·
and as for himself, he was perfectly confident that there was no danger of his suffering aught at the hands of those whom he had subdued.


8.1.45
4208
καὶ γὰρ ἀνάλκιδας ἡγεῖτο εἶναι αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀσυντάκτους ὄντας ἑώρα , καὶ πρὸς τούτοις οὐδ’ ἐπλησίαζε τούτων οὐδεὶς αὐτῷ οὔτε νυκτὸς οὔτε ἡμέρας .
And the ground of his confidence was this — that he believed them to be powerless and he saw that they were unorganized; and besides that, not one of them came near him either by night or by day.


8.1.46
4209
οὓς δὲ κρατίστους τε ἡγεῖτο καὶ ὡπλισμένους καὶ ἁθρόους ὄντας ἑώρα — καὶ τοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν ᾔδει ἱππέων ἡγεμόνας ὄντας , τοὺς δὲ πεζῶν ·
But there were some whom he considered very powerful and whom he saw well armed and well organized;


8.1.46
4210
πολλοὺς δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ φρονήματα ἔχοντας ᾐσθάνετο ὡς ἱκανοὺς ὄντας ἄρχειν ·
and some of them, he knew, had cavalry under their command, others infantry;


8.1.46
4211
καὶ τοῖς φύλαξι δὲ αὐτοῦ οὗτοι μάλιστα ἐπλησίαζον , καὶ αὐτῷ δὲ τῷ Κύρῳ τούτων πολλοὶ πολλάκις συνεμίγνυσαν ·
and he was aware that many of them had the assurance to think that they were competent to rule; and these not only came in very close touch with his guards but many of them came frequently in contact with Cyrus himself,


8.1.46
4212
ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἦν , ὅ τι καὶ χρῆσθαι ἔμελλεν αὐτοῖς — ὑπὸ τούτων οὖν καὶ κίνδυνος ἦν αὐτὸν μάλιστα παθεῖν τι κατὰ πολλοὺς τρόπους .
and this was unavoidable if he was to make any use of them — this, then, was the quarter from which there was the greatest danger that something might happen to him in any one of many ways.


8.1.47
4213
σκοπῶν οὖν ὅπως ἂν αὐτῷ καὶ τὰ ἀπὸ τούτων ἀκίνδυνα γένοιτο , τὸ μὲν περιελέσθαι αὐτῶν τὰ ὅπλα καὶ ἀπολέμους ποιῆσαι ἀπεδοκίμασε , καὶ ἄδικον ἡγούμενος καὶ κατάλυσιν τῆς ἀρχῆς ταύτην νομίζων ·
So, as he cast about in his mind how to remove any danger that might arise from them also, he rejected the thought of disarming them and making them incapable of war;


8.1.47
4214
τὸ δ’ αὖ μὴ προσίεσθαι αὐτοὺς καὶ τὸ ἀπιστοῦντα φανερὸν εἶναι ἀρχὴν ἡγήσατο πολέμου ·
for he decided that that would be unjust, and besides he thought that this would be destruction to his empire. On the other hand, he believed that to refuse to admit them to his presence or to show that he mistrusted them would lead at once to hostilities.


8.1.48
4215
ἓν δὲ ἀντὶ πάντων τούτων ἔγνω καὶ κράτιστον εἶναι πρὸς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀσφάλειαν καὶ κάλλιστον , εἰ δύναιτο ποιῆσαι τοὺς κρατίστους ἑαυτῷ μᾶλλον φίλους ἢ ἀλλήλοις .
But better than any of these ways, he recognized that there was one course that would be at once the most honourable and the most conducive to his own personal security,


8.1.48
4216
ὡς οὖν ἐπὶ τὸ φιλεῖσθαι δοκεῖ ἡμῖν ἐλθεῖν , τοῦτο πειρασόμεθα διηγήσασθαι .
and that was, if possible, to make those powerful nobles better friends to himself than to one another.


8.2.1
4217
πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ διὰ παντὸς ἀεὶ τοῦ χρόνου φιλανθρωπίαν τῆς ψυχῆς ὡς ἐδύνατο μάλιστα ἐνεφάνιζεν , ἡγούμενος , ὥσπερ οὐ ῥᾴδιόν ἐστι φιλεῖν τοὺς μισεῖν δοκοῦντας οὐδ’ εὐνοεῖν τοῖς κακόνοις , οὕτω καὶ τοὺς γνωσθέντας ὡς φιλοῦσι καὶ εὐνοοῦσιν , οὐκ ἂν δύνασθαι μισεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν φιλεῖσθαι ἡγουμένων .
In the first place, then, he showed at all times as great kindness of heart as he could; for he believed that just as it is not easy to love those who seem to hate us, or to cherish good-will toward those who bear us ill-will, in the same way those who are known to love and to cherish good-will could not be hated by those who believe themselves loved.


8.2.2
4218
ἕως μὲν οὖν χρήμασιν ἀδυνατώτερος ἦν εὐεργετεῖν , τῷ τε προνοεῖν τῶν συνόντων καὶ τῷ προπονεῖν καὶ τῷ συνηδόμενος μὲν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς φανερὸς εἶναι , συναχθόμενος δ’ ἐπὶ τοῖς κακοῖς , τούτοις ἐπειρᾶτο τὴν φιλίαν θηρεύειν ·
During the time, therefore, when he was not yet quite able to do favours through gifts of money, he tried to win the love of those about him by taking forethought for them and labouring for them and showing that he rejoiced with them in their good fortune and sympathized with them in their mishaps;


8.2.2
4219
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ ὥστε χρήμασιν εὐεργετεῖν , δοκεῖ ἡμῖν γνῶναι πρῶτον μὲν ὡς εὐεργέτημα ἀνθρώποις πρὸς ἀλλήλους οὐδέν ἐστιν ἀπὸ τῆς αὐτῆς δαπάνης ἐπιχαριτώτερον ἢ σίτων καὶ ποτῶν μετάδοσις .
and after he found himself in a position to do favours with money, he seems to us to have recognized from the start that there is no kindness which men can show one another, with the same amount of expenditure, more acceptable than sharing meat and drink with them.


8.2.3
4220
τοῦτο δ’ οὕτω νομίσας πρῶτον μὲν ἐπὶ τὴν αὑτοῦ τράπεζαν συνέταξεν ὅπως οἷς αὐτὸς σιτοῖτο σίτοις , τούτοις ὅμοια ἀεὶ παρατίθοιτο αὐτῷ ἱκανὰ παμπόλλοις ἀνθρώποις ·
In this belief, he first of all arranged that there should be placed upon his own table a quantity of food, like that of which he himself regularly partook, sufficient for a very large number of people;


8.2.3
4221
ὅσα δὲ παρατεθείη , ταῦτα πάντα , πλὴν οἷς αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ σύνδειπνοι χρήσαιντο , διεδίδου οἷς δὴ βούλοιτο τῶν φίλων μνήμην ἐνδείκνυσθαι ἢ φιλοφροσύνην .
and all of that which was served to him, except what he and his companions at table consumed, he distributed among those of his friends to whom he wished to send remembrances or good wishes.


8.2.3
4222
διέπεμπε δὲ καὶ τούτοις οὓς ἀγασθείη ἢ ἐν φυλακαῖς ἢ ἐν θεραπείαις ἢ ἐν αἱστισινοῦν πράξεσιν , ἐνσημαινόμενος τοῦτο , ὅτι οὐκ ἂν λανθάνοιεν χαρίζεσθαι βουλόμενοι .
And he used to send such presents around to those also whose services on garrison duty or in attendance upon him or in any other way met with his approval; in this way he let them see that he did not fail to observe their wish to please him.


8.2.4
4223
ἐτίμα δὲ καὶ τῶν οἰκετῶν ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης ὁπότε τινὰ ἐπαινέσειε ·
He used also to honour with presents from his table any one of his servants whom he took occasion to commend;


8.2.4
4224
καὶ τὸν πάντα δὲ σῖτον τῶν οἰκετῶν ἐπὶ τὴν αὑτοῦ τράπεζαν ἐπετίθετο , οἰόμενος ὥσπερ καὶ τοῖς κυσὶν ἐμποιεῖν τινα καὶ τοῦτο εὔνοιαν .
and he had all of his servants’ food served from his own table, for he thought that this would implant in them a certain amount of good-will, just as it does in dogs.


8.2.4
4225
εἰ δὲ καὶ θεραπεύεσθαί τινα βούλοιτο τῶν φίλων ὑπὸ πολλῶν , καὶ τούτοις ἔπεμπεν ἀπὸ τραπέζης ·
And if he wished to have any one of his friends courted by the multitude, to such a one he would send presents from his table.


8.2.4
4226
καὶ νῦν γὰρ ἔτι οἷς ἂν ὁρῶσι πεμπόμενα ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλέως τραπέζης , τούτους πάντες μᾶλλον θεραπεύουσι , νομίζοντες αὐτοὺς ἐντίμους εἶναι καὶ ἱκανοὺς διαπράττειν , ἤν τι δέωνται .
And that device proved effective; for even to this day everybody pays more diligent court to those to whom they see things sent from the royal table; for they think that such persons must be in high favour and in a position to secure for them anything they may want.


8.2.4
4227
ἔτι δὲ καὶ οὐ τούτων μόνον ἕνεκα τῶν εἰρημένων εὐφραίνει τὰ πεμπόμενα παρὰ βασιλέως , ἀλλὰ τῷ ὄντι καὶ ἡδονῇ πολὺ διαφέρει τὰ ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλέως τραπέζης .
Moreover, it is not for these reasons only that that which is sent by the king gives delight, but the food that is sent from the king’s board really is much superior in the gratification also that it gives.


8.2.5
4228
καὶ τοῦτο μέντοι οὕτως ἔχειν οὐδέν τι θαυμαστόν ·
That this, however, should be so is no marvel.


8.2.5
4229
ὥσπερ γὰρ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι τέχναι διαφερόντως ἐν ταῖς μεγάλαις πόλεσιν ἐξειργασμέναι εἰσί , κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον καὶ τὰ παρὰ βασιλεῖ σῖτα πολὺ διαφερόντως ἐκπεπόνηται .
For just as all other arts are developed to superior excellence in large cities, in that same way the food at the king’s palace is also elaborately prepared with superior excellence.


8.2.5
4230
ἐν μὲν γὰρ ταῖς μικραῖς πόλεσιν οἱ αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσι κλίνην , θύραν , ἄροτρον , τράπεζαν , πολλάκις δ’ ὁ αὐτὸς οὗτος καὶ οἰκοδομεῖ , καὶ ἀγαπᾷ ἢν καὶ οὕτως ἱκανοὺς αὐτὸν τρέφειν ἐργοδότας λαμβάνῃ ·
For in small towns the same workman makes chairs and doors and plows and tables, and often this same artisan builds houses, and even so he is thankful if he can only find employment enough to support him.


8.2.5
4231
ἀδύνατον οὖν πολλὰ τεχνώμενον ἄνθρωπον πάντα καλῶς ποιεῖν .
And it is, of course, impossible for a man of many trades to be proficient in all of them.


8.2.5
4232
ἐν δὲ ταῖς μεγάλαις πόλεσι διὰ τὸ πολλοὺς ἑκάστου δεῖσθαι ἀρκεῖ καὶ μία ἑκάστῳ τέχνη εἰς τὸ τρέφεσθαι ·
In large cities, on the other hand, inasmuch as many people have demands to make upon each branch of industry, one trade alone,


8.2.5
4233
πολλάκις δὲ οὐδ’ ὅλη μία ·
and very often even less than a whole trade, is enough to support a man:


8.2.5
4234
ἀλλ’ ὑποδήματα ποιεῖ ὁ μὲν ἀνδρεῖα , ὁ δὲ γυναικεῖα ·
one man, for instance, makes shoes for men, and another for women;


8.2.5
4235
ἔστι δὲ ἔνθα καὶ ὑποδήματα ὁ μὲν νευρορραφῶν μόνον τρέφεται , ὁ δὲ σχίζων , ὁ δὲ χιτῶνας μόνον συντέμνων , ὁ δέ γε τούτων οὐδὲν ποιῶν ἀλλὰ συντιθεὶς ταῦτα .
and there are places even where one man earns a living by only stitching shoes, another by cutting them out, another by sewing the uppers together,  while there is another who performs none of these operations but only assembles the parts.


8.2.5
4236
ἀνάγκη οὖν τὸν ἐν βραχυτάτῳ διατρίβοντα ἔργῳ τοῦτον καὶ ἄριστα δὴ ἠναγκάσθαι τοῦτο ποιεῖν .
It follows, therefore, as a matter of course, that he who devotes himself to a very highly specialized line of work is bound to do it in the best possible manner.


8.2.6
4237
τὸ αὐτὸ δὲ τοῦτο πέπονθε καὶ τὰ ἀμφὶ τὴν δίαιταν .
Exactly the same thing holds true also in reference to the kitchen:


8.2.6
4238
ᾧ μὲν γὰρ ὁ αὐτὸς κλίνην στρώννυσι , τράπεζαν κοσμεῖ , μάττει , ὄψα ἄλλοτε ἀλλοῖα ποιεῖ , ἀνάγκη οἶμαι τούτῳ , ὡς ἂν ἕκαστον προχωρῇ , οὕτως ἔχειν ·
in any establishment where one and the same man arranges the dining couches, lays the table, bakes the bread, prepares now one sort of dish and now another, he must necessarily have things go as they may;


8.2.6
4239
ὅπου δὲ ἱκανὸν ἔργον ἑνὶ ἕψειν κρέα , ἄλλῳ ὀπτᾶν , ἄλλῳ δὲ ἰχθὺν ἕψειν , ἄλλῳ ὀπτᾶν , ἄλλῳ ἄρτους ποιεῖν , καὶ μηδὲ τούτους παντοδαπούς , ἀλλ’ ἀρκεῖ ἂν ἓν εἶδος εὐδοκιμοῦν παρέχῃ , ἀνάγκη οἶμαι καὶ ταῦτα οὕτω ποιούμενα πολὺ διαφερόντως ἐξειργάσθαι ἕκαστον .
but where it is all one man can do to stew meats and another to roast them, for one man to boil fish and another to bake them, for another to make bread and not every sort at that, but where it suffices if he makes one kind that has a high reputation — everything that is prepared in such a kitchen will, I think, necessarily be worked out with superior excellence.


8.2.7
4240
τῇ μὲν δὴ τῶν σίτων θεραπείᾳ τοιαῦτα ποιῶν πολὺ ὑπερεβάλλετο πάντας ·
Accordingly, Cyrus far surpassed all others in the art of making much of his friends by gifts of food.


8.2.7
4241
ὡς δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις πᾶσι θεραπεύων πολὺ ἐκράτει , τοῦτο νῦν διηγήσομαι ·
And how he far surpassed in every other way of courting favour, I will now explain.


8.2.7
4242
πολὺ γὰρ διενεγκὼν ἀνθρώπων τῷ πλείστας προσόδους λαμβάνειν πολὺ ἔτι πλέον διήνεγκε τῷ πλεῖστα ἀνθρώπων δωρεῖσθαι .
Though he far exceeded all other men in the amount of the revenues he received, yet he excelled still more in the quantity of presents he made.


8.2.7
4243
κατῆρξε μὲν οὖν τούτου Κῦρος , διαμένει δ’ ἔτι καὶ νῦν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν ἡ πολυδωρία .
It was Cyrus, therefore, who began the practice of lavish giving, and among the kings it continues even to this day.


8.2.8
4244
τίνι μὲν γὰρ φίλοι πλουσιώτεροι ὄντες φανεροὶ ἢ Περσῶν βασιλεῖ ;
For who has richer friends to show than the Persian king?


8.2.8
4245
τίς δὲ κοσμῶν κάλλιον φαίνεται στολαῖς τοὺς περὶ αὑτὸν ἢ βασιλεύς ;
Who is there that is known to adorn his friends with more beautiful robes than does the king?


8.2.8
4246
τίνος δὲ δῶρα γιγνώσκεται ὥσπερ ἔνια τῶν βασιλέως , ψέλια καὶ στρεπτοὶ καὶ ἵπποι χρυσοχάλινοι ;
Whose gifts are so readily recognized as some of those which the king gives, such as bracelets, necklaces, and horses with gold-studded bridles?


8.2.8
4247
οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἔξεστιν ἐκεῖ ταῦτα ἔχειν ᾧ ἂν μὴ βασιλεὺς δῷ .
For, as everybody knows, no one over there is allowed to have such things except those to whom the king has given them.


8.2.9
4248
τίς δ’ ἄλλος λέγεται δώρων μεγέθει ποιεῖν αἱρεῖσθαι αὑτὸν καὶ ἀντ’ ἀδελφῶν καὶ ἀντὶ πατέρων καὶ ἀντὶ παίδων ;
And of whom else is it said that by the munificence of his gifts he makes himself preferred above even brothers and parents and children?


8.2.9
4249
τίς δ’ ἄλλος ἐδυνάσθη ἐχθροὺς ἀπέχοντας πολλῶν μηνῶν ὁδὸν τιμωρεῖσθαι ὡς Περσῶν βασιλεύς ;
Who else was ever in a position like the Persian king to punish enemies who were distant a journey of many months?


8.2.9
4250
τίς δ’ ἄλλος καταστρεψάμενος ἀρχὴν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχομένων πατὴρ καλούμενος ἀπέθανεν ἢ Κῦρος ;
And who, besides Cyrus, ever gained an empire by conquestand even to his death was called father by the people he had subdued?


8.2.9
4251
τοῦτο δὲ τ- ὄνομα δῆλον ὅτι εὐεργετοῦντός ἐστι μᾶλλον ἢ ἀφαιρουμένου .
For that name obviously belongs to a benefactor rather than to a despoiler.


8.2.10
4252
κατεμάθομεν δὲ ὡς καὶ τοὺς βασιλέως καλουμένους ὀφθαλμοὺς καὶ τὰ βασιλέως ὦτα οὐκ ἄλλως ἐκτήσατο ἢ τῷ δωρεῖσθαί τε καὶ τιμᾶν ·
Moreover, we have discovered that he acquired the so-called king’s eyes and king’s ears in no other way than by bestowing presents and honours;


8.2.10
4253
τοὺς γὰρ ἀπαγγείλαντας ὅσα καιρὸς αὐτῷ εἴη πεπύσθαι μεγάλως εὐεργετῶν πολλοὺς ἐποίησεν ἀνθρώπους καὶ ὠτακουστεῖν καὶ διοπτεύειν τί ἂν ἀγγείλαντες ὠφελήσειαν βασιλέα .
for by rewarding liberally those who reported to him whatever it was to his interest to hear, he prompted many men to make it their business to use their eyes and ears to spy out what they could report to the king to his advantage.


8.2.11
4254
ἐκ τούτου δὴ καὶ πολλοὶ ἐνομίσθησαν βασιλέως ὀφθαλμοὶ καὶ πολλὰ ὦτα .
As a natural result of this, many eyes and many ears were ascribed to the king.


8.2.11
4255
εἰ δέ τις οἴεται ἕνα αἱρετὸν εἶναι ὀφθαλμὸν βασιλεῖ , οὐκ ὀρθῶς οἴεται ·
But if any one thinks that the king selected one man to be his eye, he is wrong;


8.2.11
4256
ὀλίγα γὰρ εἷς γ’ ἂν ἴδοι καὶ εἷς ἀκούσειε ·
for one only would see and one would hear but little;


8.2.11
4257
καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ὥσπερ ἀμελεῖν ἂν παρηγγελμένον εἴη , εἰ ἑνὶ τοῦτο προστεταγμένον εἴη ·
and it would have amounted to ordering all the rest to pay no attention, if one only had been appointed to see and hear.


8.2.11
4258
πρὸς δὲ καὶ ὅντινα γιγνώσκοιεν ὀφθαλμὸν ὄντα , τοῦτον ἂν εἰδεῖεν ὅτι φυλάττεσθαι δεῖ .
Besides, if people knew that a certain man was the eye, they would know that they must beware of him.


8.2.11
4259
ἀλλ’ οὐχ οὕτως ἔχει , ἀλλὰ τοῦ φάσκοντος ἀκοῦσαί τι ἢ ἰδεῖν ἄξιον ἐπιμελείας παντὸς βασιλεὺς ἀκούει .
But such is not the case; for the king listens to anybody who may claim to have heard or seen anything worthy of attention.


8.2.12
4260
οὕτω δὴ πολλὰ μὲν βασιλέως ὦτα , πολλοὶ δ’ ὀφθαλμοὶ νομίζονται ·
And thus the saying comes about, The king has many ears and many eyes;


8.2.12
4261
καὶ φοβοῦνται πανταχοῦ λέγειν τὰ μὴ σύμφορα βασιλεῖ , ὥσπερ αὐτοῦ ἀκούοντος , καὶ ποιεῖν ἃ μὴ σύμφορα , ὥσπερ αὐτοῦ παρόντος .
and people are everywhere afraid to say anything to the discredit of the king, just as if he himself were listening; or to do anything to harm him, just as if he were present.


8.2.12
4262
οὔκουν ὅπως μνησθῆναι ἄν τις ἐτόλμησε πρός τινα περὶ Κύρου φλαῦρόν τι , ἀλλ’ ὡς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς πᾶσι καὶ ὠσὶ βασιλέως τοῖς ἀεὶ παροῦσιν οὕτως ἕκαστος διέκειτο .
Not only, therefore, would no one have ventured to say anything derogatory of Cyrus to any one else, but every one conducted himself at all times just as if those who were within hearing were so many eyes and ears of the king.


8.2.12
4263
τὸ δὲ οὕτω διακεῖσθαι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ οἶδα ὅ τι ἄν τις αἰτιάσαιτο μᾶλλον ἢ ὅτι μεγάλα ἤθελεν ἀντὶ μικρῶν εὐεργετεῖν .
I do not know what better reason any one could assign for this attitude toward him on the part of people generally than that it was his policy to do large favours in return for small ones.


8.2.13
4264
καὶ τὸ μὲν δὴ μεγέθει δώρων ὑπερβάλλειν πλουσιώτατον ὄντα οὐ θαυμαστόν ·
That he, the richest man of all, should excel in the munificence of his presents is not surprising;


8.2.13
4265
τὸ δὲ τῇ θεραπείᾳ καὶ τῇ ἐπιμελείᾳ τῶν φίλων βασιλεύοντα περιγίγνεσθαι , τοῦτο ἀξιολογώτερον .
but for him, the king, to exceed all others in thoughtful attention to his friends and in care for them, that is more remarkable;


8.2.13
4266
ἐκεῖνος τοίνυν λέγεται κατάδηλος εἶναι μηδενὶ ἂν οὕτως αἰσχυνθεὶς ἡττώμενος ὡς φίλων θεραπείᾳ ·
and it is said to have been no secret that there was nothing wherein he would have been so much ashamed of being outdone as in attention to his friends.


8.2.14
4267
καὶ λόγος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἀπομνημονεύεται ὡς λέγοι παραπλήσια ἔργα εἶναι νομέως ἀγαθοῦ καὶ βασιλέως ἀγαθοῦ ·
People quote a remark of his to the effect that the duties of a good shepherd and of a good king were very much alike;


8.2.14
4268
τόν τε γὰρ νομέα χρῆναι ἔφη εὐδαίμονα τὰ κτήνη ποιοῦντα χρῆσθαι αὐτοῖς , ἣ δὴ προβάτων εὐδαιμονία , τόν τε βασιλέα ὡσαύτως εὐδαίμονας πόλεις καὶ ἀνθρώπους ποιοῦντα χρῆσθαι αὐτοῖς .
a good shepherd ought, while deriving benefit from his flocks, to make them happy (so far as sheep can be said to have happiness), and in the same way a king ought to make his people and his cities happy, if he would derive benefits from them.


8.2.14
4269
οὐδὲν οὖν θαυμαστόν , εἴπερ ταύτην εἶχε τὴν γνώμην , τὸ φιλονίκως ἔχειν πάντων ἀνθρώπων θεραπείᾳ περιγίγνεσθαι .
Seeing that he held this theory, it is not at all surprising that he was ambitious to surpass all other men in attention to his friends.


8.2.15
4270
καλὸν δ’ ἐπίδειγμα καὶ τοῦτο λέγεται Κῦρος ἐπιδεῖξαι Κροίσῳ , ὅτε ἐνουθέτει αὐτὸν ὡς διὰ τὸ πολλὰ διδόναι πένης ἔσοιτο , ἐξὸν αὐτῷ θησαυροὺς χρυσοῦ πλείστους ἑνί γε ἀνδρὶ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ καταθέσθαι ·
And, among other proofs, Cyrus  is said to have given Croesus one splendid practical demonstration of the correctness of this theory, when the latter warned him that by giving so much away he would make himself poor, whereas he was in a position to lay up in his house more treasures of gold than any other man.   And how much gold, pray,  Cyrus  is said to have asked,  do you think I should have by this time, if I had been amassing it, as you propose, ever since I have been in power?


8.2.16
4271
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον λέγεται ἐρέσθαι ·
And Croesus is said to have asked Cyrus:


8.2.16
4272
καὶ πόσα ἂν ἤδη οἴει μοι χρήματα εἶναι , εἰ συνέλεγον χρυσίον ὥσπερ σὺ κελεύεις ἐξ ὅτου ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ εἰμι ;
And how much money do you think I should have by this time, if I had been amassing it from the time I came to the throne?


8.2.16
4273
καὶ τὸν Κροῖσον εἰπεῖν πολύν τινα ἀριθμόν .
And Croesus named some large sum.


8.2.16
4274
καὶ τὸν Κῦρον πρὸς ταῦτα , ἄγε δή , φάναι , ὦ Κροῖσε , σύμπεμψον ἄνδρα σὺν Ὑστάσπᾳ τουτῳῒ ὅτῳ σὺ πιστεύεις μάλιστα .
Well, then, Croesus, said Cyrus in reply, send along with Hystaspas here a man in whom you have most confidence.


8.2.16
4275
σὺ δέ , ὦ Ὑστάσπα , ἔφη , περιελθὼν πρὸς τοὺς φίλους λέγε αὐτοῖς ὅτι δέομαι χρυσίου πρὸς πρᾶξίν τινα ·
And you, Hystaspas, said he to him, go the round of my friends and tell them that I need money for a certain enterprise;


8.2.16
4276
καὶ γὰρ τῷ ὄντι προσδέομαι ·
for, in truth, I do need more.


8.2.16
4277
καὶ κέλευε αὐτοὺς ὁπόσα ἂν ἕκαστος δύνηται πορίσαι μοι χρήματα γράψαντας καὶ κατασημηναμένους δοῦναι τὴν ἐπιστολὴν τῷ Κροίσου θεράποντι φέρειν .
And bid them write down the amount they could each let me have, and affix their seals to each subscription, and give it to Croesus’s messenger to deliver here.


8.2.17
4278
ταῦτα δὲ ὅσα ἔλεγε καὶ γράψας καὶ σημηνάμενος ἐδίδου τῷ Ὑστάσπᾳ φέρειν πρὸς τοὺς φίλους ·
And when he had written down what he had said, he sealed the letter and gave it to Hystaspas to carry to his friends.


8.2.17
4279
ἐνέγραψε δὲ πρὸς πάντας καὶ Ὑστάσπαν ὡς φίλον αὑτοῦ δέχεσθαι .
And he included in it also a request that they all receive Hystaspas as his friend.


8.2.17
4280
ἐπεὶ δὲ περιῆλθε καὶ ἤνεγκεν ὁ Κροίσου θεράπων τὰς ἐπιστολάς , ὁ δὴ Ὑστάσπας εἶπεν ·
And when he had made the round and Croesus’s messenger had brought in the subscriptions, Hystaspas said:


8.2.17
4281
ὦ Κῦρε βασιλεῦ , καὶ ἐμοὶ ἤδη χρὴ ὡς πλουσίῳ χρῆσθαι ·
King Cyrus, you should treat me also henceforth as a rich man;


8.2.17
4282
πάμπολλα γὰρ ἔχων πάρειμι δῶρα διὰ τὰ σὰ γράμματα .
for, thanks to your letter, I have come back with a great number of presents.


8.2.18
4283
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
And Cyrus said:


8.2.18
4284
εἷς μὲν τοίνυν καὶ οὗτος ἤδη θησαυρὸς ἡμῖν , ὦ Κροῖσε ·
So even in this man, Croesus, we have one treasure-house already.


8.2.18
4285
τοὺς δ’ ἄλλους καταθεῶ καὶ λόγισαι πόσα ἐστὶν ἕτοιμα χρήματα , ἤν τι δέωμαι χρῆσθαι .
But as for the rest of my friends, look over the list, and add up the amounts, and see how much money is ready for me, if I need any for my use.


8.2.18
4286
λέγεται δὴ λογιζόμενος ὁ Κροῖσος πολλαπλάσια εὑρεῖν ἢ ἔφη Κύρῳ ἂν εἶναι ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς ἤδη , εἰ συνέλεγεν .
Then Croesus is said to have added it up and to have found that there was many times as much subscribed as he had told Cyrus he should have in his treasury by this time, if he had been amassing it.


8.2.19
4287
ἐπεὶ δὲ τοῦτο φανερὸν ἐγένετο , εἰπεῖν λέγεται ὁ Κῦρος ·
And when this became apparent, Cyrus is said to have remarked:


8.2.19
4288
ὁρᾷς , φάναι , ὦ Κροῖσε , ὡς εἰσὶ καὶ ἐμοὶ θησαυροί ;
Do you observe, Croesus, that I, too, have my treasures?


8.2.19
4289
ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν κελεύεις με παρ’ ἐμοὶ αὐτοὺς συλλέγοντα φθονεῖσθαί τε δι’ αὐτοὺς καὶ μισεῖσθαι , καὶ φύλακας αὐτοῖς ἐφιστάντα μισθοφόρους τούτοις πιστεύειν ·
But you are proposing to me to get them together and hoard them in my palace, to put hired watchmen in charge of everything and to trust to them, and on account of those hoards to be envied and hated.


8.2.19
4290
ἐγὼ δὲ τοὺς φίλους πλουσίους ποιῶν τούτους μοι νομίζω θησαυροὺς καὶ φύλακας ἅμα ἐμοῦ τε καὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων ἀγαθῶν πιστοτέρους εἶναι ἢ εἰ φρουροὺς μισθοφόρους ἐπεστησάμην .
I, on the other hand, believe that if I make my friends rich I shall have treasures in them and at the same time more trusty watchers both of my person and of our common fortunes than any hired guards I could put in charge.


8.2.20
4291
καὶ ἄλλο δέ σοι ἐρῶ ·
And one more thing I must tell you:


8.2.20
4292
ἐγὼ γάρ , ὦ Κροῖσε , ὃ μὲν οἱ θεοὶ δόντες εἰς τὰς ψυχὰς τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐποίησαν ὁμοίως πάντας πένητας , τούτου μὲν οὐδ’ αὐτὸς δύναμαι περιγενέσθαι , ἀλλ’ εἰμὶ ἄπληστος κ- ἐγὼ ὥσπερ οἱ ἄλλοι χρημάτων ·
even I cannot eradicate from myself that passion for wealth which the gods have put into the human soul and by which they have made us all poor alike, but I, too, am as insatiate of wealth as other people are.


8.2.21
4293
τῇδέ γε μέντοι διαφέρειν μοι δοκῶ τῶν πλείστων ὅτι οἱ μὲν ἐπειδὰν τῶν ἀρκούντων περιττὰ κτήσωνται , τὰ μὲν αὐτῶν κατορύττουσι , τὰ δὲ κατασήπουσι , τὰ δὲ ἀριθμοῦντες καὶ μετροῦντες καὶ ἱστάντες καὶ διαψύχοντες καὶ φυλάττοντες πράγματα ἔχουσι , καὶ ὅμως ἔνδον ἔχοντες τοσαῦτα οὔτε ἐσθίουσι πλείω ἢ δύνανται φέρειν , διαρραγεῖεν γὰρ ἄν , οὔτ’ ἀμφιέννυνται πλείω ἢ δύνανται φέρειν , ἀποπνιγεῖεν γὰρ ἄν , ἀλλὰ τὰ περιττὰ χρήματα πράγματα ἔχουσιν ·
However, I think I am different from most people, in that others, when they have acquired more than a sufficiency, bury some of their treasure and allow some to decay, and some they weary themselves with counting, measuring, weighing, airing, and watching; and though they have so much at home, they never eat more than they can hold, for they would burst if they did, and they never wear more than they can carry, for they would be suffocated if they  they only find their superfluous treasure a burden.


8.2.21
4294
ἐγὼ δ’ ὑπηρετῶ μὲν τοῖς θεοῖς καὶ ὀρέγομαι ἀεὶ πλειόνων ·
But I follow the leading of the gods and am always grasping after more.


8.2.22
4295
ἐπειδὰν δὲ κτήσωμαι , ἃ ἂν ἴδω περιττὰ ὄντα τῶν ἐμοὶ ἀρκούντων , τούτοις τάς τ’ ἐνδείας τῶν φίλων ἐξακοῦμαι καὶ πλουτίζων καὶ εὐεργετῶν ἀνθρώπους εὔνοιαν ἐξ αὐτῶν κτῶμαι καὶ φιλίαν , καὶ ἐκ τούτων καρποῦμαι ἀσφάλειαν καὶ εὔκλειαν ·
But when I have obtained what I see is more than enough for my needs, I use it to satisfy the wants of my friends; and by enriching men and doing them kindnesses I win with my superfluous wealth their friendship and loyalty, and from that I reap as my reward security and good fame —


8.2.22
4296
ἃ οὔτε κατασήπεται οὔτε ὑπερληροῦντα λυμαίνεται , ἀλλὰ ἡ εὔκλεια ὅσῳ ἂν πλείων ᾖ , τοσούτῳ καὶ μείζων καὶ καλλίων καὶ κουφοτέρα φέρειν γίγνεται , πολλάκις δὲ καὶ τοὺς φέροντας αὐτὴν κουφοτέρους παρέχεται .
possessions that never decay or do injury from overloading the recipient; but the more one has of good fame, the greater and more attractive and lighter to bear it becomes, and often, too, it makes those who bear it lighter of heart.


8.2.23
4297
ὅπως δὲ καὶ τοῦτο εἰδῇς , ἔφη , ὦ Κροῖσε , ἐγὼ οὐ τοὺς πλεῖστα ἔχοντας καὶ φυλάττοντας πλεῖστα εὐδαιμονεστάτους ἡγοῦμαι ·
And let me tell you, Croesus, he continued, I do not consider those the happiest who have the most and keep guard of the most;


8.2.23
4298
οἱ γὰρ τὰ τείχη φυλάττοντες οὕτως ἂν εὐδαιμονέστατοι εἴησαν ·
for if that were so, those would be the happiest who keep guard on the city walls,


8.2.23
4299
πάντα γὰρ τὰ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι φυλάττουσιν ·
for they keep guard of everything in the city.


8.2.23
4300
ἀλλ’ ὃς ἂν κτᾶσθαί τε πλεῖστα δύνηται σὺν τῷ δικαίῳ καὶ χρῆσθαι πλείστοις σὺν τῷ καλῷ , τοῦτον ἐγὼ εὐδαιμονέστατον νομίζω καὶ τὰ χρήματα .
But the one who can honestly acquire the most and use the most to noble ends, him I count most happy.


8.2.23
4301
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δὴ φανερὸς ἦν ὥσπερ ἔλεγε καὶ πράττων .
And it was evident that he practised what he preached.


8.2.24
4302
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις κατανοήσας τοὺς πολλοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὅτι ἢν μὲν ὑγιαίνοντες διατελῶσι , παρασκευάζονται ὅπως ἕξουσι τὰ ἐπιτήδεια καὶ κατατίθενται τὰ χρήσιμα εἰς τὴν τῶν ὑγιαινόντων δίαιταν ·
Besides this, he had observed that most people in days of health and strength make preparations that they may have the necessaries of life, and they lay up for themselves what will serve to supply the wants of healthy people;


8.2.24
4303
ὅπως δὲ ἢν ἀσθενήσωσι τὰ σύμφορα παρέσται , τούτου οὐ πάνυ ἐπιμελομένους ἑώρα ·
but he saw that they made no provision at all for such things as would be serviceable in case of sickness.


8.2.24
4304
ἔδοξεν οὖν καὶ ταῦτα ἐκπονῆσαι αὐτῷ , καὶ ἰατρούς τε τοὺς ἀρίστους συνεκομίσατο πρὸς αὑτὸν τῷ τελεῖν ἐθέλειν καὶ ὁπόσα ἢ ὄργανα χρήσιμα ἔφη τις ἂν αὐτῶν γενέσθαι ἢ φάρμακα ἢ σῖτα ἢ ποτά , οὐδὲν τούτων ὅ τι οὐχὶ παρασκευάσας ἐθησαύριζε παρ’ αὑτῷ .
He resolved, therefore, to work out these problems, and to that end he spared no expense to collect about him the very best physicians and surgeons and all the instruments and drugs and articles of food and drink that any one of them said would be useful — there were none of these things that he did not procure and keep in store at his palace.


8.2.25
4305
καὶ ὁπότε δέ τις ἀσθενήσειε τῶν θεραπεύεσθαι ἐπικαιρίων , ἐπεσκόπει καὶ παρεῖχε πάντα ὅτου ἔδει .
And whenever any one fell sick in whose recovery he was interested, he would visit him and provide for him whatever was needed.


8.2.25
4306
καὶ τοῖς ἰατροῖς δὲ χάριν ᾔδει , ὁπότε τις ἰάσαιτό τινα τῶν παρ’ ἐκείνου λαμβάνων .
And he was grateful to the physicians also, whenever any of them took any of his medical stores and with them effected a cure.


8.2.26
4307
ταῦτα μὲν δὴ καὶ τοιαῦτα πολλὰ ἐμηχανᾶτο πρὸς τὸ πρωτεύειν παρ’ οἷς ἐβούλετο ἑαυτὸν φιλεῖσθαι .
These and many other such arts he employed in order to hold the first place in the affections of those by whom he wished to be beloved.


8.2.26
4308
ὧν δὲ προηγόρευέ τε ἀγῶνας καὶ ἆθλα προυτίθει , φιλονικίας ἐμποιεῖν βουλόμενος περὶ τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν ἔργων , ταῦτα τῷ μὲν Κύρῳ ἔπαινον παρεῖχεν ὅτι ἐπεμέλετο ὅπως ἀσκοῖτο ἡ ἀρετή ·
And the games, in which Cyrus used to announce contests and to offer prizes from a desire to inspire in his people a spirit of emulation in what was beautiful and good — these games also brought him praise, because his aim was to secure practice in excellence.


8.2.26
4309
τοῖς μέντοι ἀρίστοις οἱ ἀγῶνες οὗτοι πρὸς ἀλλήλους καὶ ἔριδας καὶ φιλονικίας ἐνέβαλλον .
But these contests also stirred up contentions and jealousies among the nobles.


8.2.27
4310
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ὥσπερ νόμον κατεστήσατο ὁ Κῦρος , ὅσα διακρίσεως δέοιτο εἴτε δίκῃ εἴτε ἀγωνίσματι , τοὺς δεομένους διακρίσεως συντρέχειν τοῖς κριταῖς .
Besides this, Cyrus had made a regulation that was practically a law, that, in any matter that required adjudication, whether it was a civil action or a contest for a prize, those who asked for such adjudication must concur in the choice of judges.


8.2.27
4311
δῆλον οὖν ὅτι ἐστοχάζοντο μὲν οἱ ἀνταγωνιζόμενοί τι ἀμφότεροι τῶν κρατίστων καὶ τῶν μάλιστα φίλων κριτῶν ·
It was, therefore, a matter of course that each of the contestants aimed to secure the most influential men as judges and such as were most friendly to himself.


8.2.27
4312
ὁ δὲ μὴ νικῶν τοῖς μὲν νικῶσιν ἐφθόνει , τοὺς δὲ μὴ ἑαυτὸν κρίνοντας ἐμίσει ·
The one who did not win was always jealous of those who did, and disliked those of the judges who did not vote in his favour;


8.2.27
4313
ὁ δ’ αὖ νικῶν τῷ δικαίῳ προσεποιεῖτο νικᾶν , ὥστε χάριν οὐδενὶ ἡγεῖτο ὀφείλειν .
on the other hand, the one who did win claimed that he had won by virtue of the justice of his cause, and so he thought he owed no thanks to anybody.


8.2.28
4314
καὶ οἱ πρωτεύειν δὲ βουλόμενοι φιλίᾳ παρὰ Κύρῳ , ὥσπερ ἄλλοι ἐν πόλεσι , καὶ οὗτοι ἐπιφθόνως πρὸς ἀλλήλους εἶχον , ὥσθ’ οἱ πλείονες ἐκποδὼν ἐβούλοντο ὁ ἕτερος τὸν ἕτερον γενέσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ συνέπραξαν ἄν τι ἀλλήλοις ἀγαθόν .
And those also who wished to hold the first place in the affections of Cyrus were jealous of one another, just like other people (even in republics), so that in most cases the one would have wished to get the other out of the way sooner than to join with him in any work to their mutual interest.


8.2.28
4315
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δεδήλωται ὡς ἐμηχανᾶτο τοὺς κρατίστους αὐτὸν μᾶλλον πάντας φιλεῖν ἢ ἀλλήλους .
Thus it has been shown how he contrived that the most influential citizens should love him more than they did each other.


8.3.1
4316
νῦν δὲ ἤδη διηγησόμεθα ὡς τὸ πρῶτον ἐξήλασε Κῦρος ἐκ τῶν βασιλείων ·
Next we shall describe how Cyrus for the first time drove forth in state from his palace;


8.3.1
4317
καὶ γὰρ αὐτῆς τῆς ἐξελάσεως ἡ σεμνότης ἡμῖν δοκεῖ μία τῶν τεχνῶν εἶναι τῶν μεμηχανημένων τὴν ἀρχὴν μὴ εὐκαταφρόνητον εἶναι .
and that is in place here, for the magnificence of his appearance in state seems to us to have been one of the arts that he devised to make his government command respect.


8.3.1
4318
πρῶτον μὲν οὖν πρὸ τῆς ἐξελάσεως εἰσκαλέσας πρὸς αὑτὸν τοὺς τὰς ἀρχὰς ἔχοντας Περσῶν τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων συμμάχων διέδωκεν αὐτοῖς τὰς Μηδικὰς στολάς ·
Accordingly, before he started out, he called to him those of the Persians and of the allies who held office, and distributed Median robes among them


8.3.1
4319
καὶ τότε πρῶτον Πέρσαι Μηδικὴν στολὴν ἐνέδυσαν ·
(and this was the first time that the Persians put on the Median robe);


8.3.1
4320
διαδιδούς τε ἅμα τάδε ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἐλάσαι βούλοιτο εἰς τὰ τεμένη τὰ τοῖς θεοῖς ἐξῃρημένα καὶ θῦσαι μετ’ ἐκείνων .
and as he distributed them he said that he wished to proceed in state to the sanctuaries that had been selected for the gods, and to offer sacrifice there with his friends.


8.3.2
4321
πάρεστε οὖν , ἔφη , ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας κοσμηθέντες ταῖς στολαῖς ταύταις πρὶν ἥλιον ἀνατέλλειν , καὶ καθίστασθε ὡς ἂν ὑμῖν Φεραύλας ὁ Πέρσης ἐξαγγείλῃ παρ’ ἐμοῦ ·
Come, therefore, to court before sunrise, dressed in these robes, said he, and form in line as Pheraulas, the Persian, shall direct in my name;


8.3.2
4322
καὶ ἐπειδάν , ἔφη , ἐγὼ ἡγῶμαι , ἕπεσθε ἐν τῇ ῥηθείσῃ χώρᾳ .
and when I lead the way, follow me in the order assigned to you.


8.3.2
4323
ἢν δ’ ἄρα τινὶ δοκῇ ὑμῶν ἄλλῃ κάλλιον εἶναι ἢ ὡς ἂν νῦν ἐλαύνωμεν , ἐπειδὰν πάλιν ἔλθωμεν , διδασκέτω με ·
But if any one of you thinks that some other way would be better than that in which we shall now proceed, let him inform me as soon as we return,


8.3.2
4324
ὅπῃ γὰρ ἂν κάλλιστον καὶ ἄριστον ὑμῖν δοκῇ εἶναι , ταύτῃ ἕκαστα δεῖ καταστήσασθαι .
for everything must be arranged as you think best and most becoming.


8.3.3
4325
ἐπεὶ δὲ τοῖς κρατίστοις διέδωκε τὰς καλλίστας στολάς , ἐξέφερε δὴ καὶ ἄλλας Μηδικὰς στολάς , παμπόλλας γὰρ παρεσκευάσατο , οὐδὲν φειδόμενος οὔτε πορφυρίδων οὔτε ὀρφνίνων οὔτε φοινικίδων οὔτε καρυκίνων ἱματίων ·
And when he had distributed among the noblest the most beautiful garments, he brought out other Median robes, for he had had a great many made, with no stint of purple or sable or red or scarlet or crimson cloaks.


8.3.3
4326
νείμας δὲ τούτων τὸ μέρος ἑκάστῳ τῶν ἡγεμόνων ἐκέλευσεν αὐτοὺς τούτοις κοσμεῖν τοὺς αὑτῶν φίλους , ὥσπερ , ἔφη , ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς κοσμῶ .
He apportioned to each one of his officers his proper share of them, and he bade them adorn their friends with them, just as I, said he, have been adorning you.


8.3.4
4327
καί τις τῶν παρόντων ἐπήρετο αὐτόν ·
And you, Cyrus, asked one of those present, when will you adorn yourself?


8.3.4
4328
σὺ δέ , ὦ Κῦρε , ἔφη , πότε κοσμήσῃ ;
Why, do I not seem to you to be adorned myself when I adorn you?


8.3.4
4329
ὁ δ’ ἀπεκρίνατο ·
he answered.


8.3.4
4330
οὐ γὰρ νῦν , ἔφη , δοκῶ ὑμῖν αὐτὸς κοσμεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς κοσμῶν ;
Be sure that if I can treat you, my friends, properly, I shall look well,


8.3.4
4331
ἀμέλει , ἔφη , ἢν δύνωμαι ὑμᾶς τοὺς φίλους εὖ ποιεῖν , ὁποίαν ἂν ἔχων στολὴν τυγχάνω , ἐν ταύτῃ καλὸς φανοῦμαι .
no matter what sort of dress I happen to have on.


8.3.5
4332
οὕτω δὴ οἱ μὲν ἀπελθόντες μεταπεμπόμενοι τοὺς φίλους ἐκόσμουν ταῖς στολαῖς .
So they went away, sent for their friends, and adorned them with the robes.


8.3.5
4333
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος νομίζων Φεραύλαν τὸν ἐκ τῶν δημοτῶν καὶ συνετὸν εἶναι καὶ φιλόκαλον καὶ εὔτακτον καὶ τοῦ χαρίζεσθαι αὐτῷ οὐκ ἀμελῆ , ὅς ποτε καὶ περὶ τοῦ τιμᾶσθαι ἕκαστον κατὰ τὴν ἀξίαν συνεῖπε , τοῦτον δὴ καλέσας συνεβουλεύετο αὐτῷ πῶς ἂν τοῖς μὲν εὔνοις κάλλιστα ἰδεῖν ποιοῖτο τὴν ἐξέλασιν , τοῖς δὲ δυσμενέσι φοβερώτατα .
Now Cyrus believed Pheraulas, that man of the common people, to be intelligent, to have an eye for beauty and order, and to be not indisposed to please him; (this was the same Pheraulas who had once supported his proposal that each man should be honoured in accordance with his merit;) so he called him in and with him planned how to arrange the procession in a manner that should prove most splendid in the eyes of his loyal friends and most intimidating to those who were disaffected.


8.3.6
4334
ἐπεὶ δὲ σκοπούντοιν αὐτοῖν τ- αὐτὰ συνέδοξεν , ἐκέλευσε τὸν Φεραύλαν ἐπιμεληθῆναι ὅπως ἂν οὕτω γένηται αὔριον ἡ ἐξέλασις ὥσπερ ἔδοξε καλῶς ἔχειν .
And when after careful study they agreed on the arrangement, he bade Pheraulas see that the procession take place on the morrow exactly as they had decided was best.


8.3.6
4335
εἴρηκα δέ , ἔφη , ἐγὼ πάντας πείθεσθαί σοι περὶ τῆς ἐν τῇ ἐξελάσει τάξεως ·
And I have issued orders, said he, that everybody shall obey you in regard to the ordering of the procession;


8.3.6
4336
ὅπως δ’ ἂν ἥδιον παραγγέλλοντός σου ἀκούωσι , φέρε λαβών , ἔφη , χιτῶνας μὲν τουτουσὶ τοῖς τῶν δορυφόρων ἡγεμόσι , κασᾶς δὲ τούσδε τοὺς ἐφιππίους τοῖς τῶν ἱππέων ἡγεμόσι δός , καὶ τῶν ἁρμάτων τοῖς ἡγεμόσιν ἄλλους τούσδε χιτῶνας .
but, in order that they may the more readily follow your directions, take these tunics here and give them to the officers of the lancers, and these cavalry mantles here to the commanders of the horse; and give the officers of the chariot forces also these other tunics.


8.3.7
4337
ὁ μὲν δὴ ἔφερε λαβών ·
So he took them and carried them away.


8.3.7
4338
οἱ δὲ ἡγεμόνες ἐπεὶ ἴδοιεν αὐτόν , ἔλεγον ·
And when the officers one after another saw him, they would say:


8.3.7
4339
μέγας δὴ σύγε , ὦ Φεραύλα , ὁπότε γε καὶ ἡμῖν τάξεις ἃ ἂν δέῃ ποιεῖν .
You must be a great man, Pheraulas, seeing that you are to command even us what we must do.


8.3.7
4340
οὐ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Φεραύλας , οὐ μόνον γε , ὡς ἔοικεν , ἀλλὰ καὶ συσκευοφορήσω ·
No, by Zeus, Pheraulas would answer; not only not that, so it seems, but I am even to be one of the porters;


8.3.7
4341
νῦν γοῦν φέρω τώδε δύο κασᾶ , τὸν μὲν σοί , τὸν δὲ ἄλλῳ ·
at any rate, I am now carrying these two mantles here, the one for you, the other for some one else.


8.3.7
4342
σὺ μέντοι τούτων λαβὲ ὁπότερον βούλει .
You, however, shall have your choice.


8.3.8
4343
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ὁ μὲν λαμβάνων τὸν κασᾶν τοῦ μὲν φθόνου ἐπελέληστο , εὐθὺς δὲ συνεβουλεύετο αὐτῷ ὁπότερον λαμβάνοι ·
With that, of course, the man who was receiving the mantle would at once forget about his jealousy and presently be asking his advice which one to choose.


8.3.8
4344
ὁ δὲ συμβουλεύσας ἂν ὁπότερος βελτίων εἴη καὶ εἰπών ·
And he would give his advice as to which one was better and say:


8.3.8
4345
ἤν μου κατηγορήσῃς ὅτι αἵρεσίν σοι ἔδωκα , εἰς αὖθις ὅταν διακονῶ , ἑτέρῳ χρήσῃ μοι διακόνῳ ·
If you betray that I have given you your choice, you will find me a different sort of servant the next time I come to serve.


8.3.8
4346
ὁ μὲν δὴ Φεραύλας οὕτω διαδοὺς ᾗ ἐτάχθη εὐθὺς ἐπεμελεῖτο τῶν εἰς τὴν ἐξέλασιν ὅπως ὡς κάλλιστα ἕκαστα ἕξοι .
And when Pheraulas had distributed everything as he had been instructed to do, he at once began to arrange for the procession that it might be as splendid as possible in every detail.


8.3.9
4347
ἡνίκα δ’ ἡ ὑστεραία ἧκε , καθαρὰ μὲν ἦν πάντα πρὸ ἡμέρας , στοῖχοι δὲ εἱστήκεσαν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν τῆς ὁδοῦ , ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν ἔτι ἵστανται ᾗ ἂν βασιλεὺς μέλλῃ ἐλαύνειν ·
When the next day dawned, everything was in order before sunrise;  rows of soldiers stood on this side of the street and on that, just as even to this day the Persians stand, where the king is to pass;


8.3.9
4348
ὧν ἐντὸς οὐδενὶ ἔστιν εἰσιέναι τῶν μὴ τετιμημένων ·
and within these lines no one may enter except those who hold positions of honour.


8.3.9
4349
μαστιγοφόροι δὲ καθέστασαν , οἳ ἔπαιον εἴ τις ἐνοχλοίη .
And policemen with whips in their hands were stationed there, who struck any one who tried to crowd in.


8.3.9
4350
ἕστασαν δὲ πρῶτον μὲν τῶν δορυφόρων εἰς τετρακισχιλίους ἔμπροσθεν τῶν πυλῶν εἰς τέτταρας , δισχίλιοι δ’ ἑκατέρωθεν τῶν πυλῶν .
First in order, in front of the gates stood about four thousand lancers, four deep, and two thousand on either side the gates.


8.3.10
4351
καὶ οἱ ἱππεῖς δὲ πάντες παρῆσαν καταβεβηκότες ἀπὸ τῶν ἵππων , καὶ διειρκότες τὰς χεῖρας διὰ τῶν κανδύων , ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν ἔτι διείρουσιν , ὅταν ὁρᾷ βασιλεύς .
And all the cavalry-men had alighted and stood there beside their horses, and they all had their hands thrust through the sleeves of their doublets, just as they do even to this day when the king sees them.


8.3.10
4352
ἕστασαν δὲ Πέρσαι μὲν ἐκ δεξιᾶς , οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι σύμμαχοι ἐξ ἀριστερᾶς τῆς ὁδοῦ , καὶ τὰ ἅρματα ὡσαύτως τὰ ἡμίσεα ἑκατέρωθεν .
The Persians stood on the right side of the street, the others, the allies, on the left, and the chariots were arranged in the same way, half on either side.


8.3.11
4353
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἀνεπετάννυντο αἱ τοῦ βασιλείου πύλαι , πρῶτον μὲν ἤγοντο τῷ Διὶ ταῦροι πάγκαλοι εἰς τέτταρας καὶ οἷς τῶν ἄλλων θεῶν οἱ μάγοι ἐξηγοῦντο ·
Then, when the palace gates were thrown open, there were led out at the head of the procession four abreast some exceptionally handsome bulls for Zeus and for the other gods as the magi directed;


8.3.11
4354
πολὺ γὰρ οἴονται Πέρσαι χρῆναι τοῖς περὶ τοὺς θεοὺς μᾶλλον τεχνίταις χρῆσθαι ἢ περὶ τ- ἄλλα .
for the Persians think that they ought much more scrupulously to be guided by those whose profession is with things divine than they are by those in other professions.


8.3.12
4355
μετὰ δὲ τοὺς βοῦς ἵπποι ἤγοντο θῦμα τῷ Ἡλίῳ ·
Next after the bulls came horses, a sacrifice for the Sun;


8.3.12
4356
μετὰ δὲ τούτους ἐξήγετο ἅρμα λευκὸν χρυσόζυγον ἐστεμμένον Διὸς ἱερόν ·
and after them came a chariot sacred to Zeus; it was drawn by white horses and with a yoke of gold and wreathed with garlands;


8.3.12
4357
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο Ἡλίου ἅρμα λευκόν , καὶ τοῦτο ἐστεμμένον ὥσπερ τὸ πρόσθεν ·
and next, for the Sun, a chariot drawn by white horses and wreathed with garlands like the other.


8.3.12
4358
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἄλλο τρίτον ἅρμα ἐξήγετο , φοινικίσι καταπεπταμένοι οἱ ἵπποι , καὶ πῦρ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἐσχάρας μεγάλης ἄνδρες εἵποντο φέροντες .
After that came a third chariot with horses covered with purple trappings, and behind it followed men carrying fire on a great altar.


8.3.13
4359
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις ἤδη αὐτὸς ἐκ τῶν πυλῶν προυφαίνετο ὁ Κῦρος ἐφ’ ἅρματος ὀρθὴν ἔχων τὴν τιάραν καὶ χιτῶνα πορφυροῦν μεσόλευκον ( ἄλλῳ δ’ οὐκ ἔξεστι μεσόλευκον ἔχειν ) , καὶ περὶ τοῖς σκέλεσιν ἀναξυρίδας ὑσγινοβαφεῖς , καὶ κάνδυν ὁλοπόρφυρον .
Next after these Cyrus himself upon a chariot appeared in the gates wearing his tiara upright, a purple tunic shot with white (no one but the king may wear such a one),


8.3.13
4360
εἶχε δὲ καὶ διάδημα περὶ τῇ τιάρᾳ ·
trousers of scarlet dye about his legs, and a mantle all of purple.


8.3.13
4361
καὶ οἱ συγγενεῖς δὲ αὐτοῦ τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο σημεῖον εἶχον , καὶ νῦν τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἔχουσι .
He had also a fillet about his tiara, and his kinsmen also had the same mark of distinction, and they retain it even now.


8.3.14
4362
τὰς δὲ χεῖρας ἔξω τῶν χειρίδων εἶχε .
His hands he kept outside his sleeves.


8.3.14
4363
παρωχεῖτο δὲ αὐτῷ ἡνίοχος μέγας μέν , μείων δ’ ἐκείνου εἴτε καὶ τῷ ὄντι εἴτε καὶ ὁπωσοῦν ·
With him rode a charioteer, who was tall, but neither in reality nor in appearance so tall as he;


8.3.14
4364
μείζων δ’ ἐφάνη πολὺ Κῦρος .
at all events, Cyrus looked much taller.


8.3.14
4365
ἰδόντες δὲ πάντες προσεκύνησαν , εἴτε καὶ ἄρξαι τινὲς κεκελευσμένοι εἴτε καὶ ἐκπλαγέντες τῇ παρασκευῇ καὶ τῷ δόξαι μέγαν τε καὶ καλὸν φανῆναι τὸν Κῦρον .
And when they saw him, they all prostrated themselves before him, either because some had been instructed to begin this act of homage, or because they were overcome by the splendour of his presence, or because Cyrus appeared so great and so goodly to look upon;


8.3.14
4366
πρόσθεν δὲ Περσῶν οὐδεὶς Κῦρον προσεκύνει .
at any rate, no one of the Persians had ever prostrated himself before Cyrus before.


8.3.15
4367
ἐπεὶ δὲ προῄει τὸ τοῦ Κύρου ἅρμα , προηγοῦντο μὲν οἱ τετρακισχίλιοι δορυφόροι , παρείποντο δὲ οἱ δισχίλιοι ἑκατέρωθεν τοῦ ἅρματος ·
Then, when Cyrus’s chariot had come forth, the four thousand lancers took the lead, and the two thousand fell in line on either side of his chariot;


8.3.15
4368
ἐφείποντο δὲ οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν σκηπτοῦχοι ἐφ’ ἵππων κεκοσμημένοι σὺν τοῖς παλτοῖς ἀμφὶ τοὺς τριακοσίους .
and his mace-bearers, about three hundred in number, followed next in gala attire, mounted, and equipped with their customary javelins.


8.3.16
4369
οἱ δ’ αὖ τῷ Κύρῳ τρεφόμενοι ἵπποι παρήγοντο χρυσοχάλινοι , ῥαβδωτοῖς ἱματίοις καταπεπταμένοι , ἀμφὶ τοὺς διακοσίους ·
Next came Cyrus’s private stud of horses, about two hundred in all, led along with gold-mounted bridles and covered over with embroidered housings.


8.3.16
4370
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις δισχίλιοι ξυστοφόροι ·
Behind these came two thousand spearmen,


8.3.16
4371
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις ἱππεῖς οἱ πρῶτοι γενόμενοι μύριοι , εἰς ἑκατὸν πανταχῇ τεταγμένοι ·
and after them the original ten thousand Persian cavalry, drawn up in a square with a hundred on each side;


8.3.16
4372
ἡγεῖτο δ’ αὐτῶν Χρυσάντας ·
and Chrysantas was in command of them.


8.3.17
4373
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις μύριοι ἄλλοι Περσῶν ἱππεῖς τεταγμένοι ὡσαύτως , ἡγεῖτο δ’ αὐτῶν Ὑστάσπας ·
Behind them came ten thousand other Persian horsemen arranged in the same way with Hystaspas in command,


8.3.17
4374
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις ἄλλοι μύριοι ὡσαύτως , ἡγεῖτο δ’ αὐτῶν Δατάμας ·
and after them ten thousand more in the same formation with Datamas as their commander; following them, as many more with Gadatas in command.


8.3.18
4375
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις ἄλλοι , ἡγεῖτο δ’ αὐτῶν Γαδάτας ·
And then followed in succession the cavalry of the Medes, Armenians, Hyrcanians, Cadusians, and Sacians;


8.3.18
4376
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Μῆδοι ἱππεῖς , ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Ἀρμένιοι , μετὰ δὲ τούτους Ὑρκάνιοι , μετὰ δὲ τούτους Καδούσιοι , ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις Σάκαι ·
and behind the cavalry came the chariots ranged four abreast, and Artabatas, a Persian, had command of them.


8.3.18
4377
μετὰ δὲ τοὺς ἱππέας ἅρματα ἐπὶ τεττάρων τεταγμένα , ἡγεῖτο δ’ αὐτῶν Ἀρταβάτας Πέρσης .
And as he proceeded, a great throng of people followed outside the lines with petitions to present to Cyrus, one about one matter, another about another.


8.3.19
4378
πορευομένου δὲ αὐτοῦ πάμπολλοι ἄνθρωποι παρείποντο ἔξω τῶν σημείων , δεόμενοι Κύρου ἄλλος ἄλλης πράξεως .
So he sent to them some of his mace-bearers, who followed, three on either side of his chariot, for the express purpose of carrying messages for him;


8.3.19
4379
πέμψας οὖν πρὸς αὐτοὺς τῶν σκηπτούχων τινάς , οἳ παρείποντο αὐτῷ τρεῖς ἑκατέρωθεν τοῦ ἅρματος αὐτοῦ τούτου ἕνεκα τοῦ διαγγέλλειν , ἐκέλευσεν εἰπεῖν αὐτοῖς , εἴ τίς τι αὐτοῦ δέοιτο , διδάσκειν τῶν ἱππάρχων τινὰ ὅ τι τις βούλοιτο , ἐκείνους δ’ ἔφη πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐρεῖν .
and he bade them say that if any one wanted anything of him, he should make his wish known to some one of his cavalry officers and they, he said, would inform him.


8.3.19
4380
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἀπιόντες εὐθὺς κατὰ τοὺς ἱππέας ἐπορεύοντο καὶ ἐβουλεύοντο τίνι ἕκαστος προσίοι .
So the people at once fell back and made their way along the lines of cavalry, each considering what officer he should approach.


8.3.20
4381
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος οὓς ἐβούλετο μάλιστα θεραπεύεσθαι τῶν φίλων ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων , τούτους πέμπων τινὰ πρὸς αὑτὸν ἐκάλει καθ’ ἕνα ἕκαστον καὶ ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς οὕτως ·
From time to time Cyrus would send some one to call to him one by one those of his friends whom he wished to have most courted by the people, and would say to them:


8.3.20
4382
ἤν τις ὑμᾶς διδάσκῃ τι τούτων τῶν παρεπομένων , ὃς μὲν ἂν μηδὲν δοκῇ ὑμῖν λέγειν , μὴ προσέχετε αὐτῷ τὸν νοῦν ·
If any one of the people following the procession tries to bring anything to your attention, if you do not think he has anything worth while to say, pay no attention to him;


8.3.20
4383
ὃς δ’ ἂν δικαίων δεῖσθαι δοκῇ , εἰσαγγέλλετε πρὸς ἐμέ , ἵνα κοινῇ βουλευόμενοι διαπράττωμεν αὐτοῖς .
but if any one seems to you to ask what is fair, come and tell me, so that we may consult together and grant the petition.


8.3.21
4384
οἱ μὲν δὴ ἄλλοι , ἐπεὶ καλέσειεν , ἀνὰ κράτος ἐλαύνοντες ὑπήκουον , συναύξοντες τὴν ἀρχὴν τῷ Κύρῳ καὶ ἐνδεικνύμενοι ὅτι σφόδρα πείθοιντο ·
And whenever he sent such summons, the men would ride up at full speed to answer it, thereby magnifying the majesty of Cyrus’s authority and at the same time showing their eagerness to obey.


8.3.21
4385
Δαϊφέρηνς δέ τις ἦν σολοικότερος ἄνθρωπος τῷ τρόπῳ , ὃς ᾤετο , εἰ μὴ ταχὺ ὑπακούοι , ἐλευθερώτερος ἂν φαίνεσθαι .
There was but one exception: a certain Daïphernes, a fellow rather boorish in his manners, thought that he would show more independence if he did not obey at once.


8.3.22
4386
αἰσθόμενος οὖν ὁ Κῦρος τοῦτο , πρὶν προσελθεῖν αὐτὸν καὶ διαλεχθῆναι αὐτῷ ὑποπέμψας τινὰ τῶν σκηπτούχων εἰπεῖν ἐκέλευσε πρὸς αὐτὸν ὅτι οὐδὲν ἔτι δέοιτο ·
Cyrus noticed this; and so, before Daïphernes came and talked with him, he sent one of his mace-bearers privately to say that he had no more need of him;


8.3.22
4387
καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν οὐκ ἐκάλει .
and he did not send for him again.


8.3.23
4388
ὡς δ’ ὁ ὕστερον κληθεὶς αὐτοῦ πρότερος αὐτῷ προσήλασεν , ὁ Κῦρος καὶ ἵππον αὐτῷ ἔδωκε τῶν παρεπομένων καὶ ἐκέλευσε τῶν σκηπτούχων τινὰ συναπαγαγεῖν αὐτῷ ὅποι κελεύσειε .
But when a man who was summoned later than Daïphernes rode up to him sooner than he, Cyrus gave him one of the horses that were being led in the procession and gave orders to one of the mace-bearers to have it led away for him wherever he should direct.


8.3.23
4389
τοῖς δὲ ἰδοῦσιν ἔντιμόν τι τοῦτο ἔδοξεν εἶναι , καὶ πολὺ πλείονες ἐκ τούτου αὐτὸν ἐθεράπευον ἀνθρώπων .
And to those who saw it it seemed to be a mark of great honour, and as a consequence of that event many more people paid court to that man.


8.3.24
4390
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀφίκοντο πρὸς τὰ τεμένη , ἔθυσαν τῷ Διὶ καὶ ὡλοκαύτησαν τοὺς ταύρους ·
So, when they came to the sanctuaries, they performed the sacrifice to Zeus and made a holocaust of the bulls;


8.3.24
4391
ἔπειτα τῷ Ἡλίῳ καὶ ὡλοκαύτησαν τοὺς ἵππους ·
then they gave the horses to the flames in honour of the Sun;


8.3.24
4392
ἔπειτα Γῇ σφάξαντες ὡς ἐξηγήσαντο οἱ μάγοι ἐποίησαν ·
next they did sacrifice to the Earth, as the magi directed,


8.3.24
4393
ἔπειτα δὲ ἥρωσι τοῖς Συρίαν ἔχουσι .
and lastly to the tutelary heroes of Syria.


8.3.25
4394
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα καλοῦ ὄντος τοῦ χωρίου ἔδειξε τέρμα ὡς ἐπὶ πέντε σταδίων χωρίου , καὶ εἶπε κατὰ φῦλα ἀνὰ κράτος ἐνταῦθα ἀφεῖναι τοὺς ἵππους .
And after that, as the locality seemed adapted to the purpose, he pointed out a goal about five stadia distant and commanded the riders, nation by nation, to put their horses at full speed toward it.


8.3.25
4395
σὺν μὲν οὖν τοῖς Πέρσαις αὐτὸς ἤλασε καὶ ἐνίκα πολύ ·
Accordingly, he himself rode with the Persians and came in far ahead of the rest,


8.3.25
4396
μάλιστα γὰρ ἐμεμελήκει αὐτῷ ἱππικῆς ·
for he had given especial attention to horsemanship.


8.3.25
4397
Μήδων δὲ Ἀρτάβαζος ἐνίκα ·
Among the Medes, Artabazus won the race,


8.3.25
4398
Κῦρος γὰρ αὐτῷ τὸν ἵππον ἐδεδώκει ·
for the horse he had was a gift from Cyrus;


8.3.25
4399
Σύρων δὲ τῶν ἀποστάντων Γαδάτας ·
among the Assyrians who had revolted to him, Gadatas secured the first place;


8.3.25
4400
Ἀρμενίων δὲ Τιγράνης ·
among the Armenians, Tigranes;


8.3.25
4401
Ὑρκανίων δὲ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἱππάρχου ·
and among the Hyrcanians, the son of the master of the horse;


8.3.25
4402
Σακῶν δὲ ἰδιώτης ἀνὴρ ἀπέλιπεν ἄρα τῷ ἵππῳ τοὺς ἄλλους ἵππους ἐγγὺς τῷ ἡμίσει τοῦ δρόμου .
but among the Sacians a certain private soldier with his horse actually outdistanced the rest by nearly half the course.


8.3.26
4403
ἔνθα δὴ λέγεται ὁ Κῦρος ἐρέσθαι τὸν νεανίσκον εἰ δέξαιτ’ ἂν βασιλείαν ἀντὶ τοῦ ἵππου .
Thereupon Cyrus is said to have asked the young man if he would take a kingdom for his horse.


8.3.26
4404
τὸν δ’ ἀποκρίνασθαι ὅτι βασιλείαν μὲν οὐκ ἂν δεξαίμην , χάριν δὲ ἀνδρὶ ἀγαθῷ καταθέσθαι δεξαίμην ἄν .
No, answered he; I would not take a kingdom for him, but I would take the chance of laying up a store of gratitude with a brave man.


8.3.27
4405
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε ·
Aye said Cyrus,


8.3.27
4406
καὶ μὴν ἐγὼ δεῖξαί σοι θέλω ἔνθα κἂν μύων βάλῃς , οὐκ ἂν ἁμάρτοις ἀνδρὸς ἀγαθοῦ .
and I will show you where you could not fail to hit a brave man, even if you throw with your eyes shut.


8.3.27
4407
πάντως τοίνυν , ὁ Σάκας ἔφη , δεῖξόν μοι ·
All right, then, said the Sacian; show me;


8.3.27
4408
ὡς βαλῶ γε ταύτῃ τῇ βώλῳ , ἔφη ἀνελόμενος .
and I will throw this clod here. And with that he picked one up.


8.3.28
4409
καὶ ὁ μὲν Κῦρος δείκνυσιν αὐτῷ ὅπου ἦσαν πλεῖστοι τῶν φίλων ·
And Cyrus pointed out to him the place where most of his friends were.


8.3.28
4410
ὁ δὲ καταμύων ἵησι τῇ βώλῳ καὶ παρελαύνοντος Φεραύλα τυγχάνει ·
And the other, shutting his eyes, let fly with the clod and hit Pheraulas as he was riding by;


8.3.28
4411
ἔτυχε γὰρ ὁ Φεραύλας παραγγέλλων τι τακτὸς παρὰ τοῦ Κύρου ·
for Pheraulas happened to be carrying some message under orders from Cyrus.


8.3.28
4412
βληθεὶς δὲ οὐδὲ μετεστράφη , ἀλλ’ ᾤχετο ἐφ’ ὅπερ ἐτάχθη .
But though he was hit, he did not so much as turn around but went on to attend to his commission.


8.3.29
4413
ἀναβλέψας δὲ ὁ Σάκας ἐρωτᾷ τίνος ἔτυχεν .
The Sacian opened his eyes and asked whom he had hit.


8.3.29
4414
οὐ μὰ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐδενὸς τῶν παρόντων .
None of those here, by Zeus, said Cyrus.


8.3.29
4415
ἀλλ’ οὐ μέντοι , ἔφη ὁ νεανίσκος , τῶν γε ἀπόντων .
Well, surely it was not one of those who are not here, said the youth.


8.3.29
4416
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , σύγε ἐκείνου τοῦ παρὰ τὰ ἅρματα ταχὺ ἐλαύνοντος τὸν ἵππον .
Yes, by Zeus, said Cyrus, it was; you hit that man who is riding so fast along the line of chariots yonder.


8.3.29
4417
καὶ πῶς , ἔφη , οὐδὲ μεταστρέφεται ;
And why does he not even turn around? said the youth.


8.3.30
4418
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος ἔφη ·
answered Cyrus.


8.3.30
4419
μαινόμενος γάρ τίς ἐστιν , ὡς ἔοικεν .
Because he is crazy, I should think,


8.3.30
4420
ἀκούσας ὁ νεανίσκος ᾤχετο σκεψόμενος τίς εἴη ·
On hearing this, the young man went to find out who it was.


8.3.30
4421
καὶ εὑρίσκει τὸν Φεραύλαν γῆς τε κατάπλεων τὸ γένειον καὶ αἵματος ·
And he found Pheraulas with his chin covered with dirt and blood,


8.3.30
4422
ἐρρύη γὰρ αὐτῷ ἐκ τῆς ῥινὸς βληθέντι .
for the blood had flowed from his nose where he had been struck;


8.3.31
4423
ἐπεὶ δὲ προσῆλθεν , ἤρετο αὐτὸν εἰ βληθείη .
and when he came up to him he asked him if he had been hit.


8.3.31
4424
ὁ δὲ ἀπεκρίνατο ·
he answered:


8.3.31
4425
ὡς ὁρᾷς .
As you see,


8.3.31
4426
δίδωμι τοίνυν σοι , ἔφη , τοῦτον τὸν ἵππον .
Well then, said the other, I will make you a present of this horse.


8.3.31
4427
ὁ δ’ ἐπήρετο ·
asked Pheraulas.


8.3.31
4428
ἀντὶ τοῦ ;
What for?


8.3.31
4429
ἐκ τούτου δὴ διηγεῖτο ὁ Σάκας τὸ πρᾶγμα , καὶ τέλος εἶπε ·
Then the Sacian related the circumstances and finally said:


8.3.31
4430
καὶ οἶμαί γε οὐχ ἡμαρτηκέναι ἀνδρὸς ἀγαθοῦ .
And in my opinion, at least, I have not failed to hit a brave man.


8.3.32
4431
καὶ ὁ Φεραύλας εἶπεν ·
But you would give him to a richer man than I, if you were wise, answered Pheraulas.


8.3.32
4432
ἀλλὰ πλουσιωτέρῳ μὲν ἄν , εἰ ἐσωφρόνεις , ἢ ἐμοὶ ἐδίδους ·
Still, even as it is, I will accept him.


8.3.32
4433
νῦν δὲ κ- ἐγὼ δέξομαι .
And I pray the gods, who have caused me to receive your blow, to grant me to see that you never regret your gift to me.


8.3.32
4434
ἐπεύχομαι δέ , ἔφη , τοῖς θεοῖς , οἵπερ με ἐποίησαν βληθῆναι ὑπὸ σοῦ , δοῦναί μοι ποιῆσαι μὴ μεταμέλειν σοι τῆς ἐμῆς δωρεᾶς .
And now, said he, mount my horse and ride away;


8.3.32
4435
καὶ νῦν μέν , ἔφη , ἀπέλα , ἀναβὰς ἐπὶ τὸν ἐμὸν ἵππον ·
I will join you presently.


8.3.32
4436
αὖθις δ’ ἐγὼ παρέσομαι πρὸς σέ .
Thus they made the exchange.


8.3.32
4437
οἱ μὲν δὴ οὕτω διηλλάξαντο .
Of the Cadusians, Rhathines was the winner.


8.3.33
4438
Καδουσίων δὲ ἐνίκα Ῥαθίνης .
Of the Cadusians, Rhathines was the winner.


8.3.33
4439
ἀφίει δὲ καὶ τὰ ἅρματα καθ’ ἕκαστον ·
The chariots also he allowed to race by divisions;


8.3.33
4440
τοῖς δὲ νικῶσι πᾶσιν ἐδίδου βοῦς τε , ὅπως ἂν θύσαντες ἑστιῷντο , καὶ ἐκπώματα .
to all the winners he gave cups and cattle, so that they might sacrifice and have a banquet.


8.3.33
4441
τὸν μὲν οὖν βοῦν ἔλαβε καὶ αὐτὸς τὸ νικητήριον ·
He himself, then, took the ox as his prize,


8.3.33
4442
τῶν δ’ ἐκπωμάτων τὸ αὑτοῦ μέρος Φεραύλᾳ ἔδωκεν , ὅτι καλῶς ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ τὴν ἐκ τοῦ βασιλείου ἔλασιν διατάξαι .
but his share of the cups he gave to Pheraulas because he thought that that officer, as grand marshal, had managed the procession from the palace admirably.


8.3.34
4443
οὕτω δὴ τότε ὑπὸ Κύρου κατασταθεῖσα ἡ βασιλέως ἔλασις οὕτως ἔτι καὶ νῦν διαμένει , πλὴν τὰ ἱερὰ ἄπεστιν , ὅταν μὴ θύῃ .
The procession of the king, therefore, as thus instituted by Cyrus, continues even so unto this day,


8.3.34
4444
ὡς δὲ ταῦτα τέλος εἶχεν , ἀφικνοῦνται πάλιν εἰς τὴν πόλιν , καὶ ἐσκήνησαν , οἷς μὲν ἐδόθησαν οἰκίαι , κατ’ οἰκίας , οἷς δὲ μή , ἐν τάξει .
except that the victims are omitted when the king does not offer sacrifice. When it was all over, they went back to the city to their lodgings — those to whom houses had been given, to their homes; those who had none, to their company’s quarters.


8.3.35
4445
καλέσας δὲ καὶ ὁ Φεραύλας τὸν Σάκαν τὸν δόντα τὸν ἵππον ἐξένιζε , καὶ τ- ἄλλα τε παρεῖχεν ἔκπλεω , καὶ ἐπεὶ ἐδεδειπνήκεσαν , τὰ ἐκπώματα αὐτῷ ἃ ἔλαβε παρὰ Κύρου ἐμπιμπλὰς προύπινε καὶ ἐδωρεῖτο .
Pheraulas invited to his house the Sacian also, who had given him his horse, and entertained his new friend there and made bountiful provision for him in every way; and when they had dined, he filled up the cups that he had received from Cyrus , drank to his health, and then gave him the cups.


8.3.36
4446
καὶ ὁ Σάκας ὁρῶν πολλὴν μὲν καὶ καλὴν στρωμνήν , πολλὴν δὲ καὶ καλὴν κατασκευήν , καὶ οἰκέτας δὲ πολλούς , εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Φεραύλα , ἦ καὶ οἴκοι τῶν πλουσίων ἦσθα ;
And when the Sacian saw the many beautiful coverlets, the many beautiful pieces of furniture, and the large number of servants, he said:  Pray tell me, Pheraulas, were you a rich man at home, too?


8.3.37
4447
καὶ ὁ Φεραύλας εἶπε ·
 Pheraulas answered:


8.3.37
4448
ποίων πλουσίων ;
Rich, indeed!


8.3.37
4449
τῶν μὲν οὖν σαφῶς ἀποχειροβιώτων .
nay rather, as everybody knows, one of those who lived by the labour of their hands.


8.3.37
4450
ἐμὲ γάρ τοι ὁ πατὴρ τὴν μὲν τῶν παίδων παιδείαν γλίσχρως αὐτὸς ἐργαζόμενος καὶ τρέφων ἐπαίδευεν ·
To be sure, my father, who supported us by hard labour and close economy on his own part, managed to give me the education of the boys;


8.3.37
4451
ἐπεὶ δὲ μειράκιον ἐγενόμην , οὐ δυνάμενος τρέφειν ἀργόν , εἰς ἀγρὸν ἀπαγαγὼν ἐκέλευσεν ἐργάζεσθαι .
but when I became a young man, he could not support me in idleness, and so he took me off to the farm and put me to work.


8.3.38
4452
ἔνθα δὴ ἐγὼ ἀντέτρεφον ἐκεῖνον , ἕως ἔζη , αὐτὸς σκάπτων καὶ σπείρων καὶ μάλα μικρὸν γῄδιον , οὐ μέντοι πονηρόν γε , ἀλλὰ πάντων δικαιότατον ·
And there, as long as he lived, I, in turn, supported him by digging and planting a very little plot of ground.


8.3.38
4453
ὅ τι γὰρ λάβοι σπέρμα , καλῶς καὶ δικαίως ἀπεδίδου αὐτό τε καὶ τόκον οὐδέν τι πολύν ·
It was really not such a very bad plot of ground, but, on the contrary, the most honest;


8.3.38
4454
ἤδη δέ ποτε ὑπὸ γενναιότητος καὶ διπλάσια ἀπέδωκεν ὧν ἔλαβεν .
for all the seed that it received it returned fairly and honestly, and yet with no very great amount of interest.


8.3.38
4455
οἴκοι μὲν οὖν ἔγωγε οὕτως ἔζων ·
And sometimes, in a fit of generosity, it would even return to me twice as much as it received.


8.3.38
4456
νῦν δὲ ταῦτα πάντα ἃ ὁρᾷς Κῦρός μοι ἔδωκε .
Thus, then, I used to live at home; but now everything that you see has been given to me by Cyrus.


8.3.39
4457
καὶ ὁ Σάκας εἶπεν ·
What a happy fellow you must be, said the Sacian,


8.3.39
4458
ὦ μακάριε σὺ τά τε ἄλλα καὶ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ὅτι ἐκ πένητος πλούσιος γεγένησαι ·
for every reason, but particularly because from being poor you have become rich.


8.3.39
4459
πολὺ γὰρ οἴομαί σε καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἥδιον πλουτεῖν ὅτι πεινήσας χρημάτων ἐπλούτησας .
For you must enjoy your riches much more, I think, for the very reason that it was only after being hungry for wealth that you became rich.


8.3.40
4460
καὶ ὁ Φεραύλας εἶπεν ·
Why, do you actually suppose, my Sacian friend, answered Pheraulas,


8.3.40
4461
ἦ γὰρ οὕτως , ὦ Σάκα , ὑπολαμβάνεις ὡς ἐγὼ νῦν τοσούτῳ ἥδιον ζῶ ὅσῳ πλείω κέκτημαι ;
that the more I own, the more happily I live?


8.3.40
4462
οὐκ οἶσθα , ἔφη , ὅτι ἐσθίω μὲν καὶ πίνω καὶ καθεύδω οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν νῦν ἥδιον ἢ τότε ὅτε πένης ἦν ·
You are not aware, he went on, that it gives me not one whit more pleasure to eat and drink and sleep now than it did when I was poor.


8.3.40
4463
ὅτι δὲ ταῦτα πολλά ἐστι , τοσοῦτον κερδαίνω , πλείω μὲν φυλάττειν δεῖ , πλείω δὲ ἄλλοις διανέμειν , πλειόνων δὲ ἐπιμελούμενον πράγματα ἔχειν .
My only gain from having so much is that I am obliged to take care of more, distribute more to others, and have the trouble of looking after more than I used to have.


8.3.41
4464
νῦν γὰρ δὴ ἐμὲ πολλοὶ μὲν οἰκέται σῖτον αἰτοῦσι , πολλοὶ δὲ πιεῖν , πολλοὶ δὲ ἱμάτια ·
For now many domestics look to me for food, many for drink, and many for clothes,


8.3.41
4465
οἱ δὲ ἰατρῶν δέονται ·
while some need doctors;


8.3.41
4466
ἥκει δέ τις ἢ τῶν προβάτων λελυκωμένα φέρων ἢ τῶν βοῶν κατακεκρημνισμένα ἢ νόσον φάσκων ἐμπεπτωκέναι τοῖς κτήνεσιν ·
and one comes to me with a tale about sheep attacked by wolves, or of oxen killed by falling over a precipice, or to say that some disease has broken out among the cattle.


8.3.41
4467
ὥστε μοι δοκῶ , ἔφη ὁ Φεραύλας , νῦν διὰ τὸ πολλὰ ἔχειν πλείω λυπεῖσθαι ἢ πρόσθεν διὰ τὸ ὀλίγα ἔχειν .
And so it looks to me, said Pheraulas, as if I had more trouble now through possessing much than I used to have from possessing little.


8.3.42
4468
καὶ ὁ Σάκας , ἀλλὰ ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὅταν σῶα ᾖ , πολλὰ ὁρῶν πολλαπλάσια ἐμοῦ εὐφραίνῃ .
But still, by Zeus, said the Sacian, when everything is going well, you must at the sight of so many blessings be many times as happy as I.


8.3.42
4469
καὶ ὁ Φεραύλας εἶπεν ·
The pleasure that the possession of wealth gives, my good Sacian, said Pheraulas,


8.3.42
4470
οὔτοι , ὦ Σάκα , οὕτως ἡδύ ἐστι τὸ ἔχειν χρήματα ὡς ἀνιαρὸν τὸ ἀποβάλλειν .
is not nearly so great as the pain that is caused by its loss.


8.3.42
4471
γνώσῃ δ’ ὅτι ἐγὼ ἀληθῆ λέγω ·
And you shall be convinced that what I say is true:


8.3.42
4472
τῶν μὲν γὰρ πλουτούντων οὐδεὶς ἀναγκάζεται ὑφ’ ἡδονῆς ἀγρυπνεῖν , τῶν δὲ ἀποβαλλόντων τι ὄψει οὐδένα δυνάμενον καθεύδειν ὑπὸ λύπης .
for not one of those who are rich is made sleepless for joy, but of those who lose anything you will not see one who is able to sleep for grief.


8.3.43
4473
μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Σάκας , οὐδέ γε τῶν λαμβανόντων τι νυστάζοντα οὐδένα ἂν ἴδοις ὑφ’ ἡδονῆς .
Not so, by Zeus,  said the Sacian;  but of those who get anything not one could you see who gets a wink of sleep for very joy.


8.3.44
4474
ἀληθῆ , ἔφη , λέγεις ·
True said the other;


8.3.44
4475
εἰ γάρ τοι τὸ ἔχειν οὕτως ὥσπερ τὸ λαμβάνειν ἡδὺ ἦν , πολὺ ἂν διέφερον εὐδαιμονίᾳ οἱ πλούσιοι τῶν πενήτων .
for, you see, if having were as pleasant as getting, the rich would be incomparably happier than the poor.


8.3.44
4476
καὶ ἀνάγκη δέ τοί ἐστιν , ἔφη , ὦ Σάκα , τὸν πολλὰ ἔχοντα πολλὰ καὶ δαπανᾶν καὶ εἰς θεοὺς καὶ εἰς φίλους καὶ εἰς ξένους ·
But, you see, my good Sacian, it is also a matter of course that he who has much should also spend much both in the service of the gods and for his friends and for the strangers within his gates.


8.3.44
4477
ὅστις οὖν ἰσχυρῶς χρήμασιν ἥδεται , εὖ ἴσθι τοῦτον καὶ δαπανῶντα ἰσχυρῶς ἀνιᾶσθαι .
Let me assure you, therefore, that any one who takes inordinate pleasure in the possession of money is also inordinately distressed at having to part with it.


8.3.45
4478
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Σάκας , ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐγὼ τούτων εἰμί , ἀλλὰ καὶ εὐδαιμονίαν τοῦτο νομίζω τὸ πολλὰ ἔχοντα πολλὰ καὶ δαπανᾶν .
Aye, by Zeus,  answered the Sacian;  but I am not one of that sort; my idea of happiness is both to have much and also to spend much.


8.3.46
4479
τί οὖν , ἔφη , πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , ὁ Φεραύλας , οὐχὶ σύγε αὐτίκα μάλα εὐδαίμων ἐγένου καὶ ἐμὲ εὐδαίμονα ἐποίησας ;
In the name of the gods, then, said Pheraulas, please make yourself happy at once and make me happy, too!


8.3.46
4480
λαβὼν γάρ , ἔφη , ταῦτα πάντα κέκτησο , καὶ χρῶ ὅπως βούλει αὐτοῖς ·
Take all this and own it and use it as you wish.


8.3.46
4481
ἐμὲ δὲ μηδὲν ἄλλο ἢ ὥσπερ ξένον τρέφε , καὶ ἔτι εὐτελέστερον ἢ ξένον ·
And as for me, you need do no more than keep me as a guest — aye, even more sparingly than a guest,


8.3.46
4482
ἀρκέσει γάρ μοι ὅ τι ἂν καὶ σὺ ἔχῃς τούτων μετέχειν .
for I shall be content to share whatever you have.


8.3.47
4483
παίζεις , ἔφη ὁ Σάκας .
You are joking, said the Sacian.


8.3.47
4484
καὶ ὁ Φεραύλας ὀμόσας εἶπεν ἦ μὴν σπουδῇ λέγειν .
But Pheraulas assured him with an oath that he was really in earnest in what he proposed.


8.3.47
4485
καὶ ἄλλα γέ σοι , ὦ Σάκα , προσδιαπράξομαι παρὰ Κύρου , μήτε θύρας τὰς Κύρου θεραπεύειν μήτε στρατεύεσθαι ·
And I will get you other favours besides from Cyrus, my Sacian — exemption from attending at court and from serving in the field;


8.3.47
4486
ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν πλουτῶν οἴκοι μένε ·
you may just stay at home with your wealth.


8.3.47
4487
ἐγὼ δὲ ταῦτα ποιήσω καὶ ὑπὲρ σοῦ καὶ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ ·
I will attend to those other duties for you as well as for myself;


8.3.47
4488
καὶ ἐάν τι ἀγαθὸν προσλαμβάνω διὰ τὴν Κύρου θεραπείαν ἢ καὶ ἀπὸ στρατείας τινός , οἴσω πρὸς σέ , ἵνα ἔτι πλειόνων ἄρχῃς ·
and if I secure anything more of value either through my attendance upon Cyrus or from some campaign, I will bring it to you, so that you may have still more wealth at your command.


8.3.47
4489
μόνον , ἔφη , ἐμὲ ἀπόλυσον ταύτης τῆς ἐπιμελείας ·
Only deliver me from this care.


8.3.47
4490
ἢν γὰρ ἐγὼ σχολὴν ἄγω ἀπὸ τούτων , ἐμοί τέ σε οἴομαι πολλὰ καὶ Κύρῳ χρήσιμον ἔσεσθαι .
For if you will relieve me of its burden, I think you will do a great service also to Cyrus as well as to myself.


8.3.48
4491
τούτων οὕτω ῥηθέντων ταῦτα συνέθεντο καὶ ταῦτα ἐποίουν .
When they had thus talked things over together, they came to an agreement according to this last suggestion and proceeded to act upon it.


8.3.48
4492
καὶ ὁ μὲν ἡγεῖτο εὐδαίμων γεγενῆσθαι , ὅτι πολλῶν ἦρχε χρημάτων ·
And the one thought that he had been made a happy man because he had command of great riches,


8.3.48
4493
ὁ δ’ αὖ ἐνόμιζε μακαριώτατος εἶναι , ὅτι ἐπίτροπον ἕξοι σχολὴν παρέχοντα πράττειν ὅ τι ἂν αὐτῷ ἡδὺ ᾖ .
while the other considered himself most blessed because he was to have a steward who would give him leisure to do only whatever was pleasant to him.


8.3.49
4494
ἦν δὲ τοῦ Φεραύλα ὁ τρόπος φιλέταιρός τε καὶ θεραπεύειν οὐδὲν ἡδὺ αὐτῷ οὕτως ἐδόκει εἶναι οὐδ’ ὠφέλιμον ὡς ἀνθρώπους .
Now, Pheraulas was naturally a good fellow, and nothing seemed to him so pleasant or so useful as to serve other people.


8.3.49
4495
καὶ γὰρ βέλτιστον πάντων τῶν ζῴων ἡγεῖτο ἄνθρωπον εἶναι καὶ εὐχαριστότατον , ὅτι ἑώρα τούς τε ἐπαινουμένους ὑπό τινος ἀντεπαινοῦντας τούτους προθύμως τοῖς τε χαριζομένοις πειρωμένους ἀντιχαρίζεσθαι , καὶ οὓς γνοῖεν εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχοντας , τούτοις ἀντ’ εὖ νοοῦντας , καὶ οὓς εἰδεῖεν φιλοῦντας αὐτούς , τούτους μισεῖν οὐ δυναμένους , καὶ γονέας δὲ πολὺ μᾶλλον ἀντιθεραπεύειν πάντων τῶν ζῴων ἐθέλοντας καὶ ζῶντας καὶ τελευτήσαντας ·
For he held man to be the best and most grateful of all creatures, since he saw that when people are praised by anyone they are very glad to praise him in turn; and when anyone does them a favour, they try to do him one in return; when they recognize that anyone is kindly disposed toward them they return his good-will; and when they know that anyone loves them they cannot dislike him; and he noticed especially that they strive more earnestly than any other creature to return the loving care of parents both during their parents’ lifetime and after their death;


8.3.49
4496
τὰ δ’ ἄλλα πάντα ζῷα καὶ ἀχαριστότερα καὶ ἀγνωμονέστερα ἀνθρώπων ἐγίγνωσκεν εἶναι .
whereas all other creatures, he knew, were both more thankless and more unfeeling than man.


8.3.50
4497
οὕτω δὴ ὅ τε Φεραύλας ὑπερήδετο ὅτι ἐξέσοιτο αὐτῷ ἀπαλλαγέντι τῆς τῶν ἄλλων κτημάτων ἐπιμελείας ἀμφὶ τοὺς φίλους ἔχειν , ὅ τε Σάκας ὅτι ἔμελλε πολλὰ ἔχων πολλοῖς χρήσεσθαι .
And so Pheraulas was greatly delighted to think that he could be rid of the care of all his worldly goods and devote himself to his friends; and the Sacian, on his part, was delighted to think that he was to have much and enjoy much.


8.3.50
4498
ἐφίλει δὲ ὁ μὲν Σάκας τὸν Φεραύλαν , ὅτι προσέφερέ τι ἀεί ·
And the Sacian loved Pheraulas because he was always bringing him something more;


8.3.50
4499
ὁ δὲ τὸν Σάκαν , ὅτι παραλαμβάνειν πάντα ἤθελε καὶ ἀεὶ πλειόνων ἐπιμελούμενος οὐδὲν μᾶλλον αὐτῷ ἀσχολίαν παρεῖχε .
and Pheraulas loved the Sacian because he was willing to take charge of everything; and though the Sacian had continually more in his charge, none the more did he trouble Pheraulas about it.


8.3.50
4500
καὶ οὗτοι μὲν δὴ οὕτω διῆγον .
Thus these two continued to live.


8.4.1
4501
θύσας δὲ καὶ ὁ Κῦρος νικητήρια ἑστιῶν ἐκάλεσε τῶν φίλων οἳ μάλιστ’ αὐτὸν αὔξειν τε βουλόμενοι φανεροὶ ἦσαν καὶ τιμῶντες εὐνοϊκώτατα .
When Cyrus had sacrificed and was celebrating his victory with a banquet, he invited in those of his friends who showed that they were most desirous of magnifying his rule and of honouring him most loyally.


8.4.1
4502
συνεκάλεσε δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ Ἀρτάβαζον τὸν Μῆδον καὶ Τιγράνην τὸν Ἀρμένιον καὶ τὸν Ὑρκάνιον ἵππαρχον καὶ Γωβρύαν .
He invited with them Artabazus the Mede, Tigranes the Armenian, Gobryas, and the commander of the Hyrcanian horse.


8.4.2
4503
Γαδάτας δὲ τῶν σκηπτούχων ἦρχεν αὐτῷ , καὶ ᾗ ἐκεῖνος διεκόσμησεν ἡ πᾶσα ἔνδον δίαιτα καθειστήκει ·
Now Gadatas was the chief of the mace-bearers, and the whole household was managed as he directed.


8.4.2
4504
καὶ ὁπότε μὲν συνδειπνοῖέν τινες , οὐδ’ ἐκάθιζε Γαδάτας , ἀλλ’ ἐπεμελεῖτο ·
Whenever guests dined with Cyrus, Gadatas did not even take his seat, but attended upon them.


8.4.2
4505
ὁπότε δὲ αὐτοὶ εἶεν , καὶ συνεδείπνει ·
But when they were by themselves, he would dine with Cyrus,


8.4.2
4506
ἥδετο γὰρ αὐτῷ συνών ·
for Cyrus enjoyed his company.


8.4.2
4507
ἀντὶ δὲ τούτων πολλοῖς καὶ μεγάλοις ἐτιμᾶτο ὑπὸ τοῦ Κύρου , διὰ δὲ Κῦρον καὶ ὑπ’ ἄλλων .
And in return for his services he received many valuable presents from Cyrus himself and, through Cyrus’s influence, from others also.


8.4.3
4508
ὡς δ’ ἦλθον οἱ κληθέντες ἐπὶ τὸ δεῖπνον , οὐχ ὅπου ἔτυχεν ἕκαστον ἐκάθιζεν , ἀλλ’ ὃν μὲν μάλιστα ἐτίμα , παρὰ τὴν ἀριστερὰν χεῖρα , ὡς εὐεπιβουλευτοτέρας ταύτης οὔσης ἢ τῆς δεξιᾶς , τὸν δὲ δεύτερον παρὰ τὴν δεξιάν , τὸν δὲ τρίτον πάλιν παρὰ τὴν ἀριστεράν , τὸν δὲ τέταρτον παρὰ τὴν δεξιάν ·
So when invited guests came to dinner, he did not assign them their seats at random,


8.4.3
4509
καὶ ἢν πλέονες ὦσιν , ὡσαύτως .
but he seated on Cyrus’s left the one for whom he had the highest regard, for the left side was more readily exposed to treacherous designs than the right; and the one who was second in esteem he seated on his right, the third again on the left, the fourth on the right, and so on, if there were more.


8.4.4
4510
σαφηνίζεσθαι δὲ ὡς ἕκαστον ἐτίμα διὰ τοῦτο ἐδόκει αὐτῷ ἀγαθὸν εἶναι , ὅτι ὅπου μὲν οἴονται ἅνθρωποι τὸν κρατιστεύοντα μήτε κηρυχθήσεσθαι μήτε ἆθλα λήψεσθαι , δῆλοί εἰσιν ἐνταῦθα οὐ φιλονίκως πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔχοντες ·
For he thought it a good plan to show publicly how much regard he had for each one,


8.4.4
4511
ὅπου δὲ μάλιστα πλεονεκτῶν ὁ κράτιστος φαίνεται , ἐνταῦθα προθυμότατα φανεροί εἰσιν ἀγωνιζόμενοι πάντες .
because where people feel that the one who merits most will neither have his praise proclaimed nor receive a prize, there is no emulation among them; but where the most deserving is seen to receive the most preferment, there all are seen to contend most eagerly for the first place.


8.4.5
4512
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος δὲ οὕτως ἐσαφήνιζε μὲν τοὺς κρατιστεύοντας παρ’ ἑαυτῷ , εὐθὺς ἀρξάμενος ἐξ ἕδρας καὶ παραστάσεως .
Accordingly, Cyrus thus made public recognition of those who stood first in his esteem, beginning even with the places they took when sitting or standing in his company.


8.4.5
4513
οὐ μέντοι ἀθάνατον τὴν ταχθεῖσαν ἕδραν κατεστήσατο , ἀλλὰ νόμιμον ἐποιήσατο καὶ ἀγαθοῖς ἔργοις προβῆναι εἰς τὴν τιμιωτέραν ἕδραν , καὶ εἴ τις ῥᾳδιουργοίη , ἀναχωρῆσαι εἰς τὴν ἀτιμοτέραν .
He did not, however, assign the appointed place permanently, but he made it a rule that by noble deeds anyone might advance to a more honoured seat, and that if anyone should conduct himself ill he should go back to one less honoured.


8.4.5
4514
τὸν δὲ πρωτεύοντα ἐν ἕδρᾳ ᾐσχύνετο μὴ οὐ πλεῖστα καὶ ἀγαθὰ ἔχοντα παρ’ αὐτοῦ φαίνεσθαι .
And Cyrus felt it a discredit to himself, if the one who sat in the seat of highest honour was not also seen to receive the greatest number of good things at his hands.


8.4.5
4515
καὶ ταῦτα δὲ ἐπὶ Κύρου γενόμενα οὕτως ἔτι καὶ νῦν διαμένοντα αἰσθανόμεθα .
And we observe, furthermore, that this custom introduced in the time of Cyrus continues in force even to our own times.


8.4.6
4516
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐδείπνουν , ἐδόκει τῷ Γωβρύᾳ τὸ μὲν πολλὰ ἕκαστα εἶναι οὐδέν τι θαυμαστὸν παρ’ ἀνδρὶ πολλῶν ἄρχοντι ·
Now, when they were at dinner, it struck Gobryas as not at all surprising that there was a great abundance of everything upon the table of a man who ruled over wide domains;


8.4.6
4517
τὸ δὲ τὸν Κῦρον οὕτω μεγάλα πράττοντα , εἴ τι ἡδὺ δόξειε λαβεῖν , μηδὲν τούτων μόνον καταδαπανᾶν , ἀλλ’ ἔργον ἔχειν αὐτὸν ἐδόμενον τούτου κοινωνεῖν τοὺς παρόντας , πολλάκις δὲ καὶ τῶν ἀπόντων φίλων ἔστιν οἷς ἑώρα πέμποντα ταῦτα αὐτὸν οἷς ἡσθεὶς τύχοι ·
but what did excite his wonder was that Cyrus, who enjoyed so great good fortune, should never consume by himself any delicacy that he might receive, but took pains to ask his guests to share it, and that he often saw him send even to some of his friends who were not there something that he happened to like very much himself.


8.4.7
4518
ὥστε ἐπεὶ ἐδεδειπνήκεσαν καὶ πάντα τὰ λοιπὰ πολλὰ ὄντα διεπεπόμφει ὁ Κῦρος ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης , εἶπεν ἄρα ὁ Γωβρύας ·
And so when the dinner was over and Cyrus had sent around to others all that was left from the meal — and there was a great deal left —


8.4.7
4519
ἀλλ’ , ἐγώ , ὦ Κῦρε , πρόσθεν μὲν ἡγούμην τούτῳ σε πλεῖστον διαφέρειν ἀνθρώπων τῷ στρατηγικώτατον εἶναι ·
Gobryas could not help remarking: Well, Cyrus, I used to think that you surpassed all other men in that you were the greatest general;


8.4.7
4520
νῦν δὲ θεοὺς ὄμνυμι ἦ μὴν ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν πλέον σε διαφέρειν φιλανθρωπίᾳ ἢ στρατηγίᾳ .
and now, I swear by the gods, you seem actually to excel even more in kindness than in generalship.


8.4.8
4521
νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος ·
Aye, by Zeus, answered Cyrus;


8.4.8
4522
καὶ μὲν δὴ καὶ ἐπιδείκνυμαι τὰ ἔργα πολὺ ἥδιον φιλανθρωπίας ἢ στρατηγίας .
and what is more, I assure you that I take much more pleasure in showing forth my deeds of kindness than ever I did in my deeds of generalship.


8.4.8
4523
πῶς δή ;
How so?


8.4.8
4524
ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας .
asked Gobryas.


8.4.8
4525
ὅτι , ἔφη , τὰ μὲν κακῶς ποιοῦντα ἀνθρώπους δεῖ ἐπιδείκνυσθαι , τὰ δὲ εὖ .
Because said he, in the one field, one must necessarily do harm to men; in the other, only good.


8.4.9
4526
ἐκ τούτου δὴ ἐπεὶ ὑπέπινον , ἤρετο ὁ Ὑστάσπας τὸν Κῦρον ·
Later, when they were drinking after their meal, Hystaspas asked:


8.4.9
4527
ἆρ’ ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ἀχθεσθείης μοι , εἴ σε ἐροίμην ὃ βούλομαί σου πυθέσθαι ;
Pray, Cyrus, would you be displeased with me, if I were to ask you something that I wish to know from you?


8.4.9
4528
ἀλλὰ ναὶ μὰ τοὺς θεούς , ἔφη , τ- ἐναντίον τούτου ἀχθοίμην ἄν σοι , εἰ αἰσθοίμην σιωπῶντα ἃ βούλοιο ἐρέσθαι .
Why, no; by the gods, no, he answered; on the contrary, I should be displeased with you if I found that you refrained from asking something that you wished to ask.


8.4.9
4529
λέγε δή μοι , ἔφη , ἤδη πώποτε καλέσαντός σου οὐκ ἦλθον ;
Tell me, then, said the other, did I ever fail to come when you sent for me?


8.4.9
4530
εὐφήμει , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
Hush! said Cyrus.


8.4.9
4531
ἀλλ’ ὑπακούων σχολῇ ὑπήκουσα ;
Or, obeying, did I ever obey reluctantly?


8.4.9
4532
οὐδὲ τοῦτο .
No; nor that.


8.4.9
4533
προσταχθὲν δέ τι ἤδη σοι οὐκ ἔπραξα ;
Or did I ever fail to do your bidding in anything?


8.4.9
4534
οὐκ αἰτιῶμαι , ἔφη .
I make no such accusation, answered Cyrus.


8.4.9
4535
ὃ δὲ πράττοιμι , ἔστιν ὅ τι πώποτε οὐ προθύμως ἢ οὐχ ἡδομένως πράττοντά με κατέγνως ;
And is there anything I did that you found me doing otherwise than eagerly or cheerfully?


8.4.9
4536
τοῦτο δὴ πάντων ἥκιστα , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
That, least of all, answered Cyrus.


8.4.10
4537
τίνος μὴν ἕνεκα , ἔφη , πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , ὦ Κῦρε , Χρυσάνταν ἔγραψας ὥστε εἰς τὴν τιμιωτέραν ἐμοῦ χώραν ἱδρυθῆναι ;
Then why, in heaven’s name, Cyrus, he said, did you put Chrysantas down for a more honourable place than mine?


8.4.10
4538
ἦ λέγω ;
Am I really to tell you?


8.4.10
4539
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
asked Cyrus.


8.4.10
4540
πάντως , ἔφη ὁ Ὑστάσπας .
By all means, answered Hystaspas.


8.4.10
4541
καὶ σὺ αὖ οὐκ ἀχθέσῃ μοι ἀκούων τ- ἀληθῆ ;
And you, on your part, will not be angry with me when you hear the truth?


8.4.11
4542
ἡσθήσομαι μὲν οὖν , ἔφη , ἢν εἰδῶ ὅτι οὐκ ἀδικοῦμαι .
Nay rather, said he, I shall be more than glad, if I find that I am not being slighted.


8.4.11
4543
Χρυσάντας τοίνυν , ἔφη , οὑτοσὶ πρῶτον μὲν οὐ κλῆσιν ἀνέμενεν , ἀλλὰ πρὶν καλεῖσθαι παρῆν τῶν ἡμετέρων ἕνεκα ·
Well then, said Cyrus, in the first place, Chrysantas here did not wait to be sent for, but presented himself for our service even before he was called;


8.4.11
4544
ἔπειτα δὲ οὐ τὸ κελευόμενον μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅ τι αὐτὸς γνοίη ἄμεινον εἶναι πεπραγμένον ἡμῖν τοῦτο ἔπραττεν .
and in the second place, he has always done not only what was ordered but all that he himself saw was better for us to have done.


8.4.11
4545
ὁπότε δὲ εἰπεῖν τι δέοι εἰς τοὺς συμμάχους , ἃ μὲν ἐμὲ ᾤετο πρέπειν λέγειν ἐμοὶ συνεβούλευεν ·
Again, whenever it was necessary to send some communication to the allies, he would give me advice as to what he thought proper for me to say;


8.4.11
4546
ἃ δὲ ἐμὲ αἴσθοιτο βουλόμενον μὲν εἰδέναι τοὺς συμμάχους , αὐτὸν δέ με αἰσχυνόμενον περὶ ἐμαυτοῦ λέγειν , ταῦτα οὗτος λέγων ὡς ἑαυτοῦ γνώμην ἀπεφαίνετο ·
and whenever he saw that I wished the allies to know about something, but that I felt some hesitation in saying anything about myself, he would always make it known to them, giving it as his own opinion.


8.4.11
4547
ὥστ’ ἔν γε τούτοις τί κωλύει αὐτὸν καὶ ἐμοῦ ἐμοὶ κρείττονα εἶναι ;
And so, in these matters at least, what reason is there why he should not be of more use to me even than I am myself?


8.4.11
4548
καὶ ἑαυτῷ μὲν ἀεί φησι πάντα τὰ παρόντα ἀρκεῖν , ἐμοὶ δὲ ἀεὶ φανερός ἐστι σκοπῶν τί ἂν προσγενόμενον ὀνήσειεν , ἐπί τε τοῖς ἐμοῖς καλοῖς πολὺ μᾶλλον ἐμοῦ ἀγάλλεται καὶ ἥδεται .
And finally, he always insists that what he has is enough for him, while he is manifestly always on the lookout for some new acquisition that would be of advantage to me, and takes much more pleasure and joy in my good fortune than I do myself.


8.4.12
4549
πρὸς ταῦτα ὁ Ὑστάσπας εἶπε ·
 Hystaspas said in reply:


8.4.12
4550
νὴ τὴν Ἥραν , ὦ Κῦρε , ἥδομαί γε ταῦτά σε ἐρωτήσας .
By Hera,  I am glad at any rate that I asked you this question, Cyrus.


8.4.12
4551
τί μάλιστα ;
Why so, pray? asked Cyrus.


8.4.12
4552
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
Because I too shall try to do as he does,


8.4.12
4553
ὅτι κ- ἐγὼ πειράσομαι ταῦτα ποιεῖν ·
said Cyrus.


8.4.12
4554
ἓν μόνον , ἔφη , ἀγνοῶ , πῶς ἂν εἴην δῆλος χαίρων ἐπὶ τοῖς σοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ·
Only I am not sure about one thing — I do not know how I could show that I rejoice at your good fortune.


8.4.12
4555
πότερον κροτεῖν δεῖ τὼ χεῖρε ἢ γελᾶν ἢ τί ποιεῖν .
Am I to clap my hands or laugh or what must I do?


8.4.12
4556
καὶ ὁ Ἀρτάβαζος εἶπεν ·
 Artabazus suggested.


8.4.12
4557
ὀρχεῖσθαι δεῖ τὸ Περσικόν .
You must dance the Persian dance,


8.4.12
4558
ἐπὶ τούτοις μὲν δὴ γέλως ἐγένετο .
At this, of course, there was a laugh.


8.4.13
4559
προϊόντος δὲ τοῦ συμποσίου ὁ Κῦρος τὸν Γωβρύαν ἐπήρετο ·
But, as the banquet proceeded, Cyrus put this question to Gobryas:


8.4.13
4560
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Γωβρύα , νῦν ἂν δοκεῖς ἥδιον τῶνδέ τῳ τὴν θυγατέρα δοῦναι ἢ ὅτε τὸ πρῶτον ἡμῖν συνεγένου ;
Tell me, Gobryas, said he, would you be more ready to consent now to give your daughter to one of my friends here than you were when first you joined us?


8.4.13
4561
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , κ- ἐγὼ τ- ἀληθῆ λέγω ;
Well, answered Gobryas, shall I also tell the truth?


8.4.13
4562
νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὡς ψεύδους γε οὐδεμία ἐρώτησις δεῖται .
Aye, by Zeus, answered Cyrus; surely no question calls for a falsehood.


8.4.13
4563
εὖ τοίνυν , ἔφη , ἴσθι ὅτι νῦν ἂν πολὺ ἥδιον .
Well, then, he replied, I should consent much more readily now, I assure you.


8.4.13
4564
ἦ καὶ ἔχοις ἄν , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , εἰπεῖν διότι ;
And would you mind telling us why? asked Cyrus.


8.4.14
4565
ἔγωγε .
Certainly not.


8.4.14
4566
λέγε δή .
Tell us, then.


8.4.14
4567
ὅτι τότε μὲν ἑώρων τοὺς πόνους καὶ τοὺς κινδύνους εὐθύμως αὐτοὺς φέροντας , νῦν δὲ ὁρῶ αὐτοὺς τ- ἀγαθὰ σωφρόνως φέροντας .
Because, while at that time I saw them bear toils and dangers with cheerfulness, now I see them bear their good fortune with self-control.


8.4.14
4568
δοκεῖ δέ μοι , ὦ Κῦρε , χαλεπώτερον εἶναι εὑρεῖν ἄνδρα τ- ἀγαθὰ καλῶς φέροντα ἢ τὰ κακά ·
And to me, Cyrus, it seems harder to find a man who can bear good fortune well than one who can bear misfortune well;


8.4.14
4569
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ὕβριν τοῖς πολλοῖς , τὰ δὲ σωφροσύνην τοῖς πᾶσιν ἐμποιεῖ .
for it is the former that engenders arrogance in most men; it is the latter that inspires in all men self-control.


8.4.15
4570
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
asked Cyrus.


8.4.15
4571
ἤκουσας , ὦ Ὑστάσπα , Γωβρύου τὸ ῥῆμα ;
Hystaspas, did you hear that saying of Gobryas?


8.4.15
4572
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ·
Yes, by Zeus, he answered;


8.4.15
4573
καὶ ἐὰν πολλὰ τοιαῦτά γε λέγῃ , πολὺ μᾶλλόν με τῆς θυγατρὸς μνηστῆρα λήψεται ἢ ἐὰν ἐκπώματα πολλά μοι ἐπιδεικνύῃ .
and if he has many such things to say, he will find me a suitor for his daughter’s hand much sooner than he would if he should exhibit to me a great number of goblets.


8.4.16
4574
ἦ μήν , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας , πολλά γέ μοί ἐστι τοιαῦτα συγγεγραμμένα , ὧν ἐγώ σοι οὐ φθονήσω , ἢν τὴν θυγατέρα μου γυναῖκα λαμβάνῃς ·
I promise you, said Gobryas, that I have a great number of such saws written down, and I will not begrudge them to you, if you get my daughter to be your wife.


8.4.16
4575
τὰ δ’ ἐκπώματα , ἔφη , ἐπειδὴ οὐκ ἀνέχεσθαί μοι φαίνει , οὐκ οἶδ’ εἰ Χρυσάντᾳ τουτῳῒ δῶ , ἐπεὶ καὶ τὴν ἕδραν σου ὑφήρπασε .
But as to the goblets, said he, inasmuch as you do not seem to appreciate them, I rather think I shall give them to Chrysantas here, since he also has usurped your place at table.


8.4.17
4576
καὶ μὲν δή , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ὦ Ὑστάσπα , καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι δὲ οἱ παρόντες , ἢν ἐμοὶ λέγητε , ὅταν τις ὑμῶν γαμεῖν ἐπιχειρήσῃ , γνώσεσθε ὁποῖός τις κ- ἐγὼ συνεργὸς ὑμῖν ἔσομαι .
And what is more, Hystaspas — yes, and you others here,  said Cyrus ,  if you will let me know whenever any one of you is proposing to marry, you will discover what manner of assistant I, too, shall be to you.


8.4.18
4577
καὶ ὁ Γωβρύας εἶπεν ·
Gobryas said:


8.4.18
4578
ἢν δέ τις ἐκδοῦναι βούληται θυγατέρα , πρὸς τίνα δεῖ λέγειν ;
And if anyone has a daughter to give in marriage, to whom is he to apply?


8.4.18
4579
πρὸς ἐμέ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , καὶ τοῦτο ·
To me, said Cyrus;


8.4.18
4580
πάνυ γάρ , ἔφη , δεινός εἰμι ταύτην τὴν τέχνην .
for I am exceedingly skilled in that art.


8.4.19
4581
ποίαν ;
What art?


8.4.19
4582
ἔφη ὁ Χρυσάντας .
asked Chrysantas.


8.4.19
4583
τὸ γνῶναι ὁποῖος ἂν γάμος ἑκάστῳ συναρμόσειε .
In knowing what sort of match would suit each one of you.


8.4.19
4584
καὶ ὁ Χρυσάντας ἔφη ·
Chrysantas said:


8.4.19
4585
λέγε δὴ πρὸς τῶν θεῶν ποίαν τινά μοι γυναῖκα οἴει συναρμόσειν κάλλιστα .
Tell me, then, for heaven’s sake,  what sort of wife you think would suit me best.


8.4.20
4586
πρῶτον μέν , ἔφη , μικράν ·
In the first place, said he, she must be small;


8.4.20
4587
μικρὸς γὰρ καὶ αὐτὸς εἶ ·
for you are small yourself;


8.4.20
4588
εἰ δὲ μεγάλην γαμεῖς , ἤν ποτε βούλῃ αὐτὴν ὀρθὴν φιλῆσαι , προσάλλεσθαί σε δεήσει ὥσπερ τὰ κυνάρια .
and if you marry a tall woman and wish to kiss her when she is standing up straight, you will have to jump for it, like a puppy.


8.4.20
4589
τοῦτο μὲν δή , ἔφη , ὀρθῶς προνοεῖς ·
You are quite right in that provision for me, said he;


8.4.20
4590
καὶ γὰρ οὐδ’ ὁπωστιοῦν ἁλτικός εἰμι .
and I should never get my kiss, for I am no jumper at all.


8.4.21
4591
ἔπειτα δ’ , ἔφη , σιμὴ ἄν σοι ἰσχυρῶς συμφέροι .
And in the next place, said Cyrus, a snub-nosed woman would suit you admirably.


8.4.21
4592
πρὸς τί δὴ αὖ τοῦτο ;
Why so?


8.4.21
4593
ὅτι , ἔφη , σὺ γρυπὸς εἶ ·
Because, was the answer, your own nose is so hooked;


8.4.21
4594
πρὸς οὖν τὴν σιμότητα σάφ’ ἴσθι ὅτι ἡ γρυπότης ἄριστ’ ἂν προσαρμόσειε .
and hookedness, I assure you, would be the very proper mate for snubbiness.


8.4.21
4595
λέγεις σύ , ἔφη , ὡς καὶ τῷ εὖ δεδειπνηκότι ὥσπερ καὶ ἐγὼ νῦν ἄδειπνος ἂν συναρμόττοι .
Do you mean to say also, said the other, that a supperless wife would suit one who has had a good dinner, like me now?


8.4.21
4596
ναὶ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος ·
Aye, by Zeus, answered Cyrus;


8.4.21
4597
τῶν μὲν γὰρ μεστῶν γρυπὴ ἡ γαστὴρ γίγνεται , τῶν δὲ ἀδείπνων σιμή .
for the stomach of one who has eaten heartily bows out, but that of one who has not eaten bows in.


8.4.22
4598
καὶ ὁ Χρυσάντας ἔφη ·
Chrysantas said:


8.4.22
4599
ψυχρῷ δ’ ἄν , πρὸς τῶν θεῶν , βασιλεῖ ἔχοις ἂν εἰπεῖν ποία τις συνοίσει ;
Then, in heaven’s name,  could you tell us what sort of wife would suit a frigid king?


8.4.22
4600
ἐνταῦθα μὲν δὴ ὅ τε Κῦρος ἐξεγέλασε καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ὁμοίως .
At this, of course, Cyrus burst out laughing, as did also all the rest.


8.4.23
4601
γελώντων δὲ ἅμα εἶπεν ὁ Ὑστάσπας ·
I envy you for that, Cyrus, said Hystaspas while they were still laughing,


8.4.23
4602
πολύ γ’ , ἔφη , μάλιστα τούτου σε , ὦ Κῦρε , ζηλῶ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ .
more than for anything else in your kingdom.


8.4.23
4603
τίνος ;
Envy me for what?


8.4.23
4604
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος .
asked Cyrus.


8.4.23
4605
ὅτι δύνασαι καὶ ψυχρὸς ὢν γέλωτα παρέχειν .
Why, that, frigid as you are, you can still make us laugh.


8.4.23
4606
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπεν ·
Well, said Cyrus,


8.4.23
4607
ἔπειτ’ οὐκ ἂν πρίαιό γε παμπόλλου ὥστε σοὶ ταῦτ’ εἰρῆσθαι , καὶ ἀπαγγελθῆναι παρ’ ᾗ εὐδοκιμεῖν βούλει ὅτι ἀστεῖος εἶ ;
and would you not give a great deal to have made these jokes and to have them reported to the lady with whom you wish to have the reputation of being a witty fellow?


8.4.23
4608
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οὕτω διεσκώπτετο .
Thus, then, these pleasantries were exchanged.


8.4.24
4609
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα Τιγράνῃ μὲν ἐξήνεγκε γυναικεῖον κόσμον , καὶ ἐκέλευσε τῇ γυναικὶ δοῦναι , ὅτι ἀνδρείως συνεστρατεύετο τῷ ἀνδρί , Ἀρταβάζῳ δὲ χρυσοῦν ἔκπωμα , τῷ δ’ Ὑρκανίῳ ἵππον καὶ ἄλλα πολλὰ καὶ καλὰ ἐδωρήσατο .
After this he brought out some articles of feminine adornment for Tigranes and bade him give them to his wife, because she had so bravely accompanied her husband throughout the campaigns;


8.4.24
4610
σοὶ δέ , ἔφη , ὦ Γωβρύα , δώσω ἄνδρα τῇ θυγατρί .
to Artabazus he gave a golden goblet and to the Hyrcanian a horse and many other beautiful presents. And you, Gobryas, he said, I will present with a husband for your daughter.


8.4.25
4611
οὐκοῦν ἐμέ , ἔφη ὁ Ὑστάσπας , δώσεις , ἵνα καὶ τὰ συγγράμματα λάβω .
You will please present him with me, then, will you not, said Hystaspas, that so I may get the collection of proverbs?


8.4.25
4612
ἦ καὶ ἔστι σοι , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , οὐσία ἀξία τῶν τῆς παιδός ;
Ah, but have you property enough to match the girl’s fortune? asked Cyrus.


8.4.25
4613
νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , πολλαπλασίων μὲν οὖν χρημάτων .
Yes, by Zeus, he answered, and several times over.


8.4.25
4614
καὶ ποῦ , ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος , ἔστι σοι αὕτη ἡ οὐσία ;
And where is this property of yours? asked Cyrus.


8.4.25
4615
ἐνταῦθα , ἔφη , ὅπουπερ καὶ σὺ κάθησαι φίλος ὢν ἐμοί .
Right there, said he, in your chair; for you are a friend of mine.


8.4.25
4616
ἀρκεῖ μοι , ἔφη ὁ Γωβρύας ·
I am satisfied, said Gobryas;


8.4.25
4617
καὶ εὐθὺς ἐκτείνας τὴν δεξιάν , δίδου , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε ·
and at once stretching out his right hand he added: Give him to me, Cyrus;


8.4.25
4618
δέχομαι γάρ .
I will accept him.


8.4.26
4619
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν τὴν τοῦ Ὑστάσπου δεξιὰν ἔδωκε τῷ Γωβρύᾳ , ὁ δ’ ἐδέξατο .
And Cyrus took Hystaspas by the right hand and placed it in the hand of Gobryas, and he received it.


8.4.26
4620
ἐκ δὲ τούτου πολλὰ καὶ καλὰ ἔδωκε δῶρα τῷ Ὑστάσπᾳ , ὅπως τῇ παιδὶ πέμψειε ·
And then Cyrus gave Hystaspas many splendid gifts to send to the young lady.


8.4.26
4621
Χρυσάνταν δ’ ἐφίλησε προσαγαγόμενος .
But Chrysantas he drew to himself and kissed him.


8.4.26
4622
καὶ ὁ Ἀρτάβαζος εἶπε ·
Artabazus cried:


8.4.26
4623
μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , οὐχ ὁμοίου γε χρυσοῦ ἐμοί τε τὸ ἔκπωμα δέδωκας καὶ Χρυσάντᾳ τὸ δῶρον .
By Zeus, Cyrus, the cup which you have given me is not of the same gold as the present you have given Chrysantas!


8.4.27
4624
ἀλλὰ καὶ σοί , ἔφη , δώσω .
Well, said he, I will give you the same gift.


8.4.27
4625
ἐπήρετο ἐκεῖνος πότε ;
When? asked the other.


8.4.27
4626
εἰς τριακοστόν , ἔφη , ἔτος .
Thirty years from now, was the answer.


8.4.27
4627
ὡς ἀναμενοῦντος , ἔφη , καὶ οὐκ ἀποθανουμένου οὕτω παρασκευάζου .
I shall wait for it, then, said he, and not die before I get it; so be getting ready.


8.4.27
4628
καὶ τότε μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἔληξεν ἡ σκηνή ·
And thus that banquet came to an end.


8.4.27
4629
ἐξανισταμένων δ’ αὐτῶν ἐξανέστη καὶ ὁ Κῦρος καὶ ξυμπρούπεμψεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας .
And as they rose to depart, Cyrus also rose and escorted them to the doors.


8.4.28
4630
τῇ δὲ ὑστεραίᾳ τοὺς ἐθελουσίους συμμάχους γενομένους ἀπέπεμπεν οἴκαδε ἑκάστους , πλὴν ὅσοι αὐτῶν οἰκεῖν ἐβούλοντο παρ’ αὐτῷ ·
On the following day he dismissed to their several homes all those who had volunteered to be his allies, except such as wished to settle near him.


8.4.28
4631
τούτοις δὲ χώραν καὶ οἴκους ἔδωκε , καὶ νῦν ἔτι ἔχουσιν οἱ τῶν καταμεινάντων τότε ἀπόγονοι ·
To those who stayed he gave houses and lands which even to this day are in the possession of their descendants;


8.4.28
4632
πλεῖστοι δ’ εἰσὶ Μήδων καὶ Ὑρκανίων ·
these, moreover, were mostly Medes and Hyrcanians.


8.4.28
4633
τοῖς δ’ ἀπιοῦσι δωρησάμενος πολλὰ καὶ ἀμέμπτους ποιησάμενος καὶ ἄρχοντας καὶ στρατιώτας ἀπεπέμψατο .
And to those who went home he gave many presents and sent both officers and privates well contented on their way.


8.4.29
4634
ἐκ τούτου δὲ διέδωκε καὶ τοῖς περὶ αὑτὸν στρατιώταις τὰ χρήματα ὅσα ἐκ Σάρδεων ἔλαβε ·
Next he divided also among his own soldiers the spoil that he had obtained at Sardis.


8.4.29
4635
καὶ τοῖς μὲν μυριάρχοις καὶ τοῖς περὶ αὑτὸν ὑπηρέταις ἐξαίρετα ἐδίδου πρὸς τὴν ἀξίαν ἑκάστῳ , τὰ δ’ ἄλλα διένειμε ·
To the generals and to his own aides-de-camp he gave the choicest portions — to each, according to his merit — and then distributed the rest;


8.4.29
4636
καὶ τὸ μέρος ἑκάστῳ δοὺς τῶν μυριάρχων ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτοῖς διανέμειν ὥσπερ αὐτὸς ἐκείνοις διένειμεν .
and in assigning to the generals their proper portions he left it to their discretion to distribute it as he had distributed to them.


8.4.30
4637
ἐδίδοσαν δὲ τὰ μὲν ἄλλα χρήματα ἄρχων ἄρχοντας τοὺς ὑφ’ ἑαυτῷ δοκιμάζων ·
And they apportioned all the rest, each officer examining into the merits of his subordinate officers;


8.4.30
4638
τὰ δὲ τελευταῖα οἱ ἑξάδαρχοι τοὺς ὑφ’ ἑαυτοῖς ἰδιώτας δοκιμάσαντες πρὸς τὴν ἀξίαν ἑκάστῳ ἐδίδοσαν ·
and what was left to the last, the corporals, inquiring into the merits of the private soldiers under their command, gave to each according to his deserts.


8.4.30
4639
καὶ οὕτω πάντες εἰλήφεσαν τὸ δίκαιον μέρος .
And so all were in receipt of their fair share.


8.4.31
4640
ἐπεὶ δὲ εἰλήφεσαν τὰ τότε δοθέντα , οἱ μέν τινες ἔλεγον περὶ τοῦ Κύρου τοιάδε ·
And when they had received what was then given them, some spoke concerning Cyrus in this vein:


8.4.31
4641
ἦ που αὐτός γε πολλὰ ἔχει , ὅπου γε καὶ ἡμῶν ἑκάστῳ τοσαῦτα δέδωκεν ·
He must be keeping an abundance himself, one would think, seeing that he has given so much to each one of us.


8.4.31
4642
οἱ δέ τινες αὐτῶν ἔλεγον ·
Abundance, indeed! some others would say;


8.4.31
4643
ποῖα πολλὰ ἔχει ;
Cyrus is not of the sort to make money for himself;


8.4.31
4644
οὐχ ὁ Κύρου τρόπος τοιοῦτος οἷος χρηματίζεσθαι , ἀλλὰ διδοὺς μᾶλλον ἢ κτώμενος ἥδεται .
he takes more pleasure in giving than in keeping.


8.4.32
4645
αἰσθόμενος δὲ ὁ Κῦρος τούτους τοὺς λόγους καὶ τὰς δόξας τὰς περὶ αὑτοῦ συνέλεξε τοὺς φίλους τε καὶ τοὺς ἐπικαιρίους ἅπαντας καὶ ἔλεξεν ὧδε .
And when Cyrus heard of these remarks and opinions about himself, he called together his friends and all his staff-officers and addressed them as follows:


8.4.32
4646
ὦ ἄνδρες φίλοι , ἑώρακα μὲν ἤδη ἀνθρώπους οἳ βούλονται δοκεῖν πλείω κεκτῆσθαι ἢ ἔχουσιν , ἐλευθεριώτεροι ἂν οἰόμενοι οὕτω φαίνεσθαι ·
My friends, I have in my time seen fellows who wished to have the reputation of possessing more than they had, for they supposed that they would thus be thought fine gentlemen;


8.4.32
4647
ἐμοὶ δὲ δοκοῦσιν , ἔφη , οὗτοι τ- ἔμπαλιν οὗ βούλονται ἐφέλκεσθαι ·
but to me, said he, it seems that such persons bring upon themselves the very reverse of what they wish.


8.4.32
4648
τὸ γὰρ πολλὰ δοκοῦντα ἔχειν μὴ κατ’ ἀξίαν τῆς οὐσίας φαίνεσθαι ὠφελοῦντα τοὺς φίλους ἀνελευθερίαν ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ περιάπτειν .
For if any man enjoy the reputation of having great wealth and do not appear to help his friends in a manner worthy of his abundance — that, it seems to me at least, fixes upon him the stigma of being a mean sort.


8.4.33
4649
εἰσὶ δ’ αὖ , ἔφη , οἳ λεληθέναι βούλονται ὅσα ἂν ἔχωσι ·
On the other hand, he continued, there are some who wish to keep it a secret how much they do possess.


8.4.33
4650
πονηροὶ οὖν καὶ οὗτοι τοῖς φίλοις ἔμοιγε δοκοῦσιν εἶναι .
It seems to me, then, that these also are mean toward their friends.


8.4.33
4651
διὰ γὰρ τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι τὰ ὄντα πολλάκις δεόμενοι οὐκ ἐπαγγέλλουσιν οἱ φίλοι τοῖς ἑταίροις , ἀλλὰ τητῶνται .
For oftentimes their friends are in need and, because they are ignorant of the truth, they say nothing to their comrades about their difficulties, and really suffer want.


8.4.34
4652
ἁπλουστάτου δέ μοι , ἔφη , δοκεῖ εἶναι τὸ τὴν δύναμιν φανερὰν ποιήσαντα ἐκ ταύτης ἀγωνίζεσθαι περὶ καλοκἀγαθίας .
To me, however, he went on, it seems the most straightforward way for a man to let the extent of his means be known and to strive in proportion to them to show himself a gentleman.


8.4.34
4653
κ- ἐγὼ οὖν , ἔφη , βούλομαι ὑμῖν ὅσα μὲν οἷόν τ’ ἐστὶν ἰδεῖν τῶν ἐμοὶ ὄντων δεῖξαι , ὅσα δὲ μὴ οἷόν τε ἰδεῖν , διηγήσασθαι .
And so I wish to show you all that I have, as far as it is possible for you to see, and to give you an account of it, in so far as it is impossible for you to see it.


8.4.35
4654
ταῦτα εἰπὼν τὰ μὲν ἐδείκνυε πολλὰ καὶ καλὰ κτήματα ·
With these words, he showed them many splendid possessions


8.4.35
4655
τὰ δὲ κείμενα ὡς μὴ ῥᾴδια εἶναι ἰδεῖν διηγεῖτο ·
and gave them an account of those that were so stored away as not to be easily viewed.


8.4.36
4656
τέλος δ’ εἶπεν ὧδε ·
And in conclusion he said:


8.4.36
4657
ταῦτα , ὦ ἄνδρες , ἅπαντα δεῖ ὑμᾶς οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἐμὰ ἡγεῖσθαι ἢ καὶ ὑμέτερα ·
All this, my friends, you must consider mine no more than your own;


8.4.36
4658
ἐγὼ γάρ , ἔφη , ταῦτα ἁθροίζω οὔθ’ ὅπως αὐτὸς καταδαπανήσω οὔθ’ ὅπως αὐτὸς κατατρίψω ·
for I have been collecting it, not that I might spend it all myself or use it up all alone (for I could not),


8.4.36
4659
οὐ γὰρ ἂν δυναίμην ·
but that I might on every occasion be able to reward any one of you who does something meritorious,


8.4.36
4660
ἀλλ’ ὅπως ἔχω τῷ τε ἀεὶ καλόν τι ὑμῶν ποιοῦντι διδόναι καὶ ὅπως , ἤν τις ὑμῶν τινος ἐνδεῖσθαι νομίσῃ , πρὸς ἐμὲ ἐλθὼν λάβῃ οὗ ἂν ἐνδεὴς τυγχάνῃ ὤν .
and also that, if any one of you thinks he needs something, he might come to me and get whatever he happens to want.


8.4.36
4661
καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δὴ οὕτως ἐλέχθη .
Such was his speech.


8.5.1
4662
ἡνίκα δὲ ἤδη αὐτῷ ἐδόκει καλῶς ἔχειν τὰ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι ὡς καὶ ἀποδημεῖν , συνεσκευάζετο τὴν εἰς Πέρσας πορείαν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις παρήγγειλεν ·
When it seemed to him that affairs in Babylon were sufficiently well organized for him to absent himself from the city, he began to make preparations for his journey to Persia and issued instructions to the others accordingly.


8.5.1
4663
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐνόμισεν ἱκανὰ ἔχειν ὧν ᾤετο δεήσεσθαι , οὕτω δὴ ἀνεζεύγνυε .
And as soon as he had got together in sufficient quantity, as he believed, everything that he thought he should need, he started at once.


8.5.2
4664
διηγησόμεθα δὲ καὶ ταῦτα ὡς πολὺς στόλος ὢν εὐτάκτως μὲν κατεσκευάζετο καὶ πάλιν ἀνεσκευάζετο , ταχὺ δὲ κατεχωρίζετο ὅπου δέοι .
We will relate here in how orderly a manner his train packed up, large though it was, and how quickly they reached the place where they were due.


8.5.2
4665
ὅπου γὰρ ἂν στρατοπεδεύηται βασιλεύς , σκηνὰς μὲν δὴ ἔχοντες πάντες οἱ ἀμφὶ βασιλέα στρατεύονται καὶ θέρους καὶ χειμῶνος .
For wherever the great king encamps, all his retinue follow him to the field with their tents, whether in summer or in winter.


8.5.3
4666
εὐθὺς δὲ τοῦτο ἐνόμιζε Κῦρος , πρὸς ἕω βλέπουσαν ἵστασθαι τὴν σκηνήν ·
At the very beginning Cyrus made this rule, that his tent should be pitched facing the east;


8.5.3
4667
ἔπειτα ἔταξε πρῶτον μὲν πόσον δεῖ ἀπολιπόντας σκηνοῦν τοὺς δορυφόρους τῆς βασιλικῆς σκηνῆς ·
and then he determined, first, how far from the royal pavilion the spearmen of his guard should have their tent;


8.5.3
4668
ἔπειτα σιτοποιοῖς μὲν χώραν ἀπέδειξε τὴν δεξιάν , ὀψοποιοῖς δὲ τὴν ἀριστεράν , ἵπποις δὲ τὴν δεξιάν , ὑποζυγίοις δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις τὴν ἀριστεράν ·
next he assigned a place on the right for the bakers, on the left for the cooks, on the right for the horses, and on the left for the rest of the pack-animals.


8.5.3
4669
καὶ τ- ἄλλα δὲ διετέτακτο ὥστε εἰδέναι ἕκαστον τὴν ἑαυτοῦ χώραν καὶ μέτρῳ καὶ τόπῳ .
And everything else was so organized that every one knew his own place in camp — both its size and its location.


8.5.4
4670
ὅταν δὲ ἀνασκευάζωνται , συντίθησι μὲν ἕκαστος σκεύη οἷσπερ τέτακται χρῆσθαι , ἀνατίθενται δ’ αὖ ἄλλοι ἐπὶ τὰ ὑποζύγια ·
And when they come to pack up again, every one gets together the things that it is his business to use and others in turn pack them upon the animals,


8.5.4
4671
ὥσθ’ ἅμα μὲν πάντες ἔρχονται οἱ σκευαγωγοὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τεταγμένα ἄγειν , ἅμα δὲ πάντες ἀνατιθέασιν ἐπὶ τὰ ἑαυτοῦ ἕκαστος .
so that the baggage-men all come at the same time to the things they were appointed to transport, and all at the same time pack the things upon their several animals.


8.5.4
4672
οὕτω δὴ ὁ αὐτὸς χρόνος ἀρκεῖ μιᾷ τε σκηνῇ καὶ πάσαις ἀνῃρῆσθαι .
Thus the amount of time needed for striking a single tent suffices for all.


8.5.5
4673
ὡσαύτως οὕτως ἔχει καὶ περὶ κατασκευῆς .
The unpacking also is managed in this same manner;


8.5.5
4674
καὶ περὶ τοῦ πεποιῆσθαι δὲ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια πάντα ἐν καιρῷ ὡσαύτως διατέτακται ἑκάστοις τὰ ποιητέα ·
and in order to have all the necessaries ready at the right time, each one has assigned to him likewise the part that he is to do.


8.5.5
4675
καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὁ αὐτὸς χρόνος ἀρκεῖ ἑνί τε μέρει καὶ πᾶσι πεποιῆσθαι .
In this way the time required for doing any one part is sufficient for getting all the provisions ready.


8.5.6
4676
ὥσπερ δὲ οἱ περὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια θεράποντες χώραν εἶχον τὴν προσήκουσαν ἕκαστοι , οὕτω καὶ οἱ ὁπλοφόροι αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ στρατοπεδεύσει χώραν τε εἶχον τὴν τῇ ὁπλίσει ἑκάστῃ ἐπιτηδείαν , καὶ ᾔδεσαν ταύτην ὁποία ἦν , καὶ ἐπ’ ἀναμφισβήτητον πάντες κατεχωρίζοντο .
And just as the servants in charge of the provisions had each his proper place, so also his soldiers had when they encamped the places suitable to each sort of troops; they knew their places, too, and so all found them without the slightest friction.


8.5.7
4677
καλὸν μὲν γὰρ ἡγεῖτο ὁ Κῦρος καὶ ἐν οἰκίᾳ εἶναι ἐπιτήδευμα τὴν εὐθημοσύνην ·
For Cyrus considered orderliness to be a good thing to practise in the management of a household also;


8.5.7
4678
ὅταν γάρ τίς του δέηται , δῆλόν ἐστι ὅπου δεῖ ἐλθόντα λαβεῖν ·
for whenever any one wants a thing, he then knows where he must go to find it;


8.5.7
4679
πολὺ δ’ ἔτι κάλλιον ἐνόμιζε τὴν τῶν στρατιωτικῶν φύλων εὐθημοσύνην εἶναι , ὅσῳ τε ὀξύτεροι οἱ καιροὶ τῶν εἰς τὰ πολεμικὰ χρήσεων καὶ μείζω τὰ σφάλματα τὰ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑστεριζόντων ἐν αὐτοῖς ·
but he believed that orderliness in all the departments of an army was a much better thing, inasmuch as the chances of a successful stroke in war come and go more quickly and the losses occasioned by those who are behindhand in military matters are more serious.


8.5.7
4680
ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ἐν καιρῷ παραγιγνομένων πλείστου ἄξια πλεονεκτήματα ἑώρα γιγνόμενα ἐν τοῖς πολεμικοῖς ·
He also saw that the advantages gained in war by prompt attention to duty were most important.


8.5.7
4681
διὰ ταῦτα οὖν καὶ ἐπεμέλετο ταύτης τῆς εὐθημοσύνης μάλιστα .
It was for this reason, therefore, that he took especial pains to secure this sort of orderliness.


8.5.8
4682
καὶ αὐτὸς μὲν δὴ πρῶτον ἑαυτὸν ἐν μέσῳ κατετίθετο τοῦ στρατοπέδου , ὡς ταύτης τῆς χώρας ἐχυρωτάτης οὔσης ·
Accordingly, he himself first took up his position in the middle of the camp in the belief that this situation was the most secure.


8.5.8
4683
ἔπειτα δὲ τοὺς μὲν πιστοτάτους ὥσπερ εἰώθει περὶ ἑαυτὸν εἶχε , τούτων δ’ ἐν κύκλῳ ἐχομένους ἱππέας τ’ εἶχε καὶ ἁρματηλάτας .
Then came his most trusty followers, just as he was accustomed to have them about him at home, and next to them in a circle he had his horsemen and charioteers;


8.5.9
4684
καὶ γὰρ τούτους ἐχυρᾶς ἐνόμιζε χώρας δεῖσθαι , ὅτι σὺν οἷς μάχονται ὅπλοις οὐδὲν πρόχειρον ἔχοντες τούτων στρατοπεδεύονται , ἀλλὰ πολλοῦ χρόνου δέονται εἰς τὴν ἐξόπλισιν , εἰ μέλλουσι χρησίμως ἕξειν .
for those troops also, he thought, need a secure position, because when they are in camp they do not have ready at hand any of the arms with which they fight, but need considerable time to arm, if they are to render effective service.


8.5.10
4685
ἐν δεξιᾷ δὲ καὶ ἐν ἀριστερᾷ αὐτοῦ τε καὶ τῶν ἱππέων πελτασταῖς χώρα ἦν ·
To the right and left from him and the cavalry was the place for the targeteers;


8.5.10
4686
τοξοτῶν δ’ αὖ χώρα ἡ πρόσθεν ἦν καὶ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ τε καὶ τῶν ἱππέων .
before and behind him and the cavalry, the place for the bowmen.


8.5.11
4687
ὁπλίτας δὲ καὶ τοὺς τὰ μεγάλα γέρρα ἔχοντας κύκλῳ πάντων εἶχεν ὥσπερ τεῖχος , ὅπως καὶ εἰ δέοι τι ἐνσκευάζεσθαι τοὺς ἱππέας , οἱ μονιμώτατοι πρόσθεν ὄντες παρέχοιεν αὐτοῖς ἀσφαλῆ τὴν καθόπλισιν .
The hoplites and those armed with the large shields he arranged around all the rest like a wall, so that those who could best hold their ground might, by being in front of them, make it possible for the cavalry to arm in safety, if it should be necessary.


8.5.12
4688
ἐκάθευδον δὲ αὐτῷ ἐν τάξει ὥσπερ οἱ ὁπλῖται , οὕτω δὲ καὶ οἱ πελτασταὶ καὶ οἱ τοξόται , ὅπως καὶ ἐκ νυκτῶν , εἰ δέοι τι , ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ ὁπλῖται παρεσκευασμένοι εἰσὶ παίειν τὸν εἰς χεῖρας ἰόντα , οὕτω καὶ οἱ τοξόται καὶ οἱ ἀκοντισταί , εἴ τινες προσίοιεν , ἐξ ἑτοίμου ἀκοντίζοιεν καὶ τοξεύοιεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ὁπλιτῶν .
Moreover, he had the peltasts and the bowmen sleep on their arms, like the hoplites, in order that, if there should be occasion to go into action even at night, they might be ready for it. And just as the hoplites were prepared to do battle if any one came within arm’s reach of them, so these troops also were to be ready to let fly their lances and arrows over the heads of the hoplites, if any one attacked.


8.5.13
4689
εἶχον δὲ καὶ σημεῖα πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐπὶ ταῖς σκηναῖς ·
And all the officers had banners over their tents;


8.5.13
4690
οἱ δ’ ὑπηρέται ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν οἱ σώφρονες ἴσασι μὲν καὶ τῶν πλείστων τὰς οἰκήσεις , μάλιστα δὲ τῶν ἐπικαιρίων , οὕτω καὶ τῶν ἐν τοῖς στρατοπέδοις τάς τε χώρας τὰς τῶν ἡγεμόνων ἠπίσταντο οἱ Κύρου ὑπηρέται καὶ τὰ σημεῖα ἐγίγνωσκον ἃ ἑκάστοις ἦν ·
and just as in the cities well-informed officials know the residences of most of the inhabitants and especially those of the most prominent citizens, so also in camp the aides under Cyrus were acquainted with the location of the various officers and were familiar with the banner of each one;


8.5.13
4691
ὥστε ὅτου δέοιτο Κῦρος , οὐκ ἐζήτουν , ἀλλὰ τὴν συντομωτάτην ἐφ’ ἕκαστον ἔθεον .
and so if Cyrus wanted one of his officers, they did not have to search for him but would run to him by the shortest way.


8.5.14
4692
καὶ διὰ τὸ εἰλικρινῆ ἕκαστα εἶναι τὰ φῦλα πολὺ μᾶλλον ἦν δῆλα καὶ ὁπότε τις εὐτακτοίη καὶ εἴ τις μὴ πράττοι τὸ προσταττόμενον .
And as every division was so well distinguished, it was much more easy to see where good order prevailed and where commands were not being executed.


8.5.14
4693
οὕτω δὴ ἐχόντων ἡγεῖτο , εἴ τις καὶ ἐπίθοιτο νυκτὸς ἢ ἡμέρας , ὥσπερ ἂν εἰς ἐνέδραν εἰς τὸ στρατόπεδον τοὺς ἐπιτιθεμένους ἐμπίπτειν .
Therefore, as things were arranged, he believed that if any enemy were to attack him either by night or by day, the attacking party would fall into his camp as into an ambuscade.


8.5.15
4694
καὶ τὸ τακτικὸν δὲ εἶναι οὐ τοῦτο μόνον ἡγεῖτο εἴ τις ἐκτεῖναι φάλαγγα εὐπόρως δύναιτο ἢ βαθῦναι ἢ ἐκ κέρατος εἰς φάλαγγα καταστῆσαι ἢ ἐκ δεξιᾶς ἢ ἀριστερᾶς ἢ ὄπισθεν ἐπιφανέντων πολεμίων ὀρθῶς ἐξελίξαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ διασπᾶν ὁπότε δέοι τακτικὸν ἡγεῖτο , καὶ τὸ τιθέναι γε τὸ μέρος ἕκαστον ὅπου μάλιστα ἐν ὠφελείᾳ ἂν εἴη , καὶ τὸ ταχύνειν δὲ ὅπου φθάσαι δέοι , πάντα ταῦτα καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα τακτικοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι καὶ ἐπεμελεῖτο τούτων πάντων ὁμοίως .
He believed also that tactics did not consist solely in being able easily to extend one’s line or increase its depth, or to change it from a long column into a phalanx, or without error to change the front by a counter march according as the enemy came up on the right or the left or behind; but he considered it also a part of good tactics to break up one’s army into several divisions whenever occasion demanded, and to place each division, too, where it would do the most good, and to make speed when it was necessary to reach a place before the enemy — all these and other such qualifications were essential, he believed, to a skilful tactician, and he devoted himself to them all alike.


8.5.16
4695
καὶ ἐν μὲν ταῖς πορείαις πρὸς τὸ συμπῖπτον ἀεὶ διατάττων ἐπορεύετο , ἐν δὲ τῇ στρατοπεδεύσει ὡς τὰ πολλὰ ὥσπερ εἴρηται κατεχώριζεν .
And so on his marches he always proceeded giving out his orders with a view to existing circumstances; but in camp his arrangements were made, for the most part, as has been described.


8.5.17
4696
ἐπεὶ δὲ πορευόμενοι γίγνονται κατὰ τὴν Μηδικήν , τρέπεται ὁ Κῦρος πρὸς Κυαξάρην .
As they continued their march and came near to Media, Cyrus turned aside to visit Cyaxares.


8.5.17
4697
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους , πρῶτον μὲν δὴ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε τῷ Κυαξάρῃ ὅτι οἶκος αὐτῷ ἐξῃρημένος εἴη ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ ἀρχεῖα , ὅπως ἔχῃ καὶ ὅταν ἐκεῖσε ἔλθῃ εἰς οἰκεῖα κατάγεσθαι ·
And when they had exchanged greetings, the first thing Cyrus told Cyaxares was that a palace had been selected for him in Babylon, and official headquarters, so that he might occupy a residence of his own whenever he came there;


8.5.17
4698
ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ ἄλλα δῶρα ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ πολλὰ καὶ καλά .
and then he also gave him many splendid presents.


8.5.18
4699
ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης ταῦτα μὲν ἐδέχετο , προσέπεμψε δὲ αὐτῷ τὴν θυγατέρα στέφανόν τε χρυσοῦν καὶ ψέλια φέρουσαν καὶ στρεπτὸν καὶ στολὴν Μηδικὴν ὡς δυνατὸν καλλίστην .
Cyaxares accepted them and then introduced to him his daughter, who brought him a golden crown and bracelets and a necklace and the most beautiful Median robe that could be found.


8.5.19
4700
καὶ ἡ μὲν δὴ παῖς ἐστεφάνου τὸν Κῦρον , ὁ δὲ Κυαξάρης εἶπε ·
As the princess placed the crown on Cyrus’s head, Cyaxares said,


8.5.19
4701
δίδωμι δέ σοι , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , καὶ αὐτὴν ταύτην γυναῖκα , ἐμὴν οὖσαν θυγατέρα ·
And the maiden herself, my own daughter, I offer you as well, Cyrus, to be your wife.


8.5.19
4702
καὶ ὁ σὸς δὲ πατὴρ ἔγημε τὴν τοῦ ἐμοῦ πατρὸς θυγατέρα , ἐξ ἧς σὺ ἐγένου ·
Your father married my father’s daughter, whose son you are.


8.5.19
4703
αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶν ἣν σὺ πολλάκις παῖς ὢν ὅτε παρ’ ἡμῖν ἦσθα ἐτιθηνήσω ·
This is she whom you used often to pet when you came to visit us when you were a boy.


8.5.19
4704
καὶ ὁπότε τις ἐρωτῴη αὐτὴν τίνι γαμοῖτο , ἔλεγεν ὅτι Κύρῳ ·
And whenever anybody asked her whom she was going to marry, she would say Cyrus.


8.5.19
4705
ἐπιδίδωμι δὲ αὐτῇ ἐγὼ καὶ φερνὴν Μηδίαν τὴν πᾶσαν ·
And with her I offer you all Media as a dowry,


8.5.19
4706
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἔστι μοι ἄρρην παῖς γνήσιος .
for I have no legitimate male issue.


8.5.20
4707
ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπεν ·
Thus he spoke,


8.5.20
4708
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἀπεκρίνατο ·
and Cyrus answered:


8.5.20
4709
ἀλλ’ , ὦ Κυαξάρη , τό τε γένος ἐπαινῶ καὶ τὴν παῖδα καὶ τὰ δῶρα ·
Well, Cyaxares, I heartily approve of your family and your daughter and your gifts.


8.5.20
4710
βούλομαι δέ , ἔφη , σὺν τῇ τοῦ πατρὸς γνώμῃ καὶ τῇ τῆς μητρὸς ταῦτά σοι συναινέσαι .
And I desire, with the approval of my father and mother, to accept your offer.


8.5.20
4711
εἶπε μὲν οὖν οὕτως ὁ Κῦρος , ὅμως δὲ τῇ παιδὶ πάντα ἐδωρήσατο ὁπόσα ᾤετο καὶ τῷ Κυαξάρῃ χαριεῖσθαι .
Thus Cyrus answered; but still he made the young lady presents of everything that he thought would please Cyaxares as well as herself.


8.5.20
4712
ταῦτα δὲ ποιήσας εἰς Πέρσας ἐπορεύετο .
And when he had done so, he proceeded on his way to Persia.


8.5.21
4713
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐπὶ τοῖς Περσῶν ὁρίοις ἐγένετο πορευόμενος , τὸ μὲν ἄλλο στράτευμα αὐτοῦ κατέλιπεν , αὐτὸς δὲ σὺν τοῖς φίλοις εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἐπορεύετο , ἱερεῖα μὲν ἄγων ὡς πᾶσι Πέρσαις ἱκανὰ θύειν τε καὶ ἑστιᾶσθαι ·
And when, as he continued his journey, he came to the boundaries of Persia, he left the main body of his army there, while he went on with his friends to the capital; and he took along animals enough for all the Persians to sacrifice and make a feast,


8.5.21
4714
δῶρα δ’ ἦγεν οἷα μὲν ἔπρεπε τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τῇ μητρὶ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις φίλοις , οἷα δ’ ἔπρεπεν ἀρχαῖς καὶ γεραιτέροις καὶ τοῖς ὁμοτίμοις πᾶσιν ·
and brought with him such gifts as were appropriate for his father and mother and his friends besides and such as were suitable for the authorities and the elders and all the peers.


8.5.21
4715
ἔδωκε δὲ καὶ πᾶσι Πέρσαις καὶ Περσίσιν ὅσαπερ καὶ νῦν ἔτι δίδωσιν ὅτανπερ ἀφίκηται βασιλεὺς εἰς Πέρσας .
And he gave presents also to all the Persians, men and women, such as even to this day the great king bestows whenever he comes to Persia.


8.5.22
4716
ἐκ δὲ τούτου συνέλεξε Καμβύσης τοὺς γεραιτέρους Περσῶν καὶ τὰς ἀρχάς , οἵπερ τῶν μεγίστων κύριοί εἰσι ·
Then Cambyses assembled the Persian elders and the highest of the chief magistrates;


8.5.22
4717
παρεκάλεσε δὲ καὶ Κῦρον , καὶ ἔλεξε τοιάδε .
he called in Cyrus also and then addressed them as follows:


8.5.22
4718
ἄνδρες Πέρσαι καὶ σύ , ὦ Κῦρε , ἐγὼ ἀμφοτέροις ὑμῖν εἰκότως εὔνους εἰμί ·
Toward you, my Persian friends, I cherish, as is natural, feelings of good-will,


8.5.22
4719
ὑμῶν μὲν γὰρ βασιλεύω , σὺ δέ , ὦ Κῦρε , παῖς ἐμὸς εἶ .
for I am your king; and no less toward you, Cyrus, for you are my son.


8.5.22
4720
δίκαιος οὖν εἰμι , ὅσα γιγνώσκειν δοκῶ ἀγαθὰ ἀμφοτέροις , ταῦτα εἰς τὸ μέσον λέγειν .
It is right, therefore, that I should declare frankly to you what I think I recognize to be for the good of both.


8.5.23
4721
τὰ μὲν γὰρ παρελθόντα ὑμεῖς μὲν Κῦρον ηὐξήσατε στράτευμα δόντες καὶ ἄρχοντα τούτου αὐτὸν καταστήσαντες , Κῦρος δὲ ἡγούμενος τούτου σὺν θεοῖς εὐκλεεῖς μὲν ὑμᾶς , ὦ Πέρσαι , ἐν πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐποίησεν , ἐντίμους δ’ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ πάσῃ ·
In the past you advanced the fortunes of Cyrus by giving him an army and placing him in command of it.


8.5.23
4722
τῶν δὲ συστρατευσαμένων αὐτῷ τοὺς μὲν ἀρίστους καὶ πεπλούτικε , τοῖς δὲ πολλοῖς μισθὸν καὶ τροφὴν παρεσκεύακεν ·
And at its head Cyrus has with the help of the gods given you, Persians, a good report among all men and made you honoured throughout all Asia.


8.5.23
4723
ἱππικὸν δὲ καταστήσας Περσῶν πεποίηκε Πέρσαις καὶ πεδίων εἶναι μετουσίαν .
Of those who went with him on his campaigns he has enriched the most deserving and to the commoners he has given wages and support; and by establishing a Persian cavalry force he has made the Persians masters also of the plains.


8.5.24
4724
ἢν μὲν οὖν καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν οὕτω γιγνώσκητε , πολλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν αἴτιοι ἀλλήλοις ἔσεσθε ·
If, therefore, you continue to be of the same mind also in the future, you will be the cause of much good to each other.


8.5.24
4725
εἰ δὲ ἢ σύ , ὦ Κῦρε , ἐπαρθεὶς ταῖς παρούσαις τύχαις ἐπιχειρήσεις καὶ Περσῶν ἄρχειν ἐπὶ πλεονεξίᾳ ὥσπερ τῶν ἄλλων , ἢ ὑμεῖς , ὦ πολῖται , φθονήσαντες τούτῳ τῆς δυνάμεως καταλύειν πειράσεσθε τοῦτον τῆς ἀρχῆς , εὖ ἴστε ὅτι ἐμποδὼν ἀλλήλοις πολλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν ἔσεσθε .
But, Cyrus, if you on your part become puffed up by your present successes and attempt to govern the Persians as you do those other nations, with a view to self-aggrandizement, or if you, fellow-citizens, become jealous of his power and attempt to depose him from his sovereignty, be sure that you will hinder one another from receiving much good.


8.5.25
4726
ὡς οὖν μὴ ταῦτα γίγνηται , ἀλλὰ τ- ἀγαθά , ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , ἔφη , θύσαντας ὑμᾶς κοινῇ καὶ θεοὺς ἐπιμαρτυραμένους συνθέσθαι , σὲ μέν , ὦ Κῦρε , ἤν τις ἐπιστρατεύηται χώρᾳ Περσίδι ἢ Περσῶν νόμους διασπᾶν πειρᾶται , βοηθήσειν παντὶ σθένει , ὑμᾶς δέ , ὦ Πέρσαι , ἤν τις ἢ ἀρχῆς Κῦρον ἐπιχειρῇ καταπαύειν ἢ ἀφίστασθαί τις τῶν ὑποχειρίων , βοηθήσειν καὶ ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς καὶ Κύρῳ καθ’ ὅ τι ἂν οὗτος ἐπαγγέλλῃ .
And that this may not befall you, but the good, it seems best to me for you to perform a common sacrifice and to make a covenant, first calling the gods to witness. You, Cyrus , on your part, must covenant that if any one sets hostile foot in Persia  or attempts to subvert the Persian constitution, you will come to her aid with all your strength; and you, Persians, on your part, are to covenant that if any one attempts to put an end to Cyrus’s sovereignty or if any one of his subjects attempts to revolt, you will come to your own rescue as well as Cyrus’s in whatsoever way he may call upon you.


8.5.26
4727
καὶ ἕως μὲν ἂν ἐγὼ ζῶ , ἐμὴ γίγνεται ἡ ἐν Πέρσαις βασιλεία ·
As long as I live, the Persian throne continues to be mine own.


8.5.26
4728
ὅταν δ’ ἐγὼ τελευτήσω , δῆλον ὅτι Κύρου , ἐὰν ζῇ .
But when I am dead, it will, of course, pass to Cyrus if he survives me.


8.5.26
4729
καὶ ὅταν μὲν οὗτος ἀφίκηται εἰς Πέρσας , ὁσίως ἂν ὑμῖν ἔχοι τοῦτον θύειν τὰ ἱερὰ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἅπερ νῦν ἐγὼ θύω ·
And as often as he comes to Persia, it should be a sacred custom with you that he sacrifice on your behalf even as I do now.


8.5.26
4730
ὅταν δ’ οὗτος ἔκδημος ᾖ , καλῶς ἂν οἶμαι ὑμῖν ἔχειν εἰ ἐκ τοῦ γένους ὃς ἂν δοκῇ ὑμῖν ἄριστος εἶναι , οὗτος τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἀποτελοίη .
And when he is away, it might be well for you, I think, that that one of our family who seems to you the most worthy should perform that sacred office.


8.5.27
4731
ταῦτα εἰπόντος Καμβύσου συνέδοξε Κύρῳ τε καὶ τοῖς Περσῶν τέλεσι ·
When Cambyses had finished speaking, Cyrus and the Persian magistrates accepted his proposal.


8.5.27
4732
καὶ συνθέμενοι ταῦτα τότε καὶ θεοὺς ἐπιμαρτυράμενοι οὕτω καὶ νῦν ἔτι διαμένουσι ποιοῦντες πρὸς ἀλλήλους Πέρσαι τε καὶ βασιλεύς .
And as they then covenanted, with the gods as their witnesses, so the Persians and their king still continue to this day to act toward one another.


8.5.27
4733
τούτων δὲ πραχθέντων ἀπῄει ὁ Κῦρος .
And when this had all been completed, Cyrus took his departure.


8.5.28
4734
ὡς δ’ ἀπιὼν ἐγένετο ἐν Μήδοις , συνδόξαν τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τῇ μητρὶ γαμεῖ τὴν Κυαξάρου θυγατέρα , ἧς ἔτι καὶ νῦν λόγος ὡς παγκάλης γενομένης .
When, on his way back, he came to Media, Cyrus wedded the daughter of Cyaxares, for he had obtained the consent of his father and mother. And to this day people still tell of her wonderful beauty.


8.5.28
4735
ἔνιοι δὲ τῶν λογοποιῶν λέγουσιν ὡς τὴν τῆς μητρὸς ἀδελφὴν ἔγημεν ·
But some historians say that he married his mother’s sister.


8.5.28
4736
ἀλλὰ γραῦς ἂν καὶ παντάπασιν ἦν ἡ παῖς .
But that maid must certainly have been a very old maid.


8.5.28
4737
γήμας δ’ εὐθὺς ἔχων ἀνεζεύγνυεν .
And when he was married he at once departed with his bride for Babylon.


8.6.1
4738
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι ἦν , ἐδόκει αὐτῷ σατράπας ἤδη πέμπειν ἐπὶ τὰ κατεστραμμένα ἔθνη .
When he arrived in Babylon, he decided to send out satraps to govern the nations he had subdued.


8.6.1
4739
τοὺς μέντοι ἐν ταῖς ἄκραις φρουράρχους καὶ τοὺς χιλιάρχους τῶν κατὰ τὴν χώραν φυλακῶν οὐκ ἄλλου ἢ ἑαυτοῦ ἐβούλετο ἀκούειν ·
But the commanders of the garrisons in the citadels and the colonels in command of the guards throughout the country he wished to be responsible to no one but himself.


8.6.1
4740
ταῦτα δὲ προεωρᾶτο ἐννοῶν ὅπως εἴ τις τῶν σατραπῶν ὑπὸ πλούτου καὶ πλήθους ἀνθρώπων ἐξυβρίσειε καὶ ἐπιχειρήσειε μὴ πείθεσθαι , εὐθὺς ἀντιπάλους ἔχοι ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ .
This provision he made with the purpose that if any of the satraps, on the strength of the wealth or the men at their command, should break out into open insolence or attempt to refuse obedience, they might at once find opposition in their province.


8.6.2
4741
ταῦτ’ οὖν βουλόμενος πρᾶξαι ἔγνω συγκαλέσαι πρῶτον τοὺς ἐπικαιρίους καὶ προειπεῖν , ὅπως εἰδεῖεν ἐφ’ οἷς ἴασιν οἱ ἰόντες ·
In the wish, therefore, to secure this result, he resolved first to call together his chief officers and inform them in advance, so that when they went they might know on what understanding they were going;


8.6.2
4742
ἐνόμιζε γὰρ οὕτω ῥᾷον φέρειν ἂν αὐτούς ·
for he believed that if he did so, they would take it more kindly;


8.6.2
4743
ἐπεὶ δὲ κατασταίη τις ἄρχων καὶ αἰσθάνοιτο ταῦτα , χαλεπῶς ἂν ἐδόκουν αὐτῷ φέρειν , νομίζοντες δι’ ἑαυτῶν ἀπιστίαν ταῦτα γενέσθαι .
whereas he thought that they might take it ill, if any of them discovered the conditions after being installed as satraps, for then they would think that this policy had been adopted from distrust of them personally.


8.6.3
4744
οὕτω δὴ συλλέξας λέγει αὐτοῖς τοιάδε .
And so he called them together and spoke as follows:


8.6.3
4745
ἄνδρες φίλοι , εἰσὶν ἡμῖν ἐν ταῖς κατεστραμμέναις πόλεσι φρουροὶ καὶ φρούραρχοι , οὓς τότε κατελίπομεν ·
My friends, we have in the subjugated states garrisons with their officers, whom we left behind there at the time;


8.6.3
4746
καὶ τούτοις ἐγὼ προστάξας ἀπῆλθον ἄλλο μὲν μηδὲν πολυπραγμονεῖν , τὰ δὲ τείχη διασῴζειν .
and when I came away I left them with orders not to trouble themselves with any business other than to hold the forts.


8.6.3
4747
τούτους μὲν οὖν οὐ παύσω τῆς ἀρχῆς , ἐπεὶ καλῶς διαπεφυλάχασι τὰ προσταχθέντα ·
These, therefore, I will not remove from their positions, for they have carried out my instructions faithfully;


8.6.3
4748
ἄλλους δὲ σατράπας πέμψαι μοι δοκεῖ , οἵτινες ἄρξουσι τῶν ἐνοικούντων καὶ τὸν δασμὸν λαμβάνοντες τοῖς τε φρουροῖς δώσουσι μισθὸν καὶ ἄλλο τελοῦσιν ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ .
but I have decided to send satraps there, besides, to govern the people, receive the tribute, pay the militia, and attend to any other business that needs attention.


8.6.4
4749
δοκεῖ δέ μοι καὶ τῶν ἐνθάδε μενόντων ὑμῶν , οἷς ἂν ἐγὼ πράγματα παρέχω πέμπων πράξοντάς τι ἐπὶ ταῦτα τὰ ἔθνη , χώρας γενέσθαι καὶ οἴκους ἐκεῖ , ὅπως δασμοφορῆταί τε αὐτοῖς δεῦρο , ὅταν τε ἴωσιν ἐκεῖσε , εἰς οἰκεῖα ἔχωσι κατάγεσθαι .
I have further decided that any of you who remain here, and to whom I may occasionally give the trouble of going on business for me to those nations, shall have lands and houses there; so that they may have tribute paid to them here and, whenever they go there, they may lodge in residences of their own.


8.6.5
4750
ταῦτα εἶπε καὶ ἔδωκε πολλοῖς τῶν φίλων κατὰ πάσας τὰς καταστραφείσας πόλεις οἴκους καὶ ὑπηκόους ·
Thus he spoke, and to many of his friends he gave houses and servants in the various states which he had subdued.


8.6.5
4751
καὶ νῦν εἰσιν ἔτι τοῖς ἀπογόνοις τῶν τότε λαβόντων αἱ χῶραι καταμένουσαι ἄλλαι ἐν ἄλλῃ γῇ ·
And even to this day those properties, some in one land, some in another, continue in the possession of the descendants of those who then received them,


8.6.5
4752
αὐτοὶ δὲ οἰκοῦσι παρὰ βασιλεῖ .
while the owners themselves reside at court.


8.6.6
4753
δεῖ δέ , ἔφη , τοὺς ἰόντας σατράπας ἐπὶ ταύτας τὰς χώρας τοιούτους ἡμᾶς σκοπεῖν οἵτινες ὅ τι ἂν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἑκάστῃ καλὸν ἢ ἀγαθὸν ᾖ , μεμνήσονται καὶ δεῦρο ἀποπέμπειν , ὡς μετέχωμεν καὶ οἱ ἐνθάδε ὄντες τῶν πανταχοῦ γιγνομένων ἀγαθῶν ·
And then, Cyrus resumed, we must take care that those who go as satraps to such countries shall be men of the right sort, who will bear in mind to send back here what there is good and desirable in their several provinces, in order that we also who remain here may have a share of the good things that are to be found everywhere.


8.6.6
4754
καὶ γὰρ ἤν τί που δεινὸν γίγνηται , ἡμῖν ἔσται ἀμυντέον .
And that will be no more than fair; for if any danger threatens anywhere, it is we who shall have to ward it off.


8.6.7
4755
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν τότε μὲν ἔπαυσε τὸν λόγον , ἔπειτα δὲ οὓς ἐγίγνωσκε τῶν φίλων ἐπὶ τοῖς εἰρημένοις ἐπιθυμοῦντας ἰέναι , ἐκλεξάμενος αὐτῶν τοὺς δοκοῦντας ἐπιτηδειοτάτους εἶναι ἔπεμπε σατράπας εἰς Ἀραβίαν μὲν Μεγάβυζον , εἰς Καππαδοκίαν δὲ Ἀρταβάταν , εἰς Φρυγίαν δὲ τὴν μεγάλην Ἀρτακάμαν , εἰς Λυδίαν δὲ καὶ Ἰωνίαν Χρυσάνταν , εἰς Καρίαν δὲ Ἀδούσιον , ὅνπερ ᾐτοῦντο , εἰς Φρυγίαν δὲ τὴν παρ’ Ἑλλήσποντον καὶ Αἰολίδα Φαρνοῦχον .
With these words he concluded his address on that occasion; and then he chose out from the number of his friends those whom he saw eager to go on the conditions named and who seemed to him best qualified, and sent them as satraps to the following countries: Megabyzus to Arabia , Artabatas to Cappadocia , Artacamas to Phrygia Major, Chrysantas to Lydia  and Ionia , Adusius to Caria  (it was he for whom the Carians had petitioned), and Pharnuchus to Aeolia  and Phrygia  on the Hellespont .


8.6.8
4756
Κιλικίας δὲ καὶ Κύπρου καὶ Παφλαγόνων οὐκ ἔπεμψε Πέρσας σατράπας , ὅτι ἑκόντες ἐδόκουν συστρατεῦσαι ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα ·
He sent out no Persians as satraps over Cilicia or Cyprus or Paphlagonia, because these he thought joined his expedition against Babylon voluntarily;


8.6.8
4757
δασμοὺς μέντοι συνέταξεν ἀποφέρειν καὶ τούτους .
he did, however, require even these nations to pay tribute.


8.6.9
4758
ὡς δὲ τότε Κῦρος κατεστήσατο , οὕτως ἔτι καὶ νῦν βασιλέως εἰσὶν αἱ ἐν ταῖς ἄκραις φυλακαὶ καὶ οἱ χιλίαρχοι τῶν φυλακῶν ἐκ βασιλέως εἰσὶ καθεστηκότες καὶ παρὰ βασιλεῖ ἀπογεγραμμένοι .
As Cyrus  then organized the service, so is it even to this day: the garrisons upon the citadels are immediately under the king’s control, and the colonels in command of the garrisons receive their appointment from the king and are enrolled upon the king’s list.


8.6.10
4759
προεῖπε δὲ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐκπεμπομένοις σατράπαις , ὅσα αὐτὸν ἑώρων ποιοῦντα , πάντα μιμεῖσθαι ·
And he gave orders to all the satraps he sent out to imitate him in everything that they saw him do:


8.6.10
4760
πρῶτον μὲν ἱππέας καθιστάναι ἐκ τῶν συνεπισπομένων Περσῶν καὶ συμμάχων καὶ ἁρματηλάτας ·
they were, in the first place, to organize companies of cavalry and charioteers from the Persians who went with them and from the allies;


8.6.10
4761
ὁπόσοι δ’ ἂν γῆν καὶ ἀρχεῖα λάβωσιν , ἀναγκάζειν τούτους ἐπὶ θύρας ἰέναι καὶ σωφροσύνης ἐπιμελουμένους παρέχειν ἑαυτοὺς τῷ σατράπῃ χρῆσθαι , ἤν τι δέηται ·
to require as many as received lands and palaces to attend at the satrap’s court and exercising proper self-restraint to put themselves at his disposal in whatever he demanded;


8.6.10
4762
παιδεύειν δὲ καὶ τοὺς γιγνομένους παῖδας ἐπὶ θύραις , ὥσπερ παρ’ αὐτῷ ·
to have the boys that were born to them educated at the local court, just as was done at the royal court;


8.6.10
4763
ἐξάγειν δ’ ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν τὸν σατράπην τοὺς ἀπὸ θυρῶν καὶ ἀσκεῖν αὑτόν τε καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὑτῷ τὰ πολεμικά .
and to take the retinue at his gates out hunting and to exercise himself and them in the arts of war.


8.6.11
4764
ὃς δ’ ἂν ἐμοί , ἔφη , κατὰ λόγον τῆς δυνάμεως πλεῖστα μὲν ἅρματα , πλείστους δὲ καὶ ἀρίστους ἱππέας ἀποδεικνύῃ , τοῦτον ἐγὼ ὡς ἀγαθὸν σύμμαχον καὶ ὡς ἀγαθὸν συμφύλακα Πέρσαις τε καὶ ἐμοὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς τιμήσω .
And whoever I find has the largest number of chariots to show and the largest number of the most efficient horsemen in proportion to his power, Cyrus added, him will I honour as a valuable ally and as a valuable fellow-protector of the sovereignty of the Persians and myself.


8.6.11
4765
ἔστων δὲ παρ’ ὑμῖν καὶ ἕδραις ὥσπερ παρ’ ἐμοὶ οἱ ἄριστοι προτετιμημένοι , καὶ τράπεζα , ὥσπερ ἡ ἐμή , τρέφουσα μὲν πρῶτον τοὺς οἰκέτας , ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ ὡς φίλοις μεταδιδόναι ἱκανῶς κεκοσμημένη καὶ ὡς τὸν καλόν τι ποιοῦντα καθ’ ἡμέραν ἐπιγεραίρειν .
And with you also, just as with me, let the most deserving be set in the most honourable seats; and let your table, like mine, feed first your own household and then, too, be bountifully arrayed so as to give a share to your friends and to confer some distinction day by day upon any one who does some noble act.


8.6.12
4766
κτᾶσθε δὲ καὶ παραδείσους καὶ θηρία τρέφετε , καὶ μήτε αὐτοί ποτε ἄνευ πόνου σῖτον παραθῆσθε μήτε ἵπποις ἀγυμνάστοις χόρτον ἐμβάλλετε ·
Have parks, too, and keep wild animals in them; and do not have your food served you unless you have first taken exercise, nor have fodder given to your horses unless they have been exercised.


8.6.12
4767
οὐ γὰρ ἂν δυναίμην ἐγὼ εἷς ὢν ἀνθρωπίνῃ ἀρετῇ τὰ πάντων ὑμῶν ἀγαθὰ διασῴζειν , ἀλλὰ δεῖ ἐμὲ μὲν ἀγαθὸν ὄντα σὺν ἀγαθοῖς τοῖς παρ’ ἐμοῦ ὑμῖν ἐπίκουρον εἶναι , ὑμᾶς δὲ ὁμοίως αὐτοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ὄντας σὺν ἀγαθοῖς τοῖς μεθ’ ὑμῶν ἐμοὶ συμμάχους εἶναι .
For I should not be able with merely human strength single-handed to ensure the permanence of the fortunes of all of you; but as I must be valiant and have those about me valiant, in order to help you; so you likewise must be valiant yourselves and have those about you valiant, in order to be my allies.


8.6.13
4768
βουλοίμην δ’ ἂν ὑμᾶς καὶ τοῦτο κατανοῆσαι ὅτι τούτων ὧν νῦν ὑμῖν παρακελεύομαι οὐδὲν τοῖς δούλοις προστάττω ·
Please observe also that among all the directions I am now giving you, I give no orders to slaves.


8.6.13
4769
ἃ δ’ ὑμᾶς φημι χρῆναι ποιεῖν , ταῦτα καὶ αὐτὸς πειρῶμαι πάντα πράττειν .
I try to do myself everything that I say you ought to do.


8.6.13
4770
ὥσπερ δ’ ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς κελεύω ἐμὲ μιμεῖσθαι , οὕτω καὶ ὑμεῖς τοὺς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἀρχὰς ἔχοντας μιμεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς διδάσκετε .
And even as I bid you follow my example, so do you also instruct those whom you appoint to office to follow yours.


8.6.14
4771
ταῦτα δὲ Κύρου οὕτω τότε τάξαντος ἔτι καὶ νῦν τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ πᾶσαι μὲν αἱ ὑπὸ βασιλεῖ φυλακαὶ ὁμοίως φυλάττονται , πᾶσαι δὲ αἱ τῶν ἀρχόντων θύραι ὁμοίως θεραπεύονται , πάντες δὲ οἱ οἶκοι καὶ μεγάλοι καὶ μικροὶ ὁμοίως οἰκοῦνται , πᾶσι δὲ οἱ ἄριστοι τῶν παρόντων ἕδραις προτετίμηνται , πᾶσαι δὲ αἱ πορεῖαι συντεταγμέναι κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον εἰσί , πᾶσαι δὲ συγκεφαλαιοῦνται πολιτικαὶ πράξεις εἰς ὀλίγους ἐπιστάτας .
And as Cyrus  then effected his organization, even so unto this day all the garrisons under the king are kept up, and all the courts of the governors are attended with service in the same way; so all households, great and small, are managed; and by all men in authority the most deserving of their guests are given preference with seats of honour; all the official journeying are conducted on the same plan and all the political business is centralized in a few heads of departments.


8.6.15
4772
ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὡς χρὴ ποιεῖν ἑκάστους καὶ δύναμιν ἑκάστῳ προσθεὶς ἐξέπεμπε , καὶ προεῖπεν ἅπασι παρασκευάζεσθαι ὡς εἰς νέωτα στρατείας ἐσομένης καὶ ἀποδείξεως ἀνδρῶν καὶ ὅπλων καὶ ἵππων καὶ ἁρμάτων .
When he had told them how they should proceed to carry out his instructions, he gave each one a force of soldiers and sent them off; and he directed them all to make preparations, with the expectation that there would be an expedition the next year and a review of the men, arms, horses, and chariots.


8.6.16
4773
κατενοήσαμεν δὲ καὶ τοῦτο ὅτι Κύρου κατάρξαντος , ὥς φασι , καὶ νῦν ἔτι διαμένει ·
We have noticed also that this regulation is still in force, whether it was instituted by Cyrus, as they affirm, or not:


8.6.16
4774
ἐφοδεύει γὰρ ἀνὴρ κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἀεὶ στράτευμα ἔχων , ὡς ἢν μέν τις τῶν σατραπῶν ἐπικουρίας δέηται , ἐπικουρῇ , ἢν δέ τις ὑβρίζῃ , σωφρονίζῃ , ἢν δέ τις ἢ δασμῶν φορᾶς ἀμελῇ ἢ τῶν ἐνοίκων φυλακῆς ἢ ὅπως ἡ χώρα ἐνεργὸς ᾖ ἢ ἄλλο τι τῶν τεταγμένων παραλίπῃ , ταῦτα πάντα κατευτρεπίζῃ ·
year by year a man makes the circuit of the provinces with an army, to help any satrap that may need help, to humble any one that may be growing rebellious, and to adjust matters if any one is careless about seeing the taxes paid or protecting the inhabitants, or to see that the land is kept under cultivation, or if any one is neglectful of anything else that he has been ordered to attend to;


8.6.16
4775
ἢν δὲ μὴ δύνηται , βασιλεῖ ἀπαγγέλλῃ ·
but if he cannot set it right, it is his business to report it to the king,


8.6.16
4776
ὁ δὲ ἀκούων βουλεύεται περὶ τοῦ ἀτακτοῦντος .
and he, when he hears of it, takes measures in regard to the offender.


8.6.16
4777
καὶ οἱ πολλάκις λεγόμενοι ὅτι βασιλέως υἱὸς καταβαίνει , βασιλέως ἀδελφός , βασιλέως ὀφθαλμός , καὶ ἐνίοτε οὐκ ἐκφαινόμενοι , οὗτοι τῶν ἐφόδων εἰσίν ·
And those of whom the report often goes out that the king’s son is coming, or the king’s brother or the king’s eye, these belong to the circuit commissioners;


8.6.16
4778
ἀποτρέπεται γὰρ ἕκαστος αὐτῶν ὁπόθεν ἂν βασιλεὺς κελεύῃ .
though sometimes they do not put in an appearance at all, for each of them turns back, wherever he may be, when the king commands.


8.6.17
4779
κατεμάθομεν δὲ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἄλλο μηχάνημα πρὸς τὸ μέγεθος τῆς ἀρχῆς , ἐξ οὗ ταχέως ᾐσθάνετο καὶ τὰ πάμπολυ ἀπέχοντα ὅπως ἔχοι .
We have observed still another device of Cyrus to cope with the magnitude of his empire; by means of this institution he would speedily discover the condition of affairs, no matter how far distant they might be from him:


8.6.17
4780
σκεψάμενος γὰρ πόσην ἂν ὁδὸν ἵππος καθανύτοι τῆς ἡμέρας ἐλαυνόμενος ὥστε διαρκεῖν , ἐποιήσατο ἱππῶνας τοσοῦτον διαλείποντας καὶ ἵππους ἐν αὐτοῖς κατέστησε καὶ τοὺς ἐπιμελομένους τούτων , καὶ ἄνδρα ἐφ’ ἑκάστῳ τῶν τόπων ἔταξε τὸν ἐπιτήδειον παραδέχεσθαι τὰ φερόμενα γράμματα καὶ παραδιδόναι καὶ παραλαμβάνειν τοὺς ἀπειρηκότας ἵππους καὶ ἀνθρώπους καὶ ἄλλους πέμπειν νεαλεῖς ·
he experimented to find out how great a distance a horse could cover in a day when ridden hard but so as not to break down, and then he erected post-stations at just such distances and equipped them with horses and men to take care of them; at each one of the stations he had the proper official appointed to receive the letters that were delivered and to forward them on, to take in the exhausted horses and riders and send on fresh ones.


8.6.18
4781
ἔστι δ’ ὅτε οὐδὲ τὰς νύκτας φασὶν ἵστασθαι ταύτην τὴν πορείαν , ἀλλὰ τῷ ἡμερινῷ ἀγγέλῳ τὸν νυκτερινὸν διαδέχεσθαι .
They say, moreover, that sometimes this express does not stop all night, but the night-messengers succeed the day-messengers in relays,


8.6.18
4782
τούτων δὲ οὕτω γιγνομένων φασί τινες θᾶττον τῶν γεράνων ταύτην τὴν πορείαν ἁνύτειν ·
and when that is the case, this express, some say, gets over the ground faster than the cranes.


8.6.18
4783
εἰ δὲ τοῦτο ψεύδονται , ἀλλ’ ὅτι γε τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων πεζῇ πορειῶν αὕτη ταχίστη , τοῦτο εὔδηλον .
If their story is not literally true, it is at all events undeniable that this is the fastest overland travelling on earth;


8.6.18
4784
ἀγαθὸν δὲ ὡς τάχιστα ἕκαστον αἰσθανόμενον ὡς τάχιστα ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
and it is a fine thing to have immediate intelligence of everything, in order to attend to it as quickly as possible.


8.6.19
4785
ἐπεὶ δὲ περιῆλθεν ὁ ἐνιαυτός , συνήγειρε στρατιὰν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα , καὶ λέγεται αὐτῷ γενέσθαι εἰς δώδεκα μὲν ἱππέων μυριάδας , εἰς δισχίλια δὲ ἅρματα δρεπανηφόρα , πεζῶν δὲ εἰς μυριάδας ἑξήκοντα .
Now, when the year had gone round, he collected his army together at Babylon , containing, it is said, about one hundred and twenty thousand horse, about two thousand scythe-bearing chariots and about six hundred thousand foot.


8.6.20
4786
ἐπεὶ δὲ ταῦτα συνεσκεύαστο αὐτῷ , ὥρμα δὴ ταύτην τὴν στρατείαν ἐν ᾗ λέγεται καταστρέψασθαι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὅσα Συρίαν ἐκβάντι οἰκεῖ μέχρι Ἐρυθρᾶς θαλάττης .
And when these had been made ready for him, he started out on that expedition on which he is said to have subjugated all the nations that fill the earth from where one leaves Syria even to the Indian Ocean.


8.6.20
4787
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἡ εἰς Αἴγυπτον στρατεία λέγεται γενέσθαι καὶ καταστρέψασθαι Αἴγυπτον .
His next expedition is said to have gone to Egypt and to have subjugated that country also.


8.6.21
4788
καὶ ἐκ τούτου τὴν ἀρχὴν ὥριζεν αὐτῷ πρὸς ἕω μὲν ἡ Ἐρυθρὰ θάλαττα , πρὸς ἄρκτον δὲ ὁ Εὔξεινος πόντος , πρὸς ἑσπέραν δὲ Κύπρος καὶ Αἴγυπτος , πρὸς μεσημβρίαν δὲ Αἰθιοπία .
From that time on his empire was bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean, on the north by the Black Sea, on the west by Cyprus and Egypt, and on the south by Ethiopia.


8.6.21
4789
τούτων δὲ τὰ πέρατα τὰ μὲν διὰ θάλπος , τὰ δὲ διὰ ψῦχος , τὰ δὲ διὰ ὕδωρ , τὰ δὲ δι’ ἀνυδρίαν δυσοίκητα .
The extremes of his empire are uninhabitable, on the one side because of the heat, on another because of the cold, on another because of too much water, and on the fourth because of too little.


8.6.22
4790
αὐτὸς δ’ ἐν μέσῳ τούτων τὴν δίαιταν ποιησάμενος , τὸν μὲν ἀμφὶ τὸν χειμῶνα χρόνον διῆγεν ἐν Βαβυλῶνι ἑπτὰ μῆνας ·
Cyrus himself made his home in the centre of his domain, and in the winter season he spent seven months in Babylon,


8.6.22
4791
αὕτη γὰρ ἀλεεινὴ ἡ χώρα ·
for there the climate is warm;


8.6.22
4792
τὸν δὲ ἀμφὶ τὸ ἔαρ τρεῖς μῆνας ἐν Σούσοις ·
in the spring he spent three months in Susa,


8.6.22
4793
τὴν δὲ ἀκμὴν τοῦ θέρους δύο μῆνας ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις ·
and in the height of summer two months in Ecbatana.


8.6.22
4794
οὕτω δὴ ποιοῦντ’ αὐτὸν λέγουσιν ἐν ἐαρινῷ θάλπει καὶ ψύχει διάγειν ἀεί .
By so doing, they say, he enjoyed the warmth and coolness of perpetual spring-time.


8.6.23
4795
οὕτω δὲ διέκειντο πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνθρωποι ὡς πᾶν μὲν ἔθνος μειονεκτεῖν ἐδόκει , εἰ μὴ Κύρῳ πέμψειεν ὅ τι καλὸν αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ἢ φύοιτο ἢ τρέφοιτο ἢ τεχνῷτο , πᾶσα δὲ πόλις ὡσαύτως , πᾶς δὲ ἰδιώτης πλούσιος ἂν ᾤετο γενέσθαι , εἴ τι Κύρῳ χαρίσαιτο ·
People, moreover, were so devoted to him that those of every nation thought they did themselves an injury if they did not send to Cyrus the most valuable productions of their country, whether the fruits of the earth, or animals bred there, or manufactures of their own arts; and every city did the same.


8.6.23
4796
καὶ γὰρ ὁ Κῦρος λαμβάνων παρ’ ἑκάστων ὧν ἀφθονίαν εἶχον οἱ διδόντες ἀντεδίδου ὧν σπανίζοντας αὐτοὺς αἰσθάνοιτο .
And every private individual thought he should become a rich man if he should do something to please Cyrus. And his theory was correct; for Cyrus would always accept that of which the givers had an abundance, and he would give in return that of which he saw that they were in want.


8.7.1
4797
οὕτω δὲ τοῦ αἰῶνος προκεχωρηκότος , μάλα δὴ πρεσβύτης ὢν ὁ Κῦρος ἀφικνεῖται εἰς Πέρσας τὸ ἕβδομον ἐπὶ τῆς αὑτοῦ ἀρχῆς .
When his life was far spent amid such achievements and Cyrus was now a very old man, he came back for the seventh time in his reign to Persia.


8.7.1
4798
καὶ ὁ μὲν πατὴρ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ πάλαι δὴ ὥσπερ εἰκὸς ἐτετελευτήκεσαν αὐτῷ ·
His father and his mother were in the course of nature long since dead;


8.7.1
4799
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ἔθυσε τὰ νομιζόμενα ἱερὰ καὶ τοῦ χοροῦ ἡγήσατο Πέρσαις κατὰ τὰ πάτρια καὶ τὰ δῶρα πᾶσι διέδωκεν ὥσπερ εἰώθει .
so Cyrus performed the customary sacrifice and led the Persians in their national dance and distributed presents among them all, as had been his custom.


8.7.2
4800
κοιμηθεὶς δ’ ἐν τῷ βασιλείῳ ὄναρ εἶδε τοιόνδε .
As he slept in the palace, he saw a vision:


8.7.2
4801
ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ προσελθὼν κρείττων τις ἢ κατὰ ἄνθρωπον εἰπεῖν ·
a figure of more than human majesty appeared to him in a dream and said:


8.7.2
4802
συσκευάζου , ὦ Κῦρε ·
Make ready, Cyrus;


8.7.2
4803
ἤδη γὰρ εἰς θεοὺς ἄπει .
for thou shalt soon depart to the gods.


8.7.2
4804
τοῦτο δὲ ἰδὼν τὸ ὄναρ ἐξηγέρθη καὶ σχεδὸν ἐδόκει εἰδέναι ὅτι τοῦ βίου ἡ τελευτὴ παρείη .
When the vision was past, he awoke and seemed almost to know that the end of his life was at hand.


8.7.3
4805
εὐθὺς οὖν λαβὼν ἱερεῖα ἔθυε Διί τε πατρῴῳ καὶ Ἡλίῳ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις θεοῖς ἐπὶ τῶν ἄκρων , ὡς Πέρσαι θύουσιν , ὧδ’ ἐπευχόμενος ·
Accordingly, he at once took victims and offered sacrifice in the high places to ancestral Zeus, to Helius, and to the rest of the gods, even as the Persians are wont to make sacrifice;


8.7.3
4806
Ζεῦ πατρῷε καὶ Ἥλιε καὶ πάντες θεοί , δέχεσθε τάδε καὶ τελεστήρια πολλῶν καὶ καλῶν πράξεων καὶ χαριστήρια ὅτι ἐσημαίνετέ μοι καὶ ἐν ἱεροῖς καὶ ἐν οὐρανίοις σημείοις καὶ ἐν οἰωνοῖς καὶ ἐν φήμαις ἅ τ’ ἐχρῆν ποιεῖν καὶ ἃ οὐκ ἐχρῆν .
and as he sacrificed, he prayed, saying: O ancestral Zeus and Helius and all the gods, accept these offerings as tokens of gratitude for help in achieving many glorious enterprises; for in omens in the sacrifice, in signs from heaven, in the flight of birds, and in ominous words, ye ever showed me what I ought to do and what I ought not to do.


8.7.3
4807
πολλὴ δ’ ὑμῖν χάρις ὅτι κ- ἐγὼ ἐγίγνωσκον τὴν ὑμετέραν ἐπιμέλειαν καὶ οὐδεπώποτε ἐπὶ ταῖς εὐτυχίαις ὑπὲρ ἄνθρωπον ἐφρόνησα .
And I render heartfelt thanks to you that I have never failed to recognize your fostering care and never in my successes entertained proud thoughts transcending human bounds.


8.7.3
4808
αἰτοῦμαι δ’ ὑμᾶς δοῦναι καὶ νῦν παισὶ μὲν καὶ γυναικὶ καὶ φίλοις καὶ πατρίδι εὐδαιμονίαν , ἐμοὶ δὲ οἷόνπερ αἰῶνα δεδώκατε , τοιαύτην καὶ τελευτὴν δοῦναι .
And I beseech of you that ye will now also grant prosperity and happiness to my children, my wife, my friends, and my country, and to me myself an end befitting the life that ye have given me.


8.7.4
4809
ὁ μὲν δὴ τοιαῦτα ποιήσας καὶ οἴκαδε ἐλθὼν ἔδοξεν ἡδέως ἀναπαύσεσθαι καὶ κατεκλίνη .
Then after he had concluded his rites and come home, he thought he would be glad to rest and so lay down;


8.7.4
4810
ἐπεὶ δὲ ὥρα ἦν , οἱ τεταγμένοι προσιόντες λούσασθαι αὐτὸν ἐκέλευον .
and when the hour came, those whose office it was came in and bade him go to his bath.


8.7.4
4811
ὁ δ’ ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἡδέως ἀναπαύοιτο .
But he told them that he was resting happily.


8.7.4
4812
οἱ δ’ αὖ τεταγμένοι , ἐπεὶ ὥρα ἦν , δεῖπνον παρετίθεσαν ·
And then again, when the hour came, those whose office it was set dinner before him.


8.7.4
4813
τῷ δὲ ἡ ψυχὴ σῖτον μὲν οὐ προσίετο , διψῆν δ’ ἐδόκει , καὶ ἔπιεν ἡδέως .
But his soul had no desire for food, but he seemed thirsty and drank with pleasure.


8.7.5
4814
ὡς δὲ καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ συνέβαινεν αὐτῷ τ- αὐτὰ καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ , ἐκάλεσε τοὺς παῖδας ·
And when the same thing befell him on the next day and the day after that, he summoned his sons;


8.7.5
4815
οἱ δ’ ἔτυχον συνηκολουθηκότες αὐτῷ καὶ ὄντες ἐν Πέρσαις ·
for they had accompanied him, as it chanced, and were still in Persia.


8.7.5
4816
ἐκάλεσε δὲ καὶ τοὺς φίλους καὶ τὰς Περσῶν ἀρχάς ·
He summoned also his friends and the Persian magistrates;


8.7.5
4817
παρόντων δὲ πάντων ἤρχετο τοιοῦδε λόγου .
and when they were all come, he began to speak as follows:


8.7.6
4818
παῖδες ἐμοὶ καὶ πάντες οἱ παρόντες φίλοι , ἐμοὶ μὲν τοῦ βίου τὸ τέλος ἤδη πάρεστιν ·
My sons, and all you my friends about me, the end of my life is now at hand;


8.7.6
4819
ἐκ πολλῶν τοῦτο σαφῶς γιγνώσκω ·
I am quite sure of this for many reasons;


8.7.6
4820
ὑμᾶς δὲ χρή , ὅταν τελευτήσω , ὡς περὶ εὐδαίμονος ἐμοῦ καὶ λέγειν καὶ ποιεῖν πάντα .
and when I am dead, you must always speak and act in regard to me as of one blessed of fortune.


8.7.6
4821
ἐγὼ γὰρ παῖς τε ὢν τὰ ἐν παισὶ νομιζόμενα καλὰ δοκῶ κεκαρπῶσθαι , ἐπεί τε ἥβησα , τὰ ἐν νεανίσκοις , τέλειός τε ἀνὴρ γενόμενος τὰ ἐν ἀνδράσι ·
For when I was a boy, I think I plucked all the fruits that among boys count for the best; when I became a youth, I enjoyed what is accounted best among young men; and when I became a mature man, I had the best that men can have.


8.7.6
4822
σὺν τῷ χρόνῳ τε προϊόντι ἀεὶ συναυξανομένην ἐπιγιγνώσκειν ἐδόκουν καὶ τὴν ἐμὴν δύναμιν , ὥστε καὶ τ- ἐμὸν γῆρας οὐδεπώποτε ᾐσθόμην τῆς ἐμῆς νεότητος ἀσθενέστερον γιγνόμενον , καὶ οὔτ’ ἐπιχειρήσας οὔτ’ ἐπιθυμήσας οἶδα ὅτου ἠτύχησα .
And as time went on, it seemed to me that I recognized that my own strength was always increasing with my years, so that I never found my old age growing any more feeble than my youth had been; and, so far as I know, there is nothing that I ever attempted or desired and yet failed to secure.


8.7.7
4823
καὶ τοὺς μὲν φίλους ἐπεῖδον δι’ ἐμοῦ εὐδαίμονας γενομένους , τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ δουλωθέντας ·
Moreover, I have lived to see my friends made prosperous and happy through my efforts and my enemies reduced by me to subjection;


8.7.7
4824
καὶ τὴν πατρίδα πρόσθεν ἰδιωτεύουσαν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ νῦν προτετιμημένην καταλείπω ·
and my country, which once played no great part in Asia, I now leave honoured above all.


8.7.7
4825
ὧν τ’ ἐκτησάμην οὐδὲν οἶδα ὅ τι οὐ διεσωσάμην .
Of all my conquests, there is not once that I have not maintained.


8.7.7
4826
καὶ τὸν μὲν παρελθόντα χρόνον ἔπραττον οὕτως ὥσπερ ηὐχόμην ·
Throughout the past I have fared even as I have wished;


8.7.7
4827
φόβος δέ μοι συμπαρομαρτῶν μή τι ἐν τῷ ἐπιόντι χρόνῳ ἢ ἴδοιμι ἢ ἀκούσαιμι ἢ πάθοιμι χαλεπόν , οὐκ εἴα τελέως με μέγα φρονεῖν οὐδ’ εὐφραίνεσθαι ἐκπεπταμένως .
but a fear that was ever at my side, lest in the time to come I might see or hear or experience something unpleasant, would not let me become overweeningly proud or extravagantly happy.


8.7.8
4828
νῦν δ’ ἢν τελευτήσω , καταλείπω μὲν ὑμᾶς , ὦ παῖδες , ζῶντας οὕσπερ ἔδοσάν μοι οἱ θεοὶ γενέσθαι ·
But now, if I die, I leave you, my sons, whom the gods have given me, to survive me,


8.7.8
4829
καταλείπω δὲ πατρίδα καὶ φίλους εὐδαιμονοῦντας ·
and I leave my friends and country happy;


8.7.9
4830
ὥστε πῶς οὐκ ἂν ἐγὼ δικαίως μακαριζόμενος τὸν ἀεὶ χρόνον μνήμης τυγχάνοιμι ;
and so why should I not be justly accounted blessed and enjoy an immortality of fame?


8.7.9
4831
δεῖ δὲ καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν με ἤδη σαφηνίσαντα καταλιπεῖν , ὡς ἂν μὴ ἀμφίλογος γενομένη πράγματα ὑμῖν παράσχῃ .
But I must also declare my will about the disposition of my throne, that the succession may not become a matter of dispute and cause you trouble.


8.7.9
4832
ἐγὼ δ’ οὖν φιλῶ μὲν ἀμφοτέρους ὑμᾶς ὁμοίως , ὦ παῖδες ·
Now, I love you both alike, my sons;


8.7.9
4833
τὸ δὲ προβουλεύειν καὶ τὸ ἡγεῖσθαι ἐφ’ ὅ τι ἂν καιρὸς δοκῇ εἶναι , τοῦτο προστάττω τῷ προτέρῳ γενομένῳ καὶ πλειόνων κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἐμπείρῳ .
but precedence in counsel and leadership in everything that may be thought expedient, that I commit to the first born, who naturally has a wider experience.


8.7.10
4834
ἐπαιδεύθην δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς οὕτως ὑπὸ τῆσδε τῆς ἐμῆς τε καὶ ὑμετέρας πατρίδος , τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις οὐ μόνον ἀδελφοῖς ἀλλὰ καὶ πολίταις καὶ ὁδῶν καὶ θάκων καὶ λόγων ὑπείκειν , καὶ ὑμᾶς δέ , ὦ παῖδες , οὕτως ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐπαίδευον , τοὺς μὲν γεραιτέρους προτιμᾶν , τῶν δὲ νεωτέρων προτετιμῆσθαι ·
I, too, was thus trained by my country and yours to give precedence to my elders — not merely to brothers but to all fellow-citizens — on the street, in the matter of seats, and in speaking;


8.7.10
4835
ὡς οὖν παλαιὰ καὶ εἰθισμένα καὶ ἔννομα λέγοντος ἐμοῦ οὕτως ἀποδέχεσθε .
and so from the beginning, my children, I have been training you also to honour your elders above yourselves and to be honoured above those who are younger. Take what I say, therefore, as that which is approved by time, by custom, and by the law.


8.7.11
4836
καὶ σὺ μέν , ὦ Καμβύση , τὴν βασιλείαν ἔχε , θεῶν τε διδόντων καὶ ἐμοῦ ὅσον ἐν ἐμοί ·
So you, Cambyses, shall have the throne, the gift of the gods and of myself, in so far as it is mine to give.


8.7.11
4837
σοὶ δ’ , ὦ Ταναοξάρη , σατράπην εἶναι δίδωμι Μήδων τε καὶ Ἀρμενίων καὶ τρίτων Καδουσίων ·
To you, Tanaoxares, I give the satrapy of Media, Armenia, and, in addition to those two, Cadusia.


8.7.11
4838
ταῦτα δέ σοι διδοὺς νομίζω ἀρχὴν μὲν μείζω καὶ τ- ὄνομα τῆς βασιλείας τῷ πρεσβυτέρῳ καταλιπεῖν , εὐδαιμονίαν δὲ σοὶ ἀλυποτέραν .
And in giving you this office, I consider that I leave to your older brother greater power and the title of king, while to you I leave a happiness disturbed by fewer cares;


8.7.12
4839
ὁποίας μὲν γὰρ ἀνθρωπίνης εὐφροσύνης ἐνδεὴς ἔσῃ οὐχ ὁρῶ ·
for I cannot see what human pleasure you will lack;


8.7.12
4840
ἀλλὰ πάντα σοι τὰ δοκοῦντα ἀνθρώπους εὐφραίνειν παρέσται .
on the contrary, everything that is thought to bring pleasure to man will be yours.


8.7.12
4841
τὸ δὲ δυσκαταπρακτοτέρων τε ἐρᾶν καὶ τὸ πολλὰ μεριμνᾶν καὶ τὸ μὴ δύνασθαι ἡσυχίαν ἔχειν κεντριζόμενον ὑπὸ τῆς πρὸς τ- ἐμὰ ἔργα φιλονικίας καὶ τὸ ἐπιβουλεύειν καὶ τὸ ἐπιβουλεύεσθαι , ταῦτα τῷ βασιλεύοντι ἀνάγκη σοῦ μᾶλλον συμπαρομαρτεῖν , ἃ σάφ’ ἴσθι τοῦ εὐφραίνεσθαι πολλὰς ἀσχολίας παρέχει .
But to set one’s heart on more difficult undertakings, to be cumbered with many cares, and to be able to find no rest, because spurred on by emulation of what I have done, to lay plots and to be plotted against, all that must necessarily go hand in hand with royal power more than with your station; and, let me assure you, it brings many interruptions to happiness.


8.7.13
4842
οἶσθα μὲν οὖν καὶ σύ , ὦ Καμβύση , ὅτι οὐ τόδε τὸ χρυσοῦν σκῆπτρον τὸ τὴν βασιλείαν διασῷζόν ἐστιν , ἀλλ’ οἱ πιστοὶ φίλοι σκῆπτρον βασιλεῦσιν ἀληθέστατον καὶ ἀσφαλέστατον .
As for you, Cambyses, you must also know that it is not this golden sceptre that maintains your empire; but faithful friends are a monarch’s truest and surest sceptre.


8.7.13
4843
πιστοὺς δὲ μὴ νόμιζε φύσει φύεσθαι ἀνθρώπους ·
But do not think that man is naturally faithful;


8.7.13
4844
πᾶσι γὰρ ἂν οἱ αὐτοὶ πιστοὶ φαίνοιντο , ὥσπερ καὶ τ- ἄλλα τὰ πεφυκότα πᾶσι τὰ αὐτὰ φαίνεται ·
else all men would find the same persons faithful, just as all find the other properties of nature the same.


8.7.13
4845
ἀλλὰ τοὺς πιστοὺς τίθεσθαι δεῖ ἕκαστον ἑαυτῷ ·
But every one must create for himself faithfulness in his friends;


8.7.13
4846
ἡ δὲ κτῆσις αὐτῶν ἔστιν οὐδαμῶς σὺν τῇ βίᾳ , ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον σὺν τῇ εὐεργεσίᾳ .
and the winning of such friends comes in no wise by compulsion, but by kindness.


8.7.14
4847
εἰ οὖν καὶ ἄλλους τινὰς πειράσῃ συμφύλακας τῆς βασιλείας ποιεῖσθαι μηδαμόθεν πρότερον ἄρχου ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὁμόθεν γενομένου .
If, then, you shall endeavour to make others also fellow-guardians of your sovereignty, make a beginning nowhere sooner than with him who is of the same blood with yourself.


8.7.14
4848
καὶ πολῖταί τοι ἄνθρωποι ἀλλοδαπῶν οἰκειότεροι καὶ σύσσιτοι ἀποσκήνων ·
Fellow-citizens, you know, stand nearer than foreigners do, and messmates nearer than those who eat elsewhere;


8.7.14
4849
οἱ δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτοῦ σπέρματος φύντες καὶ ὑπὸ τῆς αὐτῆς μητρὸς τραφέντες καὶ ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐξηθέντες καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν αὐτῶν γονέων ἀγαπώμενοι καὶ τὴν αὐτὴν μητέρα καὶ τὸν αὐτὸν πατέρα προσαγορεύοντες , πῶς οὐ πάντων οὗτοι οἰκειότατοι ;
but those who are sprung from the same seed, nursed by the same mother, reared in the same home, loved by the same parents, and who address the same persons as father and mother, how are they not the closest of all?


8.7.15
4850
μὴ οὖν ἃ οἱ θεοὶ ὑφήγηνται ἀγαθὰ εἰς οἰκειότητα ἀδελφοῖς μάταιά ποτε ποιήσητε , ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ ταῦτα εὐθὺς οἰκοδομεῖτε ἄλλα φιλικὰ ἔργα ·
Do not you two, therefore, ever make of no effect those blessings whereby the gods have led the way to knitting close the bonds between brothers, but do you build at once upon that foundation still other works of love;


8.7.15
4851
καὶ οὕτως ἀεὶ ἀνυπέρβλητος ἄλλοις ἔσται ἡ ὑμετέρα φιλία .
and thus the love between you will always be a love that no other men can ever surpass.


8.7.15
4852
ἑαυτοῦ τοι κήδεται ὁ προνοῶν ἀδελφοῦ ·
Surely he that has forethought for his brother is taking care for himself;


8.7.15
4853
τίνι γὰρ ἄλλῳ ἀδελφὸς μέγας ὢν οὕτω καλὸν ὡς ἀδελφῷ ;
for to whom else is a brother’s greatness more of an honour than to a brother?


8.7.15
4854
τίς δ’ ἄλλος τιμήσεται δι’ ἄνδρα μέγα δυνάμενον οὕτως ὡς ἀδελφός ;
And who else will be honoured by the power of a great man so much as that man’s brother?


8.7.15
4855
τίνα δὲ φοβήσεταί τις ἀδικεῖν ἀδελφοῦ μεγάλου ὄντος οὕτως ὡς τὸν ἀδελφόν ;
And if a man’s brother is a great man, whom will any one so much fear to injure as that man’s brother?


8.7.16
4856
μήτε οὖν θᾶττον μηδεὶς σοῦ τούτῳ ὑπακουέτω μήτε προθυμότερον παρέστω ·
Therefore, Tanaoxares, let no one more readily than yourself yield obedience to your brother or more zealously support him.


8.7.16
4857
οὐδενὶ γὰρ οἰκειότερα τὰ τούτου οὔτε ἀγαθὰ οὔτε δεινὰ ἢ σοί .
For his fortunes, good or ill, will touch no one more closely than yourself.


8.7.16
4858
ἐννόει δὲ καὶ τάδε ·
And bear this also in mind:


8.7.16
4859
τίνι χαρισάμενος ἐλπίσαις ἂν μειζόνων τυχεῖν ἢ τούτῳ ;
whom could you favour in the hope of getting more from him than from your brother?


8.7.16
4860
τίνι δ’ ἂν βοηθήσας ἰσχυρότερον σύμμαχον ἀντιλάβοις ;
Where could you lend help and get in return a surer ally than you would find in him?


8.7.16
4861
τίνα δ’ αἴσχιον μὴ φιλεῖν ἢ τὸν ἀδελφόν ;
Whom would it be a more shameful thing for you not to love than your own brother?


8.7.16
4862
τίνα δὲ ἁπάντων κάλλιον προτιμᾶν ἢ τὸν ἀδελφόν ;
And who is there in all the world whom it would be a more noble thing to prefer in honour than your brother?


8.7.16
4863
μόνου τοι , ὦ Καμβύση , πρωτεύοντος ἀδελφοῦ παρ’ ἀδελφῷ οὐδὲ φθόνος παρὰ τῶν ἄλλων ἐφικνεῖται .
It is only a brother, you know, Cambyses, whom, if he holds the first place of love in his brother’s heart, the envy of others cannot reach.


8.7.17
4864
ἀλλὰ πρὸς θεῶν πατρῴων , ὦ παῖδες , τιμᾶτε ἀλλήλους , εἴ τι καὶ τοῦ ἐμοὶ χαρίζεσθαι μέλει ὑμῖν ·
Nay by our fathers’ gods I implore you, my sons, honour one another, if you care at all to give me pleasure.


8.7.17
4865
οὐ γὰρ δήπου τοῦτό γε σαφῶς δοκεῖτε εἰδέναι ὡς οὐδὲν ἔτι ἐγὼ ἔσομαι , ἐπειδὰν τοῦ ἀνθρωπίνου βίου τελευτήσω ·
For assuredly, this one thing, so it seems to me, you do not know clearly, that I shall have no further being when I have finished this earthly life;


8.7.17
4866
οὐδὲ γὰρ νῦν τοι τήν γ’ ἐμὴν ψυχὴν ἑωρᾶτε , ἀλλ’ οἷς διεπράττετο , τούτοις αὐτὴν ὡς οὖσαν κατεφωρᾶτε .
for not even in this life have you seen my soul, but you have detected its existence by what it accomplished.


8.7.18
4867
τὰς δὲ τῶν ἄδικα παθόντων ψυχὰς οὔπω κατενοήσατε οἵους μὲν φόβους τοῖς μιαιφόνοις ἐμβάλλουσιν , οἵους δὲ παλαμναίους τοῖς ἀνοσίοις ἐπιπέμπουσι ;
Have you never yet observed what terror the souls of those who have been foully dealt with strike into the hearts of those who have shed their blood, and what avenging deities they send upon the track of the wicked?


8.7.18
4868
τοῖς δὲ φθιμένοις τὰς τιμὰς διαμένειν ἔτι ἂν δοκεῖτε , εἰ μηδενὸς αὐτῶν αἱ ψυχαὶ κύριαι ἦσαν ;
And do you think that the honours paid to the dead would continue, if their souls had no part in any of them?


8.7.19
4869
οὔτοι ἔγωγε , ὦ παῖδες , οὐδὲ τοῦτο πώποτε ἐπείσθην ὡς ἡ ψυχὴ ἕως μὲν ἂν ἐν θνητῷ σώματι ᾖ , ζῇ , ὅταν δὲ τούτου ἀπαλλαγῇ , τέθνηκεν ·
I am sure I do not; nor yet, my sons, have I ever convinced myself of this — that only as long as it is contained in a mortal body is the soul alive, but when it has been freed from it, is dead;


8.7.19
4870
ὁρῶ γὰρ ὅτι καὶ τὰ θνητὰ σώματα ὅσον ἂν ἐν αὐτοῖς χρόνον ᾖ ἡ ψυχή , ζῶντα παρέχεται .
for I see that it is the soul that endues mortal bodies with life, as long as it is in them.


8.7.20
4871
οὐδέ γε ὅπως ἄφρων ἔσται ἡ ψυχή , ἐπειδὰν τοῦ ἄφρονος σώματος δίχα γένηται , οὐδὲ τοῦτο πέπεισμαι ·
Neither have I been able to convince myself of this — that the soul will want intelligence just when it is separated from this unintelligent body;


8.7.20
4872
ἀλλ’ ὅταν ἄκρατος καὶ καθαρὸς ὁ νοῦς ἐκκριθῇ , τότε καὶ φρονιμώτατον αὐτὸν εἰκὸς εἶναι .
but when the spirit is set free, pure and untrammelled by matter, then it is likely to be most intelligent.


8.7.20
4873
διαλυομένου δὲ ἀνθρώπου δῆλά ἐστιν ἕκαστα ἀπιόντα πρὸς τὸ ὁμόφυλον πλὴν τῆς ψυχῆς ·
And when man is resolved into his primal elements, it is clear that every part returns to kindred matter, except the soul;


8.7.20
4874
αὕτη δὲ μόνη οὔτε παροῦσα οὔτε ἀπιοῦσα ὁρᾶται .
that alone cannot be seen, either when present or when departing.


8.7.21
4875
ἐννοήσατε δ’ , ἔφη , ὅτι ἐγγύτερον μὲν τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων θανάτῳ οὐδέν ἐστιν ὕπνου ·
Consider again, he continued, that there is nothing in the world more nearly akin to death than is sleep;


8.7.21
4876
ἡ δὲ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ψυχὴ τότε δήπου θειοτάτη καταφαίνεται καὶ τότε τι τῶν μελλόντων προορᾷ ·
and the soul of man at just such times is revealed in its most divine aspect and at such times, too, it looks forward into the future;


8.7.22
4877
τότε γάρ , ὡς ἔοικε , μάλιστα ἐλευθεροῦται .
for then, it seems, it is most untrammelled by the bonds of the flesh.


8.7.22
4878
εἰ μὲν οὖν οὕτως ἔχει ταῦτα ὥσπερ ἐγὼ οἴομαι καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ καταλείπει τὸ σῶμα , καὶ τὴν ἐμὴν ψυχὴν καταιδούμενοι ποιεῖτε ἃ ἐγὼ δέομαι ·
Now if this is true, as I think it is, and if the soul does leave the body, then do what I request of you and show reverence for my soul.


8.7.22
4879
εἰ δὲ μὴ οὕτως , ἀλλὰ μένουσα ἡ ψυχὴ ἐν τῷ σώματι συναποθνῄσκει , ἀλλὰ θεούς γε τοὺς ἀεὶ ὄντας καὶ πάντ’ ἐφορῶντας καὶ πάντα δυναμένους , οἳ καὶ τήνδε τὴν τῶν ὅλων τάξιν συνέχουσιν ἀτριβῆ καὶ ἀγήρατον καὶ ἀναμάρτητον καὶ ὑπὸ κάλλους καὶ μεγέθους ἀδιήγητον , τούτους φοβούμενοι μήποτ’ ἀσεβὲς μηδὲν μηδὲ ἀνόσιον μήτε ποιήσητε μήτε βουλεύσητε .
But if it is not so, and if the soul remains in the body and dies with it, then at least fear the gods, eternal, all-seeing, omnipotent, who keep this ordered universe together, unimpaired, ageless, unerring, indescribable in its beauty and its grandeur; and never allow yourselves to do or purpose anything wicked or unholy.


8.7.23
4880
μετὰ μέντοι θεοὺς καὶ ἀνθρώπων τὸ πᾶν γένος τὸ ἀεὶ ἐπιγιγνόμενον αἰδεῖσθε ·
Next to the gods, however, show respect also to all the race of men as they continue in perpetual succession;


8.7.23
4881
οὐ γὰρ ἐν σκότῳ ὑμᾶς οἱ θεοὶ ἀποκρύπτονται , ἀλλ’ ἐμφανῆ πᾶσιν ἀνάγκη ἀεὶ ζῆν τὰ ὑμέτερα ἔργα ·
for the gods, do not hide you away in darkness, but your works must ever live on in the sight of all men;


8.7.23
4882
ἃ ἢν μὲν καθαρὰ καὶ ἔξω τῶν ἀδίκων φαίνηται , δυνατοὺς ὑμᾶς ἐν πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἀναδείξει ·
and if they are pure and untainted with unrighteousness, they will make your power manifest among all mankind.


8.7.23
4883
εἰ δὲ εἰς ἀλλήλους ἄδικόν τι φρονήσετε , ἐκ πάντων ἀνθρώπων τὸ ἀξιόπιστοι εἶναι ἀποβαλεῖτε .
But if you conceive any unrighteous schemes against each other, you will forfeit in the eyes of all men your right to be trusted.


8.7.23
4884
οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἂν ἔτι πιστεῦσαι δύναιτο ὑμῖν , οὐδ’ εἰ πάνυ προθυμοῖτο , ἰδὼν ἀδικούμενον τὸν μάλιστα φιλίᾳ προσήκοντα .
For no one would be able any longer to trust you — not even if he very much desired to do so — if he saw either of you wronging that one who has the first claim to the other’s love.


8.7.24
4885
εἰ μὲν οὖν ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς ἱκανῶς διδάσκω οἵους χρὴ πρὸς ἀλλήλους εἶναι ·
Now, if I am giving you sufficient instructions as to what manner of men you ought to be one towards the other — well and good;


8.7.24
4886
εἰ δὲ μή , καὶ παρὰ τῶν προγεγενημένων μανθάνετε ·
if not, then you must learn it from the history of the past,


8.7.24
4887
αὕτη γὰρ ἀρίστη διδασκαλία .
for this is the best source of instruction.


8.7.24
4888
οἱ μὲν γὰρ πολλοὶ διαγεγένηνται φίλοι μὲν γονεῖς παισί , φίλοι δὲ ἀδελφοὶ ἀδελφοῖς ·
For, as a rule, parents have always been friends to their children, brothers to their brothers;


8.7.24
4889
ἤδη δέ τινες τούτων καὶ ἐναντία ἀλλήλοις ἔπραξαν ·
but ere now some of them have been at enmity one with another.


8.7.24
4890
ὁποτέροις ἂν οὖν αἰσθάνησθε τὰ πραχθέντα συνενεγκόντα , ταῦτα δὴ αἱρούμενοι ὀρθῶς ἂν βουλεύοισθε .
Whichever, therefore, of these two courses you shall find to have been profitable, choose that, and you would counsel well.


8.7.25
4891
καὶ τούτων μὲν ἴσως ἤδη ἅλις .
But of this, perhaps, enough.


8.7.25
4892
τὸ δ’ ἐμὸν σῶμα , ὦ παῖδες , ὅταν τελευτήσω , μήτε ἐν χρυσῷ θῆτε μήτε ἐν ἀργύρῳ μηδὲ ἐν ἄλλῳ μηδενί , ἀλλὰ τῇ γῇ ὡς τάχιστα ἀπόδοτε .
Now as to my body, when I am dead, my sons, lay it away neither in gold nor in silver nor in anything else, but commit it to the earth as soon as may be.


8.7.25
4893
τί γὰρ τούτου μακαριώτερον τοῦ γῇ μειχθῆναι , ἣ πάντα μὲν τὰ καλά , πάντα δὲ τ- ἀγαθὰ φύει τε καὶ τρέφει ;
For what is more blessed than to be united with the earth, which brings forth and nourishes all things beautiful and all things good?


8.7.25
4894
ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ ἄλλως φιλάνθρωπος ἐγενόμην καὶ νῦν ἡδέως ἄν μοι δοκῶ κοινωνῆσαι τοῦ εὐεργετοῦντος ἀνθρώπους .
I have always been a friend to man, and I think I should gladly now become a part of that which does him so much good.


8.7.26
4895
ἀλλὰ γὰρ ἤδη , ἔφη , ἐκλείπειν μοι φαίνεται ἡ ψυχὴ ὅθενπερ , ὡς ἔοικε , πᾶσιν ἄρχεται ἀπολείπουσα .
But I must conclude, he said; for my soul seems to me to be slipping away from those parts of my body, from which, as it appears, it is wont to begin its departure.


8.7.26
4896
εἴ τις οὖν ὑμῶν ἢ δεξιᾶς βούλεται τῆς ἐμῆς ἅψασθαι ἢ ὄμμα τ- ἐμὸν ζῶντος ἔτι προσιδεῖν ἐθέλει , προσίτω ·
So if any one wishes to take my hand or desires to look into my face while I yet live, let him come near;


8.7.26
4897
ὅταν δ’ ἐγὼ ἐγκαλύψωμαι , αἰτοῦμαι ὑμᾶς , ὦ παῖδες , μηδεὶς ἔτ’ ἀνθρώπων τ- ἐμὸν σῶμα ἰδέτω , μηδ’ αὐτοὶ ὑμεῖς .
but after I have covered myself over, I beg of you, my children, let no one look upon my body, not even yourselves.


8.7.27
4898
Πέρσας μέντοι πάντας καὶ τοὺς συμμάχους ἐπὶ τὸ μνῆμα τ- ἐμὸν παρακαλεῖτε συνησθησομένους ἐμοὶ ὅτι ἐν τῷ ἀσφαλεῖ ἤδη ἔσομαι , ὡς μηδὲν ἂν ἔτι κακὸν παθεῖν , μήτε ἢν μετὰ τοῦ θείου γένωμαι μήτε ἢν μηδὲν ἔτι ὦ ·
Invite, however, all the Persians and our allies to my burial, to joy with me in that I shall henceforth be in security such that no evil can ever again come nigh me, whether I shall be in the divine presence or whether I shall no longer have any being;


8.7.27
4899
ὁπόσοι δ’ ἂν ἔλθωσι , τούτους εὖ ποιήσαντες ὁπόσα ἐπ’ ἀνδρὶ εὐδαίμονι νομίζεται ἀποπέμπετε .
and to all those who come show all the courtesies that are usual in honour of a man that has been blessed of fortune, and then dismiss them.


8.7.28
4900
καὶ τοῦτο , ἔφη , μέμνησθέ μου τελευταῖον , τοὺς φίλους εὐεργετοῦντες καὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς δυνήσεσθε κολάζειν .
Remember also this last word of mine, he said: if you do good to your friends, you will also be able to punish your enemies.


8.7.28
4901
καὶ χαίρετε , ὦ φίλοι παῖδες , καὶ τῇ μητρὶ ἀπαγγέλλετε ὡς παρ’ ἐμοῦ ·
And now farewell, my children, and say farewell to your mother as from me.


8.7.28
4902
καὶ πάντες δὲ οἱ παρόντες καὶ οἱ ἀπόντες φίλοι χαίρετε .
And to all my friends, both present and absent, I bid farewell.


8.7.28
4903
ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν καὶ πάντας δεξιωσάμενος ἐνεκαλύψατο καὶ οὕτως ἐτελεύτησεν .
After these words, he shook hands with them all, covered himself over, and so died.


8.8.1
4904
ὅτι μὲν δὴ καλλίστη καὶ μεγίστη τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ ἡ Κύρου βασιλεία ἐγένετο αὐτὴ ἑαυτῇ μαρτυρεῖ .
That Cyrus’s empire was the greatest and most glorious of all the kingdoms in Asia — of that it may be its own witness.


8.8.1
4905
ὡρίσθη γὰρ πρὸς ἕω μὲν τῇ Ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάττῃ , πρὸς ἄρκτον δὲ τῷ Εὐξείνῳ πόντῳ , πρὸς ἑσπέραν δὲ Κύπρῳ καὶ Αἰγύπτῳ , πρὸς μεσημβρίαν δὲ Αἰθιοπίᾳ .
For it was bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean, on the north by the Black Sea, on the west by Cyprus and Egypt, and on the south by Ethiopia.


8.8.1
4906
τοσαύτη δὲ γενομένη μιᾷ γνώμῃ τῇ Κύρου ἐκυβερνᾶτο , καὶ ἐκεῖνός τε τοὺς ὑφ’ ἑαυτῷ ὥσπερ ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας ἐτίμα τε καὶ ἐθεράπευεν , οἵ τε ἀρχόμενοι Κῦρον ὡς πατέρα ἐσέβοντο .
And although it was of such magnitude, it was governed by the single will of Cyrus; and he honoured his subjects and cared for them as if they were his own children; and they, on their part, reverenced Cyrus as a father.


8.8.2
4907
ἐπεὶ μέντοι Κῦρος ἐτελεύτησεν , εὐθὺς μὲν αὐτοῦ οἱ παῖδες ἐστασίαζον , εὐθὺς δὲ πόλεις καὶ ἔθνη ἀφίσταντο , πάντα δ’ ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον ἐτρέποντο .
Still, as soon as Cyrus was dead, his children at once fell into dissension, states and nations began to revolt, and everything began to deteriorate.


8.8.2
4908
ὡς δ’ ἀληθῆ λέγω ἄρξομαι διδάσκων ἐκ τῶν θείων .
And that what I say is the truth, I will prove, beginning with the Persians’ attitude toward religion.


8.8.2
4909
οἶδα γὰρ ὅτι πρότερον μὲν βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ ὑπ’ αὐτῷ καὶ τοῖς τὰ ἔσχατα πεποιηκόσιν εἴτε ὅρκους ὀμόσαιεν , ἠμπέδουν , εἴτε δεξιὰς δοῖεν , ἐβεβαίουν .
I know, for example, that in early times the kings and their officers, in their dealings with even the worst offenders, would abide by an oath that they might have given, and be true to any pledge they might have made.


8.8.3
4910
εἰ δὲ μὴ τοιοῦτοι ἦσαν καὶ τοιαύτην δόξαν εἶχον οὐδ’ ἂν εἷς αὐτοῖς ἐπίστευεν , ὥσπερ οὐδὲ νῦν πιστεύει οὐδὲ εἷς ἔτι , ἐπεὶ ἔγνωσται ἡ ἀσέβεια αὐτῶν .
For had they not had such a character for honour, and had they not been true to their reputation, not a man would have trusted them, just as not a single person any longer trusts them, now that their lack of character is notorious;


8.8.3
4911
οὕτως οὐδὲ τότε ἐπίστευσαν ἂν οἱ τῶν σὺν Κύρῳ ἀναβάντων στρατηγοί ·
and the generals of the Greeks who joined the expedition of Cyrus the Younger would not have had such confidence in them even on that occasion.


8.8.3
4912
νῦν δὲ δὴ τῇ πρόσθεν αὐτῶν δόξῃ πιστεύσαντες ἐνεχείρισαν ἑαυτούς , καὶ ἀναχθέντες πρὸς βασιλέα ἀπετμήθησαν τὰς κεφαλάς .
But, as it was, trusting in the previous reputation of the Persian kings, they placed themselves in the king’s power, were led into his presence, and had their heads cut off.


8.8.3
4913
πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ τῶν συστρατευσάντων βαρβάρων ἄλλοι ἄλλαις πίστεσιν ἐξαπατηθέντες ἀπώλοντο .
And many also of the barbarians who joined that expedition went to their doom, some deluded by one promise, others by another.


8.8.4
4914
πολὺ δὲ καὶ τάδε χείρονες νῦν εἰσι .
But at the present time they are still worse, as the following will show:


8.8.4
4915
πρόσθεν μὲν γὰρ εἴ τις ἢ διακινδυνεύσειε πρὸ βασιλέως ἢ πόλιν ἢ ἔθνος ὑποχείριον ποιήσειεν ἢ ἄλλο τι καλὸν ἢ ἀγαθὸν αὐτῷ διαπράξειεν , οὗτοι ἦσαν οἱ τιμώμενοι ·
if, for example, any one in the olden times risked his life for the king, or if any one reduced a state or a nation to submission to him, or effected anything else of good or glory for him, such an one received honour and preferment;


8.8.4
4916
νῦν δὲ καὶ ἤν τις ὥσπερ Μιθριδάτης τὸν πατέρα Ἀριοβαρζάνην προδούς , καὶ ἤν τις ὥσπερ Ῥεομίθρης τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τοὺς τῶν φίλων παῖδας ὁμήρους παρὰ τῷ Αἰγυπτίῳ ἐγκαταλιπὼν καὶ τοὺς μεγίστους ὅρκους παραβὰς βασιλεῖ δόξῃ τι σύμφορον ποιῆσαι , οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ ταῖς μεγίσταις τιμαῖς γεραιρόμενοι .
now, on the other hand, if any one seems to bring some advantage to the king by evil-doing, whether as Mithradates did, by betraying his own father Ariobarzanes, or as a certain Rheomithres did, in violating his most sacred oaths and leaving his wife and children and the children of his friends behind as hostages in the power of the king of Egypt — such are the ones who now have the highest honours heaped upon them.


8.8.5
4917
ταῦτ’ οὖν ὁρῶντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ πάντες ἐπὶ τὸ ἀσεβὲς καὶ τὸ ἄδικον τετραμμένοι εἰσίν ·
Witnessing such a state of morality, all the inhabitants of Asia have been turned to wickedness and wrong-doing.


8.8.5
4918
ὁποῖοί τινες γὰρ ἂν οἱ προστάται ὦσι , τοιοῦτοι καὶ οἱ ὑπ’ αὐτοὺς ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ γίγνονται .
For, whatever the character of the rulers is, such also that of the people under them for the most part becomes.


8.8.5
4919
ἀθεμιστότεροι δὴ νῦν ἢ πρόσθεν ταύτῃ γεγένηνται .
In this respect they are now even more unprincipled than before.


8.8.6
4920
εἴς γε μὴν χρήματα τῇδε ἀδικώτεροι ·
In money matters, too, they are more dishonest in this particular:


8.8.6
4921
οὐ γὰρ μόνον τοὺς πολλὰ ἡμαρτηκότας , ἀλλ’ ἤδη τοὺς οὐδὲν ἠδικηκότας συλλαμβάνοντες ἀναγκάζουσι πρὸς οὐδὲν δίκαιον χρήματα ἀποτίνειν ·
they arrest not merely those who have committed many offences, but even those who have done no wrong, and against all justice compel them to pay fines;


8.8.6
4922
ὥστ’ οὐδὲν ἧττον οἱ πολλὰ ἔχειν δοκοῦντες τῶν πολλὰ ἠδικηκότων φοβοῦνται ·
and so those who are supposed to be rich are kept in a state of terror no less than those who have committed many crimes,


8.8.6
4923
καὶ εἰς χεῖρας οὐδ’ οὗτοι ἐθέλουσι τοῖς κρείττοσιν ἰέναι .
and they are no more willing than malefactors are to come into close relations with their superiors in power;


8.8.6
4924
οὐδέ γε ἁθροίζεσθαι εἰς βασιλικὴν στρατιὰν θαρροῦσι .
in fact, they do not even venture to enlist in the royal army.


8.8.7
4925
τοιγαροῦν ὅστις ἂν πολεμῇ αὐτοῖς , πᾶσιν ἔξεστιν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ αὐτῶν ἀναστρέφεσθαι ἄνευ μάχης ὅπως ἂν βούλωνται διὰ τὴν ἐκείνων περὶ μὲν θεοὺς ἀσέβειαν , περὶ δὲ ἀνθρώπους ἀδικίαν .
Accordingly, owing to their impiety toward the gods and their iniquity toward man, any one who is engaged in war with them can, if he desire, range up and down their country without having to strike a blow.


8.8.7
4926
αἱ μὲν δὴ γνῶμαι ταύτῃ τῷ παντὶ χείρους νῦν ἢ τὸ παλαιὸν αὐτῶν .
Their principles in so far, therefore, are in every respect worse now than they were in antiquity.


8.8.8
4927
ὡς δὲ οὐδὲ τῶν σωμάτων ἐπιμέλονται ὥσπερ πρόσθεν , νῦν αὖ τοῦτο διηγήσομαι .
In the next place, as I will now show, they do not care for their physical strength as they used to do.


8.8.8
4928
νόμιμον γὰρ δὴ ἦν αὐτοῖς μήτε πτύειν μήτε ἀπομύττεσθαι .
For example, it used to be their custom neither to spit nor to blow the nose.


8.8.8
4929
δῆλον δὲ ὅτι ταῦτα οὐ τοῦ ἐν τῷ σώματι ὑγροῦ φειδόμενοι ἐνόμισαν , ἀλλὰ βουλόμενοι διὰ πόνων καὶ ἱδρῶτος τὰ σώματα στερεοῦσθαι .
It is obvious that they observed this custom not for the sake of saving the moisture in the body, but from the wish to harden the body by labour and perspiration.


8.8.8
4930
νῦν δὲ τὸ μὲν μὴ πτύειν μηδὲ ἀπομύττεσθαι ἔτι διαμένει , τὸ δ’ ἐκπονεῖν οὐδαμοῦ ἐπιτηδεύεται .
But now the custom of refraining from spitting or blowing the nose still continues, but they never give themselves the trouble to work off the moisture in some other direction.


8.8.9
4931
καὶ μὴν πρόσθεν μὲν ἦν αὐτοῖς μονοσιτεῖν νόμιμον , ὅπως ὅλῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ χρῷντο εἰς τὰς πράξεις καὶ εἰς τὸ διαπονεῖσθαι .
In former times it was their custom also to eat but once in the day, so that they might devote the whole day to business and hard work.


8.8.9
4932
νῦν γε μὴν τὸ μὲν μονοσιτεῖν ἔτι διαμένει , ἀρχόμενοι δὲ τοῦ σίτου ἡνίκαπερ οἱ πρῳαίτατα ἀριστῶντες μέχρι τούτου ἐσθίοντες καὶ πίνοντες διάγουσιν ἔστεπερ οἱ ὀψιαίτατα κοιμώμενοι .
Now, to be sure, the custom of eating but once a day still prevails, but they begin to eat at the hour when those who breakfast earliest begin their morning meal, and they keep on eating and drinking until the hour when those who stay up latest go to bed.


8.8.10
4933
ἦν δ’ αὐτοῖς νόμιμον μηδὲ προχοΐδας εἰσφέρεσθαι εἰς τὰ συμπόσια , δῆλον ὅτι νομίζοντες τὸ μὴ ὑπερπίνειν ἧττον ἂν καὶ σώματα καὶ γνώμας σφάλλειν ·
They had also the custom of not bringing pots into their banquets, evidently because they thought that if one did not drink to excess, both mind and body would be less uncertain.


8.8.10
4934
νῦν δὲ τὸ μὲν μὴ εἰσφέρεσθαι ἔτι αὖ διαμένει , τοσοῦτον δὲ πίνουσιν ὥστε ἀντὶ τοῦ εἰσφέρειν αὐτοὶ ἐκφέρονται , ἐπειδὰν μηκέτι δύνωνται ὀρθούμενοι ἐξιέναι .
So even now the custom of not bringing in the pots still obtains, but they drink so much that, instead of carrying anything in, they are themselves carried out when they are no longer able to stand straight enough to walk out.


8.8.11
4935
ἀλλὰ μὴν κ- ἐκεῖνο ἦν αὐτοῖς ἐπιχώριον τὸ μεταξὺ πορευομένους μήτε ἐσθίειν μήτε πίνειν μήτε τῶν διὰ ταῦτα ἀναγκαίων μηδὲν ποιοῦντας φανεροὺς εἶναι ·
Again, this also was a native custom of theirs, neither to eat nor drink while on a march, nor yet to be seen doing any of the necessary consequences of eating or drinking.


8.8.11
4936
νῦν δ’ αὖ τὸ μὲν τούτων ἀπέχεσθαι ἔτι διαμένει , τὰς μέντοι πορείας οὕτω βραχείας ποιοῦνται ὡς μηδέν’ ἂν ἔτι θαυμάσαι τὸ ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν ἀναγκαίων .
Even yet that same abstinence prevails, but they make their journeys so short that no one would be surprised at their ability to resist those calls of nature.


8.8.12
4937
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ ἐπὶ θήραν πρόσθεν μὲν τοσαυτάκις ἐξῇσαν ὥστε ἀρκεῖν αὐτοῖς τε καὶ ἵπποις γυμνάσια τὰς θήρας ·
Again, in times past they used to go out hunting so often that the hunts afforded sufficient exercise for both men and horses.


8.8.12
4938
ἐπεὶ δὲ Ἀρταξέρξης ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ ἥττους τοῦ οἴνου ἐγένοντο , οὐκέτι ὁμοίως οὔτ’ αὐτοὶ ἐξῇσαν οὔτε τοὺς ἄλλους ἐξῆγον ἐπὶ τὰς θήρας ·
But since Artaxerxes and his court became the victims of wine, they have neither gone out themselves in the old way nor taken the others out hunting;


8.8.12
4939
ἀλλὰ καὶ εἴ τινες φιλόπονοι γενόμενοι καὶ σὺν τοῖς περὶ αὑτοὺς ἱππεῦσι θαμὰ θηρῷεν , φθονοῦντες αὐτοῖς δῆλοι ἦσαν καὶ ὡς βελτίονας αὑτῶν ἐμίσουν .
on the contrary, if any one often went hunting with his friends out of sheer love for physical exertion, the courtiers would not hide their jealousy and would hate him as presuming to be a better man than they.


8.8.13
4940
ἀλλά τοι καὶ τοὺς παῖδας τὸ μὲν παιδεύεσθαι ἐπὶ ταῖς θύραις ἔτι διαμένει ·
Again, it is still the custom for the boys to be educated at court;


8.8.13
4941
τὸ μέντοι τὰ ἱππικὰ μανθάνειν καὶ μελετᾶν ἀπέσβηκε διὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ὅπου ἂν ἀποφαινόμενοι εὐδοκιμοῖεν .
but instruction and practice in horsemanship have died out, because there are no occasions on which they may give an exhibition and win distinction for skill.


8.8.13
4942
καὶ ὅτι γε οἱ παῖδες ἀκούοντες ἐκεῖ πρόσθεν τὰς δίκας δικαίως δικαζομένας ἐδόκουν μανθάνειν δικαιότητα , καὶ τοῦτο παντάπασιν ἀνέστραπται ·
And while anciently the boys used there to hear cases at law justly decided and so to learn justice, as they believed — that also has been entirely reversed;


8.8.13
4943
σαφῶς γὰρ ὁρῶσι νικῶντας ὁπότεροι ἂν πλέον διδῶσιν .
for now they see all too clearly that whichever party gives the larger bribe wins the case.


8.8.14
4944
ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν φυομένων ἐκ τῆς γῆς τὰς δυνάμεις οἱ παῖδες πρόσθεν μὲν ἐμάνθανον , ὅπως τοῖς μὲν ὠφελίμοις χρῷντο , τῶν δὲ βλαβερῶν ἀπέχοιντο ·
The boys of that time used also to learn the properties of the products of the earth, so as to avail themselves of the useful ones and keep away from those that were harmful.


8.8.14
4945
νῦν δὲ ἐοίκασι ταῦτα διδασκομένοις , ὅπως ὅτι πλεῖστα κακοποιῶσιν ·
But now it looks as if they learned them only in order to do as much harm as possible;


8.8.14
4946
οὐδαμοῦ γοῦν πλείους ἢ ἐκεῖ οὔτ’ ἀποθνῄσκουσιν οὔτε διαφθείρονται ὑπὸ φαρμάκων .
at any rate, there is no place where more people die or lose their lives from poisons than there.


8.8.15
4947
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ θρυπτικώτεροι πολὺ νῦν ἢ ἐπὶ Κύρου εἰσί .
Furthermore, they are much more effeminate now than they were in Cyrus’s day.


8.8.15
4948
τότε μὲν γὰρ ἔτι τῇ ἐκ Περσῶν παιδείᾳ καὶ ἐγκρατείᾳ ἐχρῶντο , τῇ δὲ Μήδων στολῇ καὶ ἁβρότητι ·
For at that time they still adhered to the old discipline and the old abstinence that they received from the Persians, but adopted the Median garb and Median luxury;


8.8.15
4949
νῦν δὲ τὴν μὲν ἐκ Περσῶν καρτερίαν περιορῶσιν ἀποσβεννυμένην , τὴν δὲ τῶν Μήδων μαλακίαν διασῴζονται .
now, on the contrary, they are allowing the rigour of the Persians to die out, while they keep up the effeminacy of the Medes.


8.8.16
4950
σαφηνίσαι δὲ βούλομαι καὶ τὴν θρύψιν αὐτῶν .
I should like to explain their effeminacy more in detail.


8.8.16
4951
ἐκείνοις γὰρ πρῶτον μὲν τὰς εὐνὰς οὐ μόνον ἀρκεῖ μαλακῶς ὑποστόρνυσθαι , ἀλλ’ ἤδη καὶ τῶν κλινῶν τοὺς πόδας ἐπὶ ταπίδων τιθέασιν , ὅπως μὴ ἀντερείδῃ τὸ δάπεδον , ἀλλ’ ὑπείκωσιν αἱ τάπιδες .
In the first place, they are not satisfied with only having their couches upholstered with down, but they actually set the posts of their beds upon carpets, so that the floor may offer no resistance, but that the carpets may yield.


8.8.16
4952
καὶ μὴν τὰ πεττόμενα ἐπὶ τράπεζαν ὅσα τε πρόσθεν ηὕρητο , οὐδὲν αὐτῶν ἀφῄρηται , ἄλλα τε ἀεὶ καινὰ ἐπιμηχανῶνται ·
Again, whatever sorts of bread and pastry for the table had been discovered before, none of all those have fallen into disuse, but they keep on always inventing something new besides;


8.8.16
4953
καὶ ὄψα γε ὡσαύτως ·
and it is the same way with meats;


8.8.16
4954
καὶ γὰρ καινοποιητὰς ἀμφοτέρων τούτων κέκτηνται .
for in both branches of cookery they actually have artists to invent new dishes.


8.8.17
4955
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι οὐ μόνον κεφαλὴν καὶ σῶμα καὶ πόδας ἀρκεῖ αὐτοῖς ἐσκεπάσθαι , ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ ἄκραις ταῖς χερσὶ χειρῖδας δασείας καὶ δακτυλήθρας ἔχουσιν .
Again, in winter they are not satisfied with having clothing on their heads and bodies and legs, but they must have also sleeves thickly lined to the very tips of their fingers, and gloves besides.


8.8.17
4956
ἔν γε μὴν τῷ θέρει οὐκ ἀρκοῦσιν αὐτοῖς οὔθ’ αἱ τῶν δένδρων οὔθ’ αἱ τῶν πετρῶν σκιαί , ἀλλ’ ἐν ταύταις ἑτέρας σκιὰς ἄνθρωποι μηχανώμενοι αὐτοῖς παρεστᾶσι .
In summer, on the other hand, they are not satisfied with the shade afforded by the trees and rocks, but amid these they have people stand by them to provide artificial shade.


8.8.18
4957
καὶ μὴν ἐκπώματα ἢν μὲν ὡς πλεῖστα ἔχωσι , τούτῳ καλλωπίζονται ·
They take great pride also in having as many cups as possible;


8.8.18
4958
ἢν δ’ ἐξ ἀδίκου φανερῶς ᾖ μεμηχανημένα , οὐδὲν τοῦτο αἰσχύνονται ·
but they are not ashamed if it transpire that they came by them by dishonest means,


8.8.18
4959
πολὺ γὰρ ηὔξηται ἐν αὐτοῖς ἡ ἀδικία τε καὶ αἰσχροκέρδεια .
for dishonesty and sordid love of gain have greatly increased among them.


8.8.19
4960
ἀλλὰ καὶ πρόσθεν μὲν ἦν ἐπιχώριον αὐτοῖς μὴ ὁρᾶσθαι πεζῇ πορευομένοις , οὐκ ἄλλου τινὸς ἕνεκα ἢ τοῦ ὡς ἱππικωτάτους γίγνεσθαι ·
Furthermore, it was of old a national custom not to be seen going anywhere on foot; and that was for no other purpose than to make themselves as knightly as possible.


8.8.19
4961
νῦν δὲ στρώματα πλείω ἔχουσιν ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων ἢ ἐπὶ τῶν εὐνῶν ·
But now they have more coverings upon their horses than upon their beds,


8.8.19
4962
οὐ γὰρ τῆς ἱππείας οὕτως ὥσπερ τοῦ μαλακῶς καθῆσθαι ἐπιμέλονται .
for they do not care so much for knighthood as for a soft seat.


8.8.20
4963
τά γε μὴν πολεμικὰ πῶς οὐκ εἰκότως νῦν τῷ παντὶ χείρους ἢ πρόσθεν εἰσίν ;
And so is it not to be expected that in military prowess they should be wholly inferior to what they used to be?


8.8.20
4964
οἷς ἐν μὲν τῷ παρελθόντι χρόνῳ ἐπιχώριον εἶναι ὑπῆρχε τοὺς μὲν τὴν γῆν ἔχοντας ἀπὸ ταύτης ἱππότας παρέχεσθαι , οἳ δὴ καὶ ἐστρατεύοντο εἰ δέοι στρατεύεσθαι , τοὺς δὲ φρουροῦντας πρὸ τῆς χώρας μισθοφόρους εἶναι ·
In times past it was their national custom that those who held lands should furnish cavalrymen from their possessions and that these, in case of war, should also take the field, while those who performed outpost duty in defence of the country received pay for their services.


8.8.20
4965
νῦν δὲ τούς τε θυρωροὺς καὶ τοὺς σιτοποιοὺς καὶ τοὺς ὀψοποιοὺς καὶ οἰνοχόους καὶ λουτροχόους καὶ παρατιθέντας καὶ ἀναιροῦντας καὶ κατακοιμίζοντας καὶ ἀνιστάντας , καὶ τοὺς κοσμητάς , οἳ ὑποχρίουσί τε καὶ ἐντρίβουσιν αὐτοὺς καὶ τ- ἄλλα ῥυθμίζουσι , τούτους πάντας ἱππέας οἱ δυνάσται πεποιήκασιν , ὅπως μισθοφορῶσιν αὐτοῖς .
But now the rulers make knights out of their porters, bakers, cooks, cup-bearers, bath-room attendants, butlers, waiters, chamberlains who assist them in retiring at night and in rising in the morning, and beauty-doctors who pencil their eyes and rouge their cheeks for them and otherwise beautify them; these are the sort that they make into knights to serve for pay for them.


8.8.21
4966
πλῆθος μὲν οὖν καὶ ἐκ τούτων φαίνεται , οὐ μέντοι ὄφελός γε οὐδὲν αὐτῶν εἰς πόλεμον ·
From such recruits, therefore, a host is obtained, but they are of no use in war;


8.8.21
4967
δηλοῖ δὲ καὶ αὐτὰ τὰ γιγνόμενα ·
and that is clear from actual occurrences:


8.8.21
4968
κατὰ γὰρ τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν ῥᾷον οἱ πολέμιοι ἢ οἱ φίλοι ἀναστρέφονται .
for enemies may range up and down their land with less hindrance than friends.


8.8.22
4969
καὶ γὰρ δὴ ὁ Κῦρος τοῦ μὲν ἀκροβολίζεσθαι ἀποπαύσας , θωρακίσας δὲ καὶ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἵππους καὶ ἓν παλτὸν ἑκάστῳ δοὺς εἰς χεῖρα ὁμόθεν τὴν μάχην ἐποιεῖτο ·
For Cyrus had abolished skirmishing at a distance, had armed both horses and men with breastplates, had put a javelin into each man’s hand, and had introduced the method of fighting hand to hand.


8.8.22
4970
νῦν δὲ οὔτε ἀκροβολίζονται ἔτι οὔτ’ εἰς χεῖρας συνιόντες μάχονται .
But now they neither skirmish at a distance any longer, nor yet do they fight in a hand-to-hand engagement.


8.8.23
4971
καὶ οἱ πεζοὶ ἔχουσι μὲν γέρρα καὶ κοπίδας καὶ σαγάρεις ὥσπερ οἱ ἐπὶ Κύρου τὴν μάχην ποιησάμενοι ·
The infantry still have their wicker shields and bills and sabres, just as those had who set the battle in array in the times of Cyrus;


8.8.23
4972
εἰς χεῖρας δὲ ἰέναι οὐδ’ οὗτοι ἐθέλουσιν .
but not even they are willing to come into a hand-to-hand conflict.


8.8.24
4973
οὐδέ γε τοῖς δρεπανηφόροις ἅρμασιν ἔτι χρῶνται ἐφ’ ᾧ Κῦρος αὐτὰ ἐποιήσατο .
Neither do they employ the scythed chariot any longer for the purpose for which Cyrus had it made.


8.8.24

ὁ μὲν γὰρ τιμαῖς αὐξήσας τοὺς ἡνιόχους καὶ ἀγαστοὺς ποιήσας εἶχε τοὺς εἰς τὰ ὅπλα ἐμβαλοῦντας ·
For he advanced the charioteers to honour and made them objects of admiration and so had men who were ready to hurl themselves against even a heavy-armed line.

οἱ δὲ νῦν οὐδὲ γιγνώσκοντες τοὺς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἅρμασιν οἴονται σφίσιν ὁμοίους τοὺς ἀνασκήτους τοῖς ἠσκηκόσιν ἔσεσθαι .
The officers of the present day, however, do not so much as know the men in the chariots, and they think that untrained drivers will be just as serviceable to them as trained charioteers.


8.8.25
4976
οἱ δὲ ὁρμῶσι μέν , πρὶν δ’ ἐν τοῖς πολεμίοις εἶναι οἱ μὲν ἄκοντες ἐκπίπτουσιν , οἱ δ’ ἐξάλλονται , ὥστε ἄνευ ἡνιόχων γιγνόμενα τὰ ζεύγη πολλάκις πλείω κακὰ τοὺς φίλους ἢ τοὺς πολεμίους ποιεῖ .
Such untrained men do indeed charge, but before they penetrate the enemy’s lines some of them are unintentionally thrown out, some of them jump out on purpose, and so the teams without drivers often create more havoc on their own side than on the enemy’s.


8.8.26
4977
ἐπεὶ μέντοι καὶ αὐτοὶ γιγνώσκουσιν οἷα σφίσι τὰ πολεμιστήρια ὑπάρχει , ὑφίενται , καὶ οὐδεὶς ἔτι ἄνευ Ἑλλήνων εἰς πόλεμον καθίσταται , οὔτε ὅταν ἀλλήλοις πολεμῶσιν οὔτε ὅταν οἱ Ἕλληνες αὐτοῖς ἀντιστρατεύωνται ·
However, inasmuch as even they understand what sort of material for war they have, they abandon the effort; and no one ever goes to war any more without the help of Greek mercenaries, be it when they are at war with one another or when the Greeks make war upon them;


8.8.26
4978
ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς τούτους ἐγνώκασι μεθ’ Ἑλλήνων τοὺς πολέμους ποιεῖσθαι .
but even against Greeks they recognize that they can conduct their wars only with the assistance of Greeks.


8.8.27

ἐγὼ μὲν δὴ οἶμαι ἅπερ ὑπεθέμην ἀπειργάσθαι μοι .
I think now that I have accomplished the task that I set before myself.


8.8.27
4980
φημὶ γὰρ Πέρσας καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀσεβεστέρους περὶ θεοὺς καὶ ἀνοσιωτέρους περὶ συγγενεῖς καὶ ἀδικωτέρους περὶ τοὺς ἄλλους καὶ ἀνανδροτέρους τὰ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον νῦν ἢ πρόσθεν ἀποδεδεῖχθαι .
For I maintain that I have proved that the Persians of the present day and those living in their dependencies are less reverent toward the gods, less dutiful to their relatives, less upright in their dealings with all men, and less brave in war than they were of old.


8.8.27
4981
εἰ δέ τις τ- ἐναντία ἐμοὶ γιγνώσκοι , τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν ἐπισκοπῶν εὑρήσει αὐτὰ μαρτυροῦντα τοῖς ἐμοῖς λόγοις .
But if any one should entertain an opinion contrary to my own, let him examine their deeds and he will find that these testify to the truth of my statements.
